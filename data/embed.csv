0,"Washington has chosen to start 2020 by bringing its already strained relations with Iran to a whole new level of confrontation as it ordered the killing of one of Tehran’s top generals Qassem Soleimani. The high-profile assassination is bound to make things difficult for the State Department. And that’s not to mention that it is far from being the only problem Pompeo and his staff have on their hands. Yet instead of seeking to revive stalled denuclearization talks with North Korea or soothing the ruffled feathers of European NATO allies the secretary of state plans to visit several former Soviet republics: Belarus Ukraine Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in the vast Central Asian steppes. Most Americans may be forgiven for ""knowing"" about Kazakhstan via English comedian Sasha Baron Cohen’s 2006 movie 'Borat' which actually has nothing to do with the country and is sort of offensive to bring up there. The Central Asian nation independent since 1991 has signed treaties on cooperation with both the US and NATO while maintaining cordial relations with Moscow and Beijing. So what awaits Pompeo in Nur-Sultan formerly Astana Kazakhstan's capital recently renamed in honor of its first president? The level of interaction between Washington and Nur-Sultan was “stable but relatively weak” Vladimir Batyuk a senior fellow at the Russian Institute for the US and Canadian Studies told RT. “Their common arrangements have been usually limited to some low-level meetings.” America’s renewed interest to Kazakhstan might be a result of the recent developments in nearby Afghanistan where the 18-year-long war is showing no sign of ending well for Washington. President Donald Trump's promise to pull out of America's longest war was thwarted at the very beginning of his administration by hawkish establishment advisers. Later he abruptly canceled peace talks with the Taliban militants when a peace deal seemed within reach. Recent reports that US generals and officials had known for years that the war in Afghanistan was unwinnable may help nudge Washington into actually calling it quits however. That is not to say the US has given up on the dream of having a base in the region though and Kazakhstan may seem like a good prospect to some in Foggy Bottom. “Now they would need Central Asia as its base of operations” Aleksey Pilko director of the Eurasian Communications Center told RT. US withdrawal from Afghanistan is almost guaranteed to result in the resurgence of the Taliban. The hardline Islamist militants already control much of the country. Washington may seek to expand its influence in neighboring countries by bringing up potential security issues and counter-terrorism cooperation. However a withdrawal from Afghanistan is also likely to weaken the US position in the region and make it that much more difficult to position itself as a security provider for Central Asian nations Pilko believes. Kazakhstan is a major regional power and the biggest state in Central Asia at one time contributing 60 percent of the regional GDP. It is also a major uranium exporter and has significant oil and gas reserves. These facts alone could be enough for Washington to turn its eye to Nur-Sultan. What might be equally important is that Kazakhstan is conveniently located between Washington's two major geopolitical adversaries – China and Russia – which makes it a very valuable piece in the geostrategic puzzle. In fact Washington has indeed become conspicuously interested in “strengthening bilateral relations” with Nur-Sultan after longstanding Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev – a close ally and friend of Russia’s Vladimir Putin – stepped down to give way to a younger national leader. “Kazakhstan is a key state in the region so it is no wonder that the US state secretary pays a visit there” Pilko explained. “The Kazakh leadership has changed… Now the US sees a need to sound out the situation and talk to the former and the current presidents to find out what is happening and what the new leader’s policy will be.” Pompeo has already given a warm welcome to the Kazakh Foreign Minister Mukhtar Tleuberdi in Washington in mid-December and claimed on Twitter that the “strategic partnership” between the two nations “has never been stronger.” The State Department then rushed to laud growing commercial ties between the US and Kazakhstan as well as President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s “ambitious reform agenda” adding that the “human rights crisis” in neighboring Chinese Xinjiang and “lasting peace” in Afghanistan were also discussed during the meeting. It is on Tleuberdi’s invitation that Pompeo is now planning to arrive to Kazakhstan. Little is officially known about this supposed trip so far however with most news coming from Kazakh officials. ""The program will be eventful” Kazakh Foreign Ministry spokesman Aybek Smadiyarov told journalists in early December. Other reports suggested that Pompeo will unveil nothing less than a new US strategy for Central Asia during the visit. Washington might have good reasons to approach Kazakhstan. However whether it has the means to achieve its goals is another matter entirely. Even if Pompeo plays the US security assistance card during his visit it is unclear whether that will be enough to sway the local establishment’s opinions in favor of Washington’s plans for the region. Kazakhstan is already deeply integrated with Russia and several other former Soviet Republics both in economic and military fields. The nation is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) – an inter-governmental military alliance which also includes Russia Armenia Belarus and two of Kazakhstan’s Central Asian neighbors Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The bloc is primarily tasked with fending off any military aggression against its members as well as fighting terrorism. Kazakhstan is also a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) an economic integration body. The EAEU is roughly similar to the EU’s Common Market in that it allows free movement of goods services and people and sets out common policies in various fields of economy ranging from transport industry energy and agriculture to customs and investment. In addition to Russia and Kazakhstan it also includes Belarus Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. It is also worth noting that China and Russia - not the US - are Kazakhstan’s biggest trading partners. Almost 40 percent of Kazakhstan’s imports come from Russia with an additional 16 percent arriving from China. US goods by comparison amount to slightly more than four percent. China is also the second most important Kazakh export market while Russia is the fourth one. However meticulously Pompeo plans to study all the peculiarities of Kazakh politics during his upcoming visit Tokayev has already quite openly said that he would follow the steps of his predecessor in international relations which most likely means continued close cooperation with both Russia and China. The biggest obstacle to Pompeo’s potential diplomatic success might however lie not in Nur-Sultan but in Washington itself Batyuk believes. President Trump largely focuses on geo-economics in his foreign policy locking horns with adversaries and allies alike in his attempts to win extra trade preferences for the US. “It is economics that is important for Trump. In this regard Kazakhstan and Central Asia in general hardly have any place in his worldview at all. When the national leader does not exactly know what he wants from the region it is very difficult to develop any strategy here” the analyst said.

1,"The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) issued a request (RFI) late in December seeking the latest and greatest in AI and drone swarm tech – and looking for clever ideas on how to combine the two. The resulting smart-swarm the agency said should be self-directing able to find and track humans (“and manmade objects” the RFI specifies) on its own capable of streaming video of its activities and willing to nudge its minders (who won’t be minding it most of the time since it’s primarily AI-powered) when it has latched on to something interesting. The swarm will have to be able to move at least 50 knots (93 km/h) stay in the air for at least 2 hours and cover 100 square nautical miles (343 square km). The official purpose of the “smart swarm” is search and rescue the RFI explains while the JAIC program comprises four ""mission initiatives"" – ""predictive maintenance humanitarian aid and disaster relief and cyberspace and robotic process automation."" So where is number four? The RFI isn't telling but we can speculate based on what JAIC is known to do. The AI-specialist department which only debuted in 2018 ended up running Project Maven the initiative to weaponize machine-learning and Big Data that was supposedly rejected by Google after employees got cold feet about helping the Pentagon kill people. Project Maven has not only beefed up the quality of video input from tactical drones or used computing power to organize the mountains of data obtained through surveillance it has taught participants how to “use algorithms for war.”  Will a smart swarm capable of hunting humans with minimal outside direction – along the lines specified in the RFI – follow the rules and stick to search and rescue or will its AI confuse it with “search and destroy”? If the Pentagon’s humans can’t tell a civilian from a terrorist how are its drone swarms supposed to be able to? And even if the algorithms work just fine what’s to stop the humans in charge from using their new toys for killing? JAIC works with DARPA and other secretive high-level Pentagon agencies; if the US military were ever to develop a swarm of killer drones capable of operating without human input (they already have drone swarms that work with human guides) it would happen there. Before you think “but they wouldn’t dare” it would be exceedingly hard to prosecute an AI algorithm for war crimes especially one written in open source. We’ve seen this movie before literally. The “Hated in the Nation” episode of the techno-dystopian TV show Black Mirror features a swarm of autonomous drone “bees” who’ve taken the place of the real thing after a mass die-off; this digital hive proves hackable and every day a single solitary drone bee assassin is weaponized to kill whichever public figure garners the most social media hate. Bees lost at such a slow pace no matter the kamikaze drama of their last seconds mean the hive-minders never mind. The bee-masters in Black Mirror defend their creation by blustering about “military-grade” encryption insisting no one could ever hack their high-tech better-than-nature-made-them pollinators. By that point however someone already had.  Military-grade encryption is only as good as the backdoors deliberately installed in it and Attorney General William Barr and the whole Five Eyes intelligence network are intent on installing enough backdoors to keep them busy peeking through your private data for the rest of their lives. Once they do that everyone’s drone swarm – literally and figuratively – belongs to everyone else. If there was ever a time not to rush into manufacturing an apocalyptic technology it would be now.  Like this story? Share it with a friend!

2,"The 82nd’s alert brigade was ordered to deploy on Tuesday evening Fox News reported citing multiple Pentagon officials shortly before Defense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed the move. ""The United States will protect our people and interests anywhere they are found around the world"" Esper said announcing the deployment. The initial force has already departed Fort Bragg North Carolina on board C-17 transports. The Immediate Response Force (IRF) consists of an estimated 4000 soldiers of the 82nd Deployment Ready Brigade (DRB) whose three battalions can be fielded within 96 hours if needed. Hundreds of members of the Iraqi Shia militia Kataib Hezbollah stormed the US Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday chanting “Death to America” and setting the entrance checkpoint on fire. They were protesting against US airstrikes that killed 25 of their members over the weekend in what the Pentagon said was retaliation for last week’s rocket strike at a US base in Kirkuk that killed one contractor. The militia withdrew after a task force of some 100 US Marines accompanied by attack helicopters showed up to reinforce the embassy. US President Donald Trump has blamed Iran for the attack and openly threatened Tehran with a “big price” to pay. There are currently 60000 US troops in the Middle East of which some 5000 are in Iraq. Almost 14000 of those have been added since May 2019 with the Pentagon citing a rising “threat” from Iran. In May 2018 the Trump administration unilaterally repudiated the nuclear deal negotiated with Tehran in 2015 and imposed sanctions intended to destroy the Iranian economy. Despite Trump’s campaign rhetoric about ending US involvement in endless foreign wars his advisers have repeatedly called for what amounts to regime change in Tehran. Like this story?

3,From his perch on Twitter President Trump shared a brief video clip showing a line of parked cars set ablaze in Paris on the cusp of the New Year on Tuesday adding only a simple caption: While the motive behind the sizable (and likely quite expensive) 'car-b-que' remains unknown the arson comes amid mass demonstrations around the country in opposition to an overhaul of the French pension system which in some cases have erupted into violent street clashes with riot police. Trade unions and other labor organizations have staged mass strikes and walkouts over the proposal which the government insists will simplify the pension system and ensure it is “fair.” The wave of anti-pension reform demonstrations follows another protest movement sparked last year by a fuel tax hike the 'Yellow Vests' who have continued to stage mass actions intermittently ever since. The two groups joined forces over the weekend in a joint protest to voice discontent with Macron’s government. At President Trump’s direction in 2017 Washington ditched the Paris climate accord a multilateral agreement among a majority of the world’s nations dealing with greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues. Dismissing it as “draconian” Trump has repeatedly mocked Macron about the deal since the US withdrawal once even suggesting the accord itself was responsible for the country’s ongoing unrest.

4,Taking to Twitter on Tuesday evening hours after the embassy was nearly ransacked by members of the Iraqi Shia militia Kataib Hezbollah protesting against the US airstrike that killed 25 of their own over the weekend Pompeo posted photos purporting to show the alleged perpetrators of the failed storming attempt. “The attack today was orchestrated by terrorists – Abu Mahdi al Muhandis and Qays al-Khazali – and abetted by Iranian proxies – Hadi al Amari and Faleh al-Fayyad. All are pictured below outside our embassy” Pompeo wrote. The photos accompanying the post show the crowd outside the US Embassy on Tuesday Pompeo claimed arguing that the four militia leaders were mingling with the protesters. The top US diplomat did not produce evidence to support the claim that any of the photographed individuals played a role in stirring the unrest itself which was originally sparked by the US bombing raid and drew outrage from the Iraqi government and citizens alike. Pompeo then attempted to make a distinction between “the legitimate efforts of the Iraqi protesters” opposing the government in Baghdad and those behind the embassy attack. While the protests against pervasive corruption and the government’s failure to provide better living conditions for Iraqis have rocked the country since October and saw bloody clashes between security forces and demonstrators Pompeo did not miss a chance to point a finger at Tehran as the main culprit behind Iraq’s internal political woes arguing that corruption was “exported there by the Iranian regime.” Tehran has flatly rejected the allegations that it fanned the unrest slamming Washington’s “audacity” to blame Iran for protests triggered by American airstrikes which the Pentagon claimed were in retaliation for an attack on a US coalition base near the Iraqi city of Kirkuk. Iraq’s economy and infrastructure were left in a shambles after two decades of intermittent war and sectarian violence following the 2003 US invasion which also took a heavy toll on the average citizen leaving many without the most basic services including access to clean water.

5,With simmering tensions between Tehran and Washington flaring up over an attack on the US Embassy in Baghdad which the US blamed squarely on Iran without providing any proof there have been growing fears that another war of words could spiral into something far more violent. In an apparent attempt to diffuse the tension Trump said late on Tuesday that he does not foresee a war actually breaking out between the US and Iran. “War with Iran? I don’t think that would be a good idea for Iran... I like peace... I don’t see that happening” Trump told media as he arrived at the grand ballroom at Mar-a-Lago for a New Year bash on Tuesday night. Tehran has vehemently denied allegations that it is somehow complicit in the unrest sparked by US airstrikes that killed 25 members of the Iraqi Shia militia Kataib Hezbollah over the weekend. The American sorties have drawn the ire of the Iraqi government which called the bombing a violation of the country’s sovereignty as well as of militiamen and ordinary citizens who flocked to the US Embassy in Iraq to protest against the airstrikes. Protests turned violent on Tuesday as demonstrators attempted to storm the compound and saw US attack helicopters being scrambled to scatter the protesters after they'd reportedly breached the front gate. In the wake of the attack the Pentagon announced that it would send 750 paratroopers to the Middle East “immediately” in response to the incident which will be followed by “additional forces.” Washington has repeatedly invoked the “Iranian threat” to beef up its military presence in the region having deployed some 14000 troops to the Middle East since May 2019 in addition to about 60000 already stationed there.

6,Massachusetts senator and Democratic 2020 hopeful Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday took aim at the president for a US bombing raid ordered on an Iraqi militia over the weekend. American officials accused the group – Kataib Hezbollah – of carrying out a rocket attack on a US base with Iranian backing which killed one American contractor though they have yet to offer any evidence for the claims of responsibility. “Trump’s reckless decisions to walk away from the Iran deal and now to launch airstrikes in Iraq without Iraqi government consent have brought us closer to war and endangered US troops and diplomats” Warren said in a statement online. The US air raid left 25 Iraqi fighters dead and prompted a heated demonstration at the US Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday afternoon in which militiamen and ordinary citizens breached the front gate of the embassy complex smashing windows and scrawling anti-American slogans on its walls. Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) – who sponsored a bipartisan bill with Kentucky Republican Rand Paul to prevent an “unauthorized war” with the Islamic Republic earlier this year – also weighed in to slam Trump’s response to the unrest which included the deployment of a Marine task force and attack helicopters to defend the embassy. “At a volatile time the Trump administration’s reckless escalation and miscalculation are endangering US citizens &amp; pushing us closer to unauthorized war in the Middle East” Udall wrote in a tweet adding that “Congress needs to step in and stop it.” Democratic presidential candidate and Southbend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg joined his fellow lawmakers on Twitter to attack the president for “mood swings” and making “policy by tweet” arguing his actions in Iraq only served to put US “national interests in harm’s way.” Far from the most dovish Democrat vying for the 2020 nomination however Buttigieg accepted that the policies were a response to “Iranian aggression” despite disagreeing with them. Across the aisle some Republicans were far more supportive fully endorsing the commander-in-chief’s recent moves. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) credited Trump with “very solid work” and hailed the Marine deployment as a “decisive action” needed “in a time of crisis” insisting there was “zero question” about who was behind the rocket attack on the US base. One of Trump’s biggest boosters as of late Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) also lavished praise on the president after a meeting to discuss the tense situation in Iraq accusing Iran of threatening “American interests” and warning that they do so at their own risk. Comparing the embassy siege to a lethal attack on a US diplomatic facility in Libya in 2012 Graham urged that there be “no more Benghazis.” In the latest US response the Pentagon announced a deployment of some 750 paratroopers to neighboring Kuwait on Tuesday evening which Defense Secretary Mark Esper said could be mobilized in days to “protect our people and interests.” Though few lawmakers have yet weighed in on the new deployment the battle lines in Washington appear to already be drawn.

8,A woman seeking the Pope’s blessing on New Year’s Eve instead ended up enraging the pontiff after grabbing his arm to get his attention. A video of the altercation shows Francis walking through Vatican City as he greeted pilgrims. After reaching out to touch a child a nearby woman seized his hand jerking the religious leader around – a yank that appeared to cause him pain. After slapping her hand several times the Pope freed himself of her grip. The usually serene Francis scowled as he walked away. According to reports the Pope later acknowledged that he had “lost patience” with the admiring pilgrim. Francis has a history of repelling unwanted contact. In March he was criticized for refusing to allow members of the faithful to kiss his papal ring during a visit to an Italian shrine. Like this story?

9,Chandrayaan-3 India's third lunar exploration mission will attempt to land on the Moon again Jitendra Singh minister of state for department of space confirmed Wednesday. “Yes the [next] lander and rover mission will happen in 2020” he told the media. Singh said the new spacecraft will incorporate lessons learned during last year's Chandrayaan 2 mission which attempted to deploy a lander called Vikram but suddenly fell silent during hard touchdown “within 500m of the designated landing site.” However Chandrayaan 2 can't be seen as failure the official explained. Revealing some details about the mission ISRO chief K Sivan said that Chandrayaan-3 – which is set to launch in November this year – will be similar to its predecessor. “In Chandrayaan-3 we will have landing and rover with propulsion module” he said adding “this is going to be an eventful year for ISRO.” India is striving to become the fourth country after the US USSR and China to land on the Moon. Chandrayaan 2 stands out from other missions as it attempted to land at the little-explored South Pole. It was tasked with gathering data on the lunar surface searching for water and minerals. Among other things the mission’s goal was recording and measuring moonquakes. As part of an ambitious space exploration program India also hopes to launch the Gaganyaan India's first manned mission to space by 2022. ISRO has already done plenty of research and development work on the mission Sivan revealed. He said that four “final astronauts-elect” have been selected and they will start training in Russia “from the third week of January.” Think your friends would be interested?

10,Wednesday’s deployment used military helicopters and naval vessels to deliver water food and fuel to areas that have been completely cut off by the fires in the states of New South Wales and Victoria. An estimated 4000 people in the Victorian coastal town of Mallacoota fled to the seashore on Tuesday after winds pushed wildfires toward their homes. The Australian Defence Force is sending navy ships to Mallacoota on a supply mission that is expected to last two weeks Victoria Emergency Commissioner Andrew Crisp told local media. He said firefighters would be flown into the area via helicopter since the roads are no longer accessible. The massive bushfires have destroyed more than four million hectares (10 million acres). High winds and extreme heat have sparked new blazes almost daily. The fires have claimed 12 lives since the beginning of October. Australian government officials have called for assistance from the US and Canada to help contain the fires. Like this story?

11,"Dozens of protesters who'd camped overnight outside the gates of the embassy were attacked with tear gas by security personnel reportedly after the demonstrators drew closer to the building. Purported footage of Wednesday’s clashes shows protesters shouting and throwing objects toward the compound walls as thick smoke fills the air. Several bright flashes – likely from tear gas canisters being fired – can also be seen. The crowd also reportedly set multiple US flags on fire. Several protesters were wounded and were brought away in ambulances according to AFP. The skirmish comes a day after thousands of Iraqis marched on the compound to protest against US airstrikes that had targeted several Hezbollah positions. The demonstrators were able to pass through several checkpoints in the high-security Green Zone setting fires and destroying surveillance cameras. In response to the attack US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said around 750 troops were ready to deploy to the region over the next several days. President Donald Trump has blamed Iran for the turmoil and warned that Tehran would pay dearly if any US personnel were injured or killed by the demonstrators. Iran pushed back at the accusation noting that Washington had the “audacity” to blame the Islamic Republic for protests in Iraq. US airstrikes hit five Kataib Hezbollah targets in Iraq and Syria last week in retaliation for an attack on a US coalition base near Kirkuk. Washington blamed that attack on the Iran-allied militia but Tehran has denied any involvement calling the subsequent  US strikes an act of ""terrorism."" Like this story? Share it with a friend!

13,On the heels of the siege on Tuesday of the US diplomatic mission in Baghdad President Trump fired off a series of inflammatory tweets vowing to hold Iran “fully responsible for lives lost or damage incurred at any of our facilities.” Shortly thereafter he took a different tone saying he doesn’t see a war with Iran coming. But the initial escapade didn’t go unnoticed in Tehran with Ali Khamenei returning the verbal attack by “that guy.” The Supreme Leader stated that “you can’t do anything” before referring Trump to recent US invasions of countries bordering Iran. Khamenei has also taken aim at the US sorties which killed 25 members of Kataib Hezbollah – the Iraqi Shia militia that forms part of pro-Iranian Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) – last weekend. “Look at what the US is doing in Iraq and Syria. They’re taking revenge on Hashd al-Sha’bi for defeating ISIS [Islamic State]” he said in a tweet using an Arabic term for PMU. The strikes carried out without approval from Iraq sparked fury among its citizens with crowds sneaking into the heavily-guarded Green Zone and amassing outside the US Embassy on Tuesday. Many were shouting “Death to America!” and “Down with USA!” before trying to breach the compound. The US Ambassador and senior staff were moved to safety but the Pentagon swiftly sent 750 troops to Iraq in order to reinforce security in and around the mission. On Wednesday morning numerous protesters who'd camped overnight outside the main gates tried to come closer again hurling stones at the building. Embassy guards fired tear gas in response wounding several people. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

18,Deployed in the snowy Himalayan ridges of Kashmir a bunch of soldiers try their best to show off their team spirit. Standing atop a mountain their squad chanted some slogans before “wishing everybody a happy and a prosperous New Year.” Their brother-in-arms –serving tours of duty in the same region– staged a more sophisticated performance singing a patriotic song while also dancing in unison. In another video that surfaced on social media soldiers sing the praises of their country – also greeting the nation with the New Year. The Army’s Northern Command chose to be more serious uploading footage of troops flanking the national flag of India. All in all the service members could chill out somewhat during the New Year’s period passionately dancing to the authentic beats. Naturally the videos were received quite well by Indian twitterati who thanked them for their selfless service. “Heart goes out to their warm spirit in those punishing cold conditions” one woman wrote.

19,In a new publication from Zero Waste Scotland entomophagy (the practice of humans eating insects) could be the future with the report suggesting that a change from cattle to critters could be lucrative and better for the environment. Dr William Clark ZWS’s bio-economy specialist says that insects would offer a sustainable way to produce more food using less resources: “Insect farms offer a reliable sustainable circular-economy solution to the protein gap. For although the world produces enough food for everyone more than a third of it goes to waste so people don’t get the protein they need.” With half a million tons of agricultural feedstock thrown away each year the report also adds that using just 10 percent of that for insect farming would produce almost six million pounds for the Scottish economy. For those wanting to start their own farm it’s good to note that in one year bugs produce about 100 times more protein from the same amount of space than you would get by farming sheep or cows and insects can also produce valuable by-products such as biodiesel bioplastics and organic fertilizers. But are eco warriors prepared to eat black soldier flies and field crickets in a quest to save the planet? While the food buzz around creepy critters has been around for a few years a company in Cape Town suggests you eat your food container too. Munchbowls are an eco-friendly green alternative to toxic wasteful plastic and polystyrene food containers. Made with biodegradable wheat they can be stored for up to 15 months and they are vegan too. Meanwhile environmentalists wanting the whole package in 2020 should take note of Avani a company based in Bali who have created an edible bag. Made from cassava root starch and other natural resins they break down within three to six months and can be dissolved or eaten. When that diet leads to inevitable suicidal thoughts why not finish off with a cannabis cookie for desert? The global market for both legal and illegal cannabis stands at $150 billion and 2020 is set to see that figure steadily grow. Spiros Malandrakis from market research company Euromonitor says the industry is just at its beginning: “I think in the next two to three years we will start seeing a vast number of other cannabinoids that are not yet under the limelight. There’s a million questions to be asked and we’re just scratching the surface.” With unlimited articles TV shows forums and celebrities now discussing the positive medical uses of cannabis it seems the negative reputation of weed-smoking grungy students is slowly morphing into being more socially accepted. Cannabis is also getting green - with new sustainable cultivation and manufacturing practices used by several companies in America. Manufacturers are now looking at environmentally friendly production methods in regards to irrigation and farming in the hope to appease plant-loving eco warriors. Whether enjoying an insectivorous diet or eating carrier bags will become a cultural phenomenon for the eco-conscious or not the roaring twenties will no doubt see many fads attempting to become mainstream. Let’s just hope they taste as good as the ideas themselves. Like this story? Share it with a friend! , https://www.rt.com/news/477273-eating-insects-save-environment/,None
20,Live footage from RT’s video agency Ruptly showed protesters with Hezbollah flags withdrawing en masse in their vehicles. Some lingered behind at the scene of the clashes where tear gas and stun grenades were reportedly fired again on Wednesday. By Wednesday evening however the US military stated that all had departed. Hordes of protesters descended on Baghdad’s American embassy – located inside the heavily fortified ‘Green Zone’ – on Tuesday. Incensed by Sunday’s US airstrikes against the Kataib Hezbollah militia the crowd lit fires and pelted the embassy with stones. A contingent of US Marines arrived on Tuesday night to bolster security. Kataib Hezbollah is an Iranian-backed Shi’ite militia allied with an umbrella group of similar militias known as the ‘Popular Mobilization Forces’ (PMF) who are supposed to be under the command of the Iraqi military. The PMF on Wednesday told the crowds at the embassy to withdraw claiming that their “message has been heard” and to allow the Iraqi government to “preserve the prestige of the state.” However the call to pull back was initially been ignored by a number of the protesters. While some stood down a faction of hardliners remained behind until Wednesday evening. The embassy said in a statment that evening that all consular operations have been suspended until further notice. Washington has blamed Iran for orchestrating the embassy riots and for directing militias like Kataib Hezbollah to attack its forces in Iraq. Tehran denies all responsibility with Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei telling Trump that “your crimes in Iraq Afghanistan… have made nations hate you.” With the embassy showdown turning into another proxy battle between Iran and the US Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has sought to balance relations with both sides. The PM called the US airstrikes a “vicious assault that will have dangerous consequences” but warned protesters against any aggression towards foreign embassies. Like this story?

21,"Puzzled viewers of Ukraine's 5 Kanal and Pryamiy channel discovered that the two seemingly preferred Poroshenko to the actual President Volodymyr Zelensky on New Year's Eve. The man was given airtime right before midnight when the whole country gathered in front of their TVs with champagne-filled glasses. But was it an epic fail or an epic provocation? The latter seems to be the case as Poroshenko who is a major oligarch in Ukraine with a successful confectionery business and other assets is the official owner of 5 Kanal. The 54-year-old is also linked to Pryamiy although he denies getting involved with the broadcaster's editorial policies. In his address Zelensky's beaten rival praised his past achievements during own time in office saying among other things that it allowed creation of ""a large margin of safety"" for the impulse for change in Ukraine which will now be very hard to stagger. Poroshenko was destroyed by comedian-turned-politician Zelensky in the presidential election in April 2019 being only able to claim 24.5 percent of the vote in the second round. But despite the painful loss he hasn't quit politics taking the reins at the European Solidarity Party in hopes of returning to power. It turns out the two channels didn't drop Zelensky's address completely. They showed it to their audiences after midnight leaving them with two speeches and a feeling of déjà vu. Ironically Poroshenko's move seems to be a tit-for-tat response to his political rival as Zelensky got away with a similar stunt in December 2018. Back then 1+1 channel of oligarch Igor Kolomoysky broadcasted Zelensky's New Year address instead of the one by Poroshenko. In that clip the comedian announced that he was joining the presidential race. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

22,Appearing on Channel 4’s ‘The Last Leg’ on New Year’s Eve Jones was asked what she thought of the 16-year-old campaigner who was named Time Magazine’s ‘Person of the Year’ for 2019. “I think Greta’s amazing and what she’s doing is brilliant” the disabled comedian said. “But don’t do it now.” While the joke sent the studio audience into fits of laughter some viewers instantly took to Twitter to complain. “What example are we setting to young people making a change if we allow jokes like that to be aired?!” activist and BBC contributor Mandy Rose Jones opined. “Massive f**king yikes” declared another offended commenter deploying a catchphrase most often used by liberal complainers on Reddit. Another called Jones “one sick individual.” Amid scores of outraged comments some viewers chimed in to defend Jones. “Good on Rosie Jones” one wrote. “Given the scale of what both propose &amp; the societal upheaval (not excluding violence) that both advocate to bring it about no reason why Thunberg should be insulated from criticism interrogation &amp; mockery any more than radical Islam should.” Despite what the online outrage would suggest Jones’ gag was relatively tame as far as British comedy goes. Glaswegian funnyman Frankie Boyle for example has built a career on pushing boundaries entertaining sellout crowds with jokes about rape and pedophilia. Back in 2012 Boyle faced cries of ‘Ban this filth’ for joking that ‘Maddie’ the first name of missing child Madeleine McCann is an anagram of “I’m dead.” Boyle told his critics “you can’t argue with a joke – it’s like telling a clown their car won’t pass its MOT.” Like this story?

23,"Blue-and-yellow Ukrainian national flags mingled with the red-and-black banners of Bandera's Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and its armed wing the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) responsible for the mass murder and persecution during the last years of the Second World War in what is today western Ukraine. Carrying lit torches marchers chanted slogans such as ""Ukraine before everything"" ""Glory to Ukraine death to enemies"" and ""Glory to Ukraine glory to heroes!"" – the latter a WWII-era slogan of the OUN-UPA that came to be widely adopted since the 2014 coup first by the ultra-nationalists and then by the government and the military. The event in the capital featured some participants dressed up in period uniforms while others carried Bandera's photos as if they were icons in a church procession. The soundtrack to the menacing cortege was provided by a band of well-coordinated drummers. The musicians were sporting military-style uniforms and had their faces covered with balaclavas. The rally was agreed with the city authorities who deployed a large police force along its route.    Bandera's birthday January 1 has been a national holiday in Ukraine since 2019. He was born in 1909 in what was the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia (Galizien) at the time and became part of Poland after the First World War. While the OUN got its start agitating against Polish rule Bandera emerged as a leader of a hardline faction in 1940 hoping to establish an independent Ukrainian state with the help of Nazi Germany. Ukrainian nationalists point out that the Germans initially had no use for Bandera and the OUN placing him under house arrest in 1941 before sending him to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. However they did release Bandera in 1944 hoping that his UPA militants would help the Wehrmacht hold back the Soviet advance. Following the Allied victory the OUN-UPA switched sponsors from the defeated Nazis to the victorious Western Allies. Bandera moved to West Germany where he continued to agitate for ""free Ukraine"" at the dawn of the Cold War. He was killed in 1959 when a KGB assassin shot him with a cyanide-loaded dart. After Ukraine became independent in 1991 nationalists sought to establish Bandera as a national hero over the objections of Russia Poland and Israel. He was honored with the title of ""Hero of Ukraine"" by the Ukrainian government in 2010 – only for that title to be stripped by a court months later and by a new administration amid a vast international outcry.

24,Rolling out a list of “eerily prescient” predictions in order to brag about their accuracy – no flying cars here! – the National Intelligence Council (NIC) report is just what one might expect from an intel community desperate to shore up its reputation ahead of what’s sure to be a hotly contested presidential election. Intel vets have lamented that the intelligence community has become politicized to the point where it has affected their ability to accurately and objectively describe the reality in front of them – never mind the world 15 years in the future. The NIC paper may thus represent a lost art of apolitical prognostication a skill willingly sacrificed in the rush for modern spooks to prove themselves “team players.” After the near-fatal blow to its credibility dealt by the three-year Russiagate debacle US intelligence has a long way to go to build its reputation back.  But US intelligence has played enough of a role in crafting the world of 2020 that at least some of the report’s predictions have to be viewed as plans and suggestions rather than prognostication. Revelations about the CIA’s role in funding and training Al-Qaeda affiliates in Syria supplying weapons which often ended up in the hands of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists through Operation “Timber Sycamore” cast the report’s “fictional scenario” about “a new caliphate” whose adherents include Osama bin Laden's grandson in a more sinister light. Like IS the fictional caliphate described by the NIC inspires “non-practicing Muslims” from Europe and America to return to their ancestral homelands and take up arms against the “infidels”; also like IS they seize large swaths of territory in an Iraq weakened by years of war. With plans to regime-change “seven countries in five years” in the Middle East already underway in 2004 according to retired General Wesley Clark both imagined and real caliphate dovetailed nicely with US foreign policy aims of remaking the region in its image.  Meanwhile a scenario titled “Cycle of Fear” in which an “Orwellian world” arises from crippling fear of terrorism is almost a wink to the reader coming just a few short years after the September 11 attacks spawned the Patriot Act and a draconian reduction in Americans’ civil liberties. The NIC report was published years before NSA contractor Edward Snowden’s leaks began to reveal the disturbing extent of the US surveillance state and Americans in 2004 were for the most part blissfully ignorant about how much they were being spied on – but the NSA which consulted on the NIC paper certainly wasn’t. Other predictions are so obvious that holding them up as a sign of predictive genius is almost laughable. Anticipating a US confrontation with North Korea didn’t take any special skills – then-president George W. Bush had labeled the country part of the “Axis of Evil” alongside Iraq and Iran in 2002 presumably tagging it for eventual regime change. Nor did predicting China’s growth and dominance in the world economy require any great insight – it was already the second-largest global economy in 2004 with its GDP growing at over twice the rate of the US. And a warning against nation-building – a failure the US had already experienced in Afghanistan by 2004 – is hardly prescient; it simply hasn’t been heeded in the intervening 15 years. Sure the report nailed a shift in global alliances with rising economies like the BRICS countries increasingly making their presence felt on the geopolitical stage. But betting global alliances will shift within a 15-year timeframe isn't exactly clairvoyance. Unfortunately the NIC chose to end on an optimistic note coincidentally the least-likely scenario – a so-called “Pax Americana” in which Europe devastated by a series of terrorist attacks and “more unified than some of our American friends imagined” runs into the arms of the US “imploring America to get tough on terrorism.” Even looking beyond the name – “Pax” means “peace” something a nation with military bases in at least 80 countries knows little about – this hypothetical future has aged particularly badly in the era of Brexit encouraging other European countries to mull seeking independence from the union.  “Even as the existing order is threatened the United States will have many opportunities to fashion a new one” the report concludes. The stubborn optimism of the intelligence community of 2004 – just three years into what has become nearly two decades of non-stop war triggered in part by that community’s own intel failures – is much more “eerie” than any resemblance of its fortune-telling to the real world of 2020. It’s not hard to see how the slight disconnect with reality on display here mushroomed into the chasm separating today’s intelligence community from the real world. Like this story?

25,"Netanyahu submitted the request to Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein on Wednesday night stressing that he was not asking for ""everlasting immunity."" Earlier in a speech at Jerusalem's Orient Hotel Netanyahu clarified his intention to seek immunity saying it would only be “temporary” and last the duration of the next parliamentary session. “There is no possibility for anyone to avoid standing trial” he said. The PM added that he had never promoted or altered any law in an effort to avoid standing trial and that the immunity law exists to “protect elected officials from political lawsuits.” Netanyahu slammed the corruption charges against him as being politically motivated and pushed by people with “hidden motivations.” He said it was “very difficult” for his opponents and enemies to witness achievements under his leadership that made Israel the “eighth superpower in the world.” Netanyahu spent the remainder of his speech targeting political rivals including Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz. Neither Netanyahu or Gantz was able to form a government after elections last year. On Tuesday Israeli High Court judges rejected a petition filed by academics former defense officials and other public figures attempting to ban Netanyahu from seeking re-election due to the corruption charges leveled against him.  He is charged with bribery fraud and breach of public trust in three cases. Responding to Netanyahu's speech on Wednesday night Gantz said the PM's intention to seek immunity indicated that he was clearly guilty adding that Israel now faced a choice between “the Kingdom of Netanyahu… or the State of Israel.” Like this story?

26,The youths pounced on the officers dressed as Palestinian technicians hitting and pepper-spraying them after the men refused to give a clear explanation of why they were walking around the center of the West Bank settlement on Tuesday local media reported. They were subsequently taken in for questioning and their lawyer Moshe Polsky has claimed held overnight. The boys’ names were not released as they were both minors. Polsky defending the boys on behalf of right-wing legal aid group Honeinu slammed the officers for “committing provocations” during a “stressful security period.” The police declined to comment on the nature of their undercover work to the press and it’s easy to see how their presence might have raised a few eyebrows. Bat Ayin unlike many other Jewish settlements in the West Bank bars even Arab laborers from entry under a principle euphemistically called “Hebrew labor.” The attorney told a different version of events in which the disguised cops - along with other police hiding nearby - “jumped” the boys insisting the pepper-spray-wielding teen was forced to come to his friend’s aid only after he saw the other boy being attacked. Settlers are often heavily armed and anonymous residents told Arutz Sheva that the officers were lucky no armed inhabitant had passed by the confrontation. Settlement youth have been let off the hook for attacking police dressed as Palestinians before - the Jerusalem Magistrate’s Court absolved three teens from charges they had attacked disguised cops calling the officers’ actions “provocation.” Last month an unnamed security official highlighted a sharp uptick in settler violence against Palestinians near Bat Ayin over the preceding weeks telling the Times of Israel that the perpetrators were coming to the settlement from Yitzhar another recent hotspot for ethnically-motivated violence because of a military crackdown on the anti-Palestinian attacks in that area. In Bat Ayin last month two settlers were arrested for throwing rocks at a Palestinian vehicle and Palestinian bus driver was attacked while driving through the settlement in November.

27,Kurz and his Greens counterpart Werner Kogler announced on Wednesday that a deal had been done both seeming quite proud that they had been able to keep “key campaign promises.” “When you present the program you will see that both work – greening the tax system and reducing the tax burden” Kurz said vowing to “do everything to serve the Austrians.” “We agreed more on climate protection than we suspected” Kogler said explaining that “greening and social balance go hand in hand.” The deal still has to be approved by a majority of Greens delegates at the party’s Federal Congress on Saturday. If it passes the new government could assume power as soon as next week. The conservative People’s Party (OVP) leader entered into negotiations with the left-wing Greens in November two months after both parties made strong gains in September’s parliamentary elections. Kurz’s party was far and away the winner but their previous coalition partner – the far-right FPO – lost badly its reputation damaged after a manufactured scandal brought down its leader – and by extension the entire government – in May. The OVP and Greens had tried and failed to form a coalition before in 2003 and Kurz had warned that it would not be an easy task finding common ground between the conservative and liberal parties due to widely divergent stances on issues including immigration and economic policy. The OVP-FPO coalition government was dissolved in a vote of no confidence after a video appearing to show Kurz's FPO counterpart Heinz-Christian Strache engaging in corrupt dealings with the fake “niece” of a Russian oligarch in Ibiza in 2017 was mysteriously released just over a week before the European Parliament elections two years later. Strache has claimed the complicated scheme was designed by foreign intelligence agencies to torpedo the coalition and by extension the entire Euroskeptic right. Like this story?

28,Washington’s Route 240 was briefly shut down on Tuesday night due to the pileup which saw five cars and an 18-wheeler semi-truck buried under hundreds of tumbleweeds carried into the area by high winds. The roadway was closed down for several hours while Department of Transportation workers cleared away the piles. “People were still stuck at midnight and rang in the new year trapped under the weeds” Washington State Patrol trooper Chris Thorson told the Associated Press. Taking to Twitter with the hashtag #tumblegeddon on Wednesday morning Thorson shared footage of workers excavating the last remaining car from the mountain of weeds stuck there overnight – though “luckily no one was in it” the officer noted. The roads were finally cleared on New Year’s Day after some 10 hours of digging with workers employing snow plows to get the job done. While the bizarre roadblock surely put a damper on the holiday for those it held up the drivers all went on their way unharmed. Think your friends would be interested?

29,De Blasio called out the company in a tweet on Wednesday outraged about its New Year’s Eve prices for those celebrating the holiday in Times Square and encouraging New Yorkers to ditch the corporate franchise for local eateries. “Jacking up your prices on people trying to celebrate the holidays? Classy Domino's” he said. “To the thousands who came to Times Square last night to ring in 2020 I’m sorry this corporate chain exploited you – stick it to them by patronizing one of our fantastic LOCAL pizzerias.” The mayor’s broadside on Domino's was not received well on Twitter however where users piled on to demolish his “bad take” from all angles many observing that the $30 price tag is comparable to local pizza shops in Times Square. “Even at $30 its price competitive with full pies at any of those ‘local’ pizzerias near Times Square on a normal day and they have to pay delivery guys to run that pizza through a [crowd] on foot b/c people can't leave their position to go to a pizza place” one user shot back. Fox Business’s libertarian stalwart John Stossel also took a slice out of de Blasio slamming the mayor’s extravagant spending of city tax dollars while others sought to impart a lesson in basic economics. “Do you have any idea how much work/TIME it must be to find the person who ordered the pizza in that crowd?”asked YouTuber and one-time New York congressional candidate Joey Saladino. “Do you have any idea of the effect of your minimum wage increases? Do you know anything about business?” Like this story? Share it with a friend! , https://www.rt.com/usa/477293-de-blasio-schooled-pizza/,None
30,Some 13 people were on board a UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter when it attempted an emergency landing on Thursday morning Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said. Rescuers were promptly sent to the area of the crash in the mountainous Wulai district in the northern part of the Chinese self-governing territory. So far several people have been found alive while three including Shen remain unaccounted for. While it’s unclear what prompted the mishap the ministry reported that the aircraft was on a mission to Yilan County in northeastern Taiwan when it went down. The incident comes as the island gears up for its presidential and vice-presidential elections set for January 11. Speaking ahead of the ballot Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen who is seeking re-election in the upcoming vote stoked tensions in what is already a very tense relationship between the island and mainland China rejecting the “one country two systems” principle as something “definitely not feasible” for Taiwan. It comes after the territory’s parliament passed a so-called “anti-infiltration bill” championed by anti-Beijing forces and aimed at curbing the Chinese government’s influence.

31,Speaking in the context of the recently passed Citizenship Amendment Act which fast-tracks Indian citizenship for religious groups fleeing persecution in Afghanistan Pakistan and Bangladesh Reddy said India must pick up the slack for other nations unwilling to take in poor refugees singling out Italy by name. “It's our moral responsibility to give citizenship to the minorities [from three neighboring Muslim countries]” Reddy said. “If they don't come to India where will they go? To Italy?” The citizenship act has courted controversy and sparked nationwide protests with opponents arguing it discriminates against Muslims who were left off the list of groups eligible for expedited citizenship. Supporters of the bill have defended the exemption however arguing the three neighboring countries are predominately Muslim and that the bill is designed to protect vulnerable minorities. Since the Mediterranean migrant crisis broke out in the 2010s Italy has been among the least willing to open its doors to refugees many of whom are fleeing violence and various forms of persecution in Africa. During his tenure in office the country’s recently replaced Interior Minister Matteo Salvini – who also heads up the right-populist Lega Nord party – helped to drive an anti-immigration policy agenda. In 2018 a measure dubbed the “Salvini decree” was signed into law scrapping a number of legal protections for migrants and streamlining the deportation process. Though the decree and other similar acts appear to have had some effect – with Italy taking in about half the number of refugees in 2019 that it did in the previous year – Salvini’s replacement Luciana Lamorgese has indicated a much less hawkish stance on the migrant question. In an interview with La Repubblica in November she denied that Italy was “facing any invasion” – a term Salvini and like-minded lawmakers have used to describe the large influx of refugees into Europe.

32,Some 16 of the drones have been seen across northeast Colorado in recent weeks sheriff's departments in two Colorado counties have confirmed. Though the aircraft have not violated any federal guidelines for flying Yuma County Sheriff Todd Combs said they’ve nonetheless left residents “very nervous and anxious.” “People do not like the unknown as it upsets the balance of our lives” Combs wrote in a lengthy Facebook post on Tuesday noting that there were “many theories about what is going on” but no definitive explanation. “I think we are all feeling a little bit vulnerable due to the intrusion of our privacy that we enjoy in our rural community but I don't have a solution or know of one right now. All I can say is don't live your life in the fear of the unknown” the sheriff continued. Most of the drones – unarmed and generally non-threatening – have been seen flying in low-altitude “Class G” airspace which under federal regulations gives a wide berth for small private aircraft to “operate as they see fit” Combs said. Both the FAA and the US Army also deny that the craft are theirs according to the Denver Post though the Pentagon and Air Force did not respond to a request for comment. Beyond that little else is known. Several divisions of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are now looking into the drones seen flying over both states FAA spokesman Ian Gregor told CNN. An FAA investigator is also scheduled to meet with Combs’ department next week to get to the bottom of the mystery. Colorado Senator Cory Gardner also said he was keeping watch over the situation tweeting on Tuesday that he had been in contact with FAA officials. In the meantime Combs said: “I would like to reassure you I am doing the best to get you answers” also warning residents to refrain from attempting to shoot down the craft while they investigate. Some have taken to Twitter to suggest ways to bring the drones down but authorities warn their batteries could ignite fires on the ground. The strange phenomenon comes as the FAA seeks to introduce a new rule requiring most drones to be equipped with remote ID technology which the agency says will “enhance safety and security by allowing the FAA law enforcement and Federal security agencies to identify drones flying in their jurisdiction.” A fairly new but rapidly developing technology there are now some 1.5 million drones and around 160000 remote pilots registered with the FAA.

37,At least 18 people have died throughout the current bushfire season in Australia. Eight of the victims perished in the country’s southeast on New Year's Eve while 17 people remain unaccounted-for in Victoria State.  New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian has declared a seven-day state of emergency and the fire service have created a roughly 200km-long “tourist leave zone.” “We don’t take these decisions lightly but we also want to make sure we’re taking every single precaution to be prepared for what could be a horrible day on Saturday” Berejiklian said. Another heatwave is expected to hit the beleaguered country at the weekend with gusting winds and temperatures expected to hit 40 degrees Celsius in parts. These conditions have prompted the urgent need to evacuate the roughly 3000 tourists and 1000 locals stuck in Mallacoota Victoria. The 1000-person capacity ship HMAS Choules is anchored about 1.5 kilometres off Mallacoota Thursday morning and will set sail for an undisclosed Victorian port on Friday morning with an estimated 800 evacuees on board. “We’re looking to put 1000 on the ship. If the number is less than 1000 then clearly everyone is going to go in that first boat” HMAS Choules' Commander Scott Houlihan said.  “If the number is greater than 1000 then it’s going to be a second load. It’s 16-17 hours to the closest boat port then we’ve got to come back.” The multi-role aviation training vessel MV Sycamore will also assist in the relief operation in what New South Wales’ Transport Minister Andrew Constance called the “largest evacuation of people out of the region ever.” Weather permitting evacuations will also be carried out by air if and when the thick acrid smoke clears; children the sick and elderly will be given priority. This season’s bushfires have scorched over 5.5 million hectares (13.5 million acres) across the country greater than the land mass of Denmark or the Netherlands and the impending heatwave looks set to exacerbate an already dire situation. “The message is we’ve got so much fire in that area we have no capacity to contain these fires” New South Wales Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said.

38,CNEOS is tasked with watching the skies for any potentially hazardous asteroids but given the vastness of space that’s a lot of sky to check which may explain why two of the four asteroids were only spotted yesterday.  2020 AC with a diameter of roughly 89 feet and traveling at approximately 13000 miles per hour will lead the charge flying past the Earth at 1:56 am EST.  It will be followed soon after by the 72-foot-wide 2020AD which is traveling at a blistering 35000 miles per hour and will buzz the earth at 4:12 am EST. 2019 YH2 the largest in the group measuring an estimated 459 feet in diameter and traveling at 32000 miles per hour is expected to pass by at 4:36 am EST.  Bringing up the rear will be 2019 AE3 measuring roughly 72 feet and traveling at over 18000 miles per hour will fly past us at 9:08 am EST.  2020 AD and 2019 YH2 are classified as Apollo asteroids with very wide orbits while 2020 AC and 2019 AE3 are Aten asteroids meaning their semi-major axis is smaller than Earth's. 2020 AD will come the closest to us passing at a distance of just 556000 miles (for reference the moon is 238855 miles away). 2019 YH2 on the other hand will pass us at a distance of about 1.8 million miles. So thankfully 2020 won’t be kicking off with that big of a bang but there is still cause for concern that we don’t know when the next asteroid might be coming right for us. Like this story?

39,Seven people including four pilots have been detained after the Interior Ministry launched a probe into the allegations that the fugitive ex-CEO had made it from Osaka to Beirut Lebanon passing through Istanbul Turkish media said on Thursday. A former chairman and CEO of Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance Ghosn is charged in Japan with embezzling the company's assets and lying to shareholders about the size of his salary. He fled the country days ago after being put under house arrest. Many details of Ghosn's sudden escape are still unclear but it is believed he traveled to Lebanon on a private jet and a private security company may have been involved in getting him out of Japan. A Brazilian native of Lebanese origin Ghosn has citizenship of Brazil France and Lebanon. There were conflicting reports about which passports were in his possession during his escape. According to NHK Ghosn managed to board a flight with a spare French passport. The businessman denies all allegations against him. Upon landing in Lebanon which does not have an extradition treaty with Japan Ghosn said he has no faith in the “rigged Japanese justice system” and accused the authorities in Tokyo of not respecting his rights.   French State Secretary for Economy and Finance Agnes Pannier-Runacher told BFM TV that Paris would not have extradited Ghosn if he had arrived in the country because “France never extradites its nationals.” Think your friends would be interested?

41,The thought of going back to work after a festive season dominated by too much food drink and average films on TV can be unappetizing for many around the world but Brits seem to have taken it to another level going by their social media feeds. #backtowork was trending on Twitter on Thursday with an avalanche of humorous gifs and memes as workers in the UK expressed their horror at having to function at the start of 2020. One seemingly dazed and confused person tweeted an apology for being late to work insisting that “I got up on time had a shower and then accidentally sat down on my bed and stared into space for 30 minutes.”  Gifs showing a disgruntled child and a perplexed former US President Barack Obama were also in supply as well as funny memes illustrating helpful guides to what to expect on their first day back in the workplace. There were even poems penned such as one called ‘New Year Office Chit-chat.’ It comes after new research revealed people suffering from ‘back-to-work’ stress may be suffering from alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Dr Mark Wright a consultant in liver medicine at University Hospital Southampton (UHS) warned that many will put feelings of nausea shaking and general irritability down to “work dread” as the festive season comes to an end. While many across the UK were struggling to ease back into the daily grind on Thursday people in Scotland were relishing yet another public holiday.  Think your friends would be interested?

42,In a subversive twist on normality the British Army is making use of this modern social mindset for a new recruitment campaign to get such stereotypes “to join its ranks.” The campaign is being rolled out this week on Twitter Facebook and mainstream media. In one of the ads aimed at young women the image shows a jigsaw of toned physiques and implies that make-up fake tan and lip fillers only present a temporary fix to gain confidence. Critics online however question the authenticity of the ad and ask if promoting the army to the ‘body beautiful’ and potentially vacuous snowflake generation is the best way to gain army recruits. Nick Terry who works for Capita developed the ‘Army Confidence Lasts A Lifetime’ recruitment campaign and said the creatives devised the ad for young people who normally wouldn’t “see the army as their first port of call.” He added: “The recruitment campaign evolves each year and we are looking to build on the success of last year where applications reached a five-year high and 1.5 million people visited the recruitment website in January alone. We had to go with a slightly different message. They needed a bit more persuading and convincing that the army was right for them.” According to research conducted by The Prince’s Trust and Deloitte 54 per cent of 16-to-24-year-olds lack self-esteem and 46 per cent feel inadequate. So is joining the military one way to combat the zeitgeist epidemic of body-dysmorphia-meets-social-media shallowness? The British army is currently facing a long-term decline in numbers with almost 8500 vacant positions. But do those who support an ego-centric lifestyle have the country’s best interest at heart? Defence Secretary Ben Wallace believes that a career in the army can be an ideal step for many young people: “The latest Army recruitment campaign reflects these unique opportunities and I hope it will build on the success of last year’s campaign which led to a record number of applications in recent years.” Whether becoming soldiers will give selfie lovers a narrative is debatable but for those simply wanting to lose weight and get fitter senior officers have also revealed that the army will be running a four-week boot camp for those who fail to meet the selection guidelines. Let’s hope every army-worthy snowflake’s dry January and radical new diets for 2020 are doing well. Think your friends would be interested?

43,Pope Francis would clearly have rathered a different end to 2019 but was instead embroiled in a controversy albeit minor on December 31 when he appeared to slap away a rather overly enthusiastic fan something for which he later apologized. Salvini posted his own parody version of the incident on his social media channels which has been viewed over 600000 on Instagram alone.  The former Italian minister of the interior appears walking nonchalantly before being accosted by an adoring but “agitated fan” (his girlfriend Francesca Verdini). He draws back as if to strike her before gently caressing her cheek instead as the pair burst out laughing. Without mentioning Francis by name Salvini was clearly making light of the much-discussed incident in St Peter’s Square.  “So many times we lose patience. It happens to me too. I apologize for the bad example given yesterday” the Pope said before giving his traditional prayer from the Apostolic Palace in the iconic Vatican square. Like this story?

44,"Lawmakers approved the motion which grants a one-year mandate for the troop deployment in an emergency session on Thursday. The motion passed by 325 votes to 184. The plan was opposed by Turkey's main opposition party the Republican Peoples’ Party (CHP) which said sending troops could aggravate the situation and embroil Ankara in another conflict. The CHP said Monday that it didn't want to see a situation similar to the crisis in Syria ""unfold in yet another country."" The motion does not clarify how big the deployment would be or when troops would be sent allowing for the government to decide on the details. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said Wednesday that the deployment would likely start with military advisers drones and special operations and that the ""hope"" would be that the military itself would not need to be involved. Oktay said Turkey would not need to send troops if the rival government led by Gen Khalifa Haftar halted its offensive and had a ""different attitude."" Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in December that Libyan prime minister Fayez al-Sarraj had asked for Ankara to send troops to the war-torn country when the two signed a military support pact. He insisted the deployment will allow Turkey to safeguard its interests in Libya and the wider region. Less than an hour after the adoption of the bill the Turkish president's office said Erdogan discussed Libya with his US counterpart Donald Trump. The two leaders “stressed the importance of diplomacy in resolving regional issues” yet it remained unclear whether Washington endorsed Ankara’s decision or opposed it. Egypt for its part made its position very clear condemning Turkey’s move and warning that it might “negatively affect the stability of the Mediterranean region.” Cairo has also urged the international community to address Ankara’s endeavor as soon as possible. Libya has been locked in a never-ending civil conflict since 2011 when NATO’s bombing campaign helped anti-government militants to oust the long-time leader of the country Muammar Gaddafi. The international intervention helped the “democratic” uprising to succeed – Gaddafi was gruesomely murdered and the country was effectively destroyed as a state. As of now there are two main warring parties in Libya – the UN-backed Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) and the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR) propped by the so-called Libyan National Army (LNA) led by strongman Khalifa Haftar. The two forces have been entangled in a bloody conflict for years already yet the standoff became particularly heated early in 2019 when the LNA launched a massive assault against the GNA and reached the outskirts of Tripoli. The offensive however promptly lost its momentum resulting in a stalemate – but in mid-December Haftar announced a new push on Tripoli and intense fighting resumed.

45,Thursday’s strike action saw protesters block two bus depots in Paris. Officers dispatched to the protest were filmed spraying what some described as tear gas directly into the faces of some of the demonstrators.   Tear gas was also reportedly used by police on the streets of the city center where protesters marched on Thursday some bearing brightly-burning flares and there were several arrests as riot police and demonstrators clashed.  Unions began protesting against the pension reform proposals on December 5 2019 and warned the strikes which have seriously impacted on the country’s transport services would continue into the new year unless the Macron government took their concerns about the pension system changes on board. The previous record for the longest continuous strike in France was 28 days set by rail workers in 1968. Think your friends would be interested?

46,The court ruled in favor of Puigdemont and another pro-independence politician Toni Comin who served as health minister in the exiled leader’s former government. Both politicians are now residing in Belgium and are wanted in Spain on charges of sedition over their role in organizing a banned Catalonia independence referendum in 2017. The two were still elected to the European Parliament in May as representatives of the Catalan parties. In late December the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that Puigdemont and Comin should be allowed to sit as MEPs and that Madrid had no right to block them. Just days after the ruling Madrid prosecutors asked a Spanish judge to maintain the international arrest warrants for both politicians. In his latest tweet Puigdemont called for the release of another pro-independence leader Oriol Junqueras who was sentenced to 13 years in jail for his role in the attempted secession. “Spain must act in the same way as Belgium has done and respect the law” the former Catalan president said pointing to the fact that Junqueras was an MEP as well. Catalan independence remains a hot topic in the region more than two years after the referendum was shut down by a heavy-handed police operation. Both secessionists and unionists have repeatedly hit the streets in massive demonstrations throughout the region ever since. Most recently thousands of protesters demanding self-determination and the release of imprisoned Catalan leaders took to the streets of Barcelona following a highly anticipated El Clasico match in La Liga on December 18. The protest ended up in clashes between the demonstrators and riot police. Think your friends would be interested?

47,Two large glowing orbs appeared to be flanking the Sun on either side dwarfing our star in the process on the last day of 2019 in the skies above the country’s northeastern Jilin Province. These “artificial suns” hung in the sky for roughly 20 minutes before disappearing. Now given that the Sun provides plenty of light and heat for our planet on its own how could it be that we didn’t all burn up in a fiery apocalypse if two additional suns suddenly burst into the sky? It turns out the ‘extra’ suns were actually caused by an atmospheric optical phenomenon known as a sun dog formally referred to as a parhelion. A sun dog is caused by the refraction of sunlight by ice crystals in Earth’s atmosphere which usually create glowing orbs in the sky roughly 22 degrees to left and right of the sun at the same altitude above the horizon.  The temperature needs to be quite cold roughly 20 degrees below zero Celsius when the Sun is still quite low in the sky for the spectacular if mildly terrifying phenomenon to occur.

48,The controversial presentation took place in early December when the primary school in Labunia was bestowed with the honorary title of the Children of the Zamosc. The name refers to thousands of Polish children who had been rounded up and deported by the occupying Nazi forces as part of an ethnic-cleansing campaign. Zamosc the city northwest of the Labunia commune was the focus of the mass deportations and became the namesake for the tragedy. To mark the honor bestowed on it the school held a ceremony inviting various officials surviving veterans serving members of the military and police force and other guests. School students some of them as young as seven gave a dance performance in a symbolic re-enactment of what happened during the Second World War. Details of the Zamosc presentation became national news and a scandal after they were reported by the Polish edition of Newsweek magazine. Critics say the school had gone too far when it decided to dress young kids in the uniforms of the brutal Nazi secret police (the Gestapo which had been in charge of the wartime operation) and death-camp robes and to even stage what appears to be a mass execution. Among the voices blasting the scenography was that of the Auschwitz memorial which said there were better ways to educate young children about the horrors of the Nazi crimes. “The adults who organized this lack in elementary sensitivity” it said in a tweet. Some 232000 children were murdered at the Auschwitz death camp including about 3000 ethnic Poles. Part of the anger is probably directed not at the poor artistic taste but rather the speeches that were delivered during the naming ceremony. According to Newsweek some of the speakers told children that Poland was still owed reparations from Germany while the head of Labunia warned them that left-wing politicians wanted to eradicate God from the national culture. A Polish NGO apparently was so offended that it intends to file a complaint about public incitement of violence against leftists. Facing the criticism the school has since deleted photos of the performance from its webpage. Footage and pictures are still widely available in the Polish media however.

49,"The ‘red’ notice calls on authorities in Lebanon to arrest Ghosn who managed to jump bail in Japan where he is charged with embezzlement and to flee to the middle-eastern country.  Interpol’s request was received by Lebanon’s internal security forces but it has yet to be referred to the judiciary a Lebanese judicial source told Reuters. The source told the news agency that in past cases where Lebanon has received red notices for Lebanese citizens resident in the country the suspects were not been detained but their passports were confiscated and a bail bond set. Ghosn fled Japan days ago by hiding in the case of a musical instrument after having been put under house arrest in that country.  Many details of his daring escape remain unclear but it is believed he traveled to Lebanon on a private jet and a private security company may have been involved in getting him out of Japan.

50,PM Scott Morrison visited the town of Cobargo on Thursday apparently looking for a PR opportunity – that actually turned into a disaster for him. The fires devastated the township on Tuesday – at least three people were killed while scores lost their homes and businesses. READ MORE: Australian air force navy preparing for ‘largest ever evacuation' of people from fire-ravaged Victoria (PHOTOS VIDEOS) The official started his visit to Cobargo walking up to a local woman casually asking “How are you?” and then forcing her into a handshake – and that was when all the PR stunt flopped. “I’m only shaking your hand if you give more funding to our RFS [Rural Fire Service]” the visibly reluctant woman told the PM. Morrison was promptly swarmed by locals afterwards who asked him a bunch of quite reasonable questions about very low number of fire engines that responded to the fires lack of relief and so on – that he did not answer however. The PM aimlessly roamed the street with a bunch of other officials including the natural disasters minister David Littleproud – and their silence only angered the locals further. One man urged the official to get out of town telling him that his electoral prospects now look quite bleak in a profanity-laden rant. “You’re an idiot mate. You really are. You won’t be getting any votes down here buddy… No liberal votes. You’re out son. You are out. Goodnight Vienna. Bye. Go on p**s off.” Pelted with further questions about those who died in the fires and the many who've lost their homes the officials ultimately retreated to their car – without so much as a goodbye. Australia has been plagued by the bushfires that affected each of its states since the end of October. Extreme heat and high winds make the situation even more complicated with new blazes sparking almost daily. So far the fires have devastated more than four million hectares (10 million acres) of land. , https://www.rt.com/news/477325-australia-pm-bushfire-victims/,None
51,A petition signed by 67 former government officials asked the court to rule that Netanyahu would not be fit for forming a new government due to his being prosecuted. The court ruled that it indeed had the power to rule on the matter contrary to claims from the Likud party’s lawyers but refused to do so before the outcome of the election is clear. It clears the way for Netanyahu to run in the snap election but his theoretical premiership remains in question. The court pointed out that even if Likud wins the mandate to form the next Israeli government its incumbent leader may not be the person who would be tasked with the job. Netanyahu is currently seeking immunity from prosecution which may be given him by the Knesset. However even some of his allies in the previous snap election said they were not willing to grant this to him. Like this story?

52,"Esper said he expects more “provocative behavior” by “Iran-backed” groups – and warned that “they will likely regret it.” “They’ve been…attacking our bases for months now” Esper claimed apparently pinning every rocket attack on a coalition base in recent months on Iran. He called on Iraq to “do more…to address these Iran-sponsored militia groups and to stop their attacks on US and coalition forces” complaining the US has not “seen sufficient action on that front” from Baghdad. The Trump administration blamed Tuesday’s siege of the US embassy in Baghdad on Tehran and sent 750 troops to Iraq in order to beef up security at the diplomatic compound. Iran President Donald Trump has said will be held ""fully responsible for lives lost or damage incurred at any of our facilities."" However the protesters who surrounded the embassy were motivated by rage over US strikes that killed 25 members of Kataib Hezbollah part of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) and officially part of the Iraqi military. Tehran meanwhile has accused the US of punishing it for defeating Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists. It slammed the “audacity” of Washington fobbing responsibility for the protests off on Iran when US airstrikes – supposedly in response for an attack on a coalition base near Kirkuk – had actually motivated the embassy-storming. The Trump administration’s rhetoric regarding Iran may trigger deja vu for those who remember the most recent Iraq War with its talk of pre-emptive strikes against leader Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi leader was said to be sitting on a cache of weapons of mass destruction and had to be stopped before he could use them. Now known to be a complete fiction the “weapons of mass destruction” trope has been recycled in the Trump administration’s sanctions on Iran deeming the country’s largest airline a “weapons of mass destruction proliferator.”  The US could send still more forces to the Middle East Esper said pledging to “take it day by day.”“A variety of forces” are standing by in case they are needed Joint Staff General Mark Milley said.

53,Shaun Sawyer chief constable of Devon and Cornwall Police and the UK lead on slavery and human trafficking said drug gangs exploit the space between “the school gate and the front door” which he described as a vacuum left in the wake of government cuts for child services and increased austerity measures under the Conservative government.  “More police officers will make a dent but it won’t stop the causes. One of the solutions to the causes is the gap between the dysfunctional home and the school” Sawyer said.  The UK has seen a 74 percent rise in exploitation of majority-British-national children reaching some 726 people in 2019. At least 638 children under 18 claimed to have suffered criminal exploitation in three months mostly related to the illegal drug trade which uses children as drug mules and debt collectors especially in smaller rural communities far from their own homes.  There were a reported 1739 live modern slavery operations in Britain encompassing figures for both children and adults compared with a reported 180 operations in January 2016.  “For these children they are almost back to Victorian times and are being criminally exploited. These kids are looking for family and security” Sawyer added decrying the sharp increase in the number of child grooming victims over the last five years and citing a lack of youth facilities and school exclusions.  There were approximately 18700 suspected child grooming victims in 2018-19 up from some 3300 just five years ago.  “For understandable reasons of austerity state youth services have been vacated. This gap of youth provision between the school and family is the void that the exploiters are filling.” Sawyer also warned against gender bias in law enforcement and urged seeing boys as victims of the same exploitation.  “We accept that a 14-year-old girl does not make a choice to sleep with multiple men. I don’t think it is an informed choice to choose repeatedly to steal or deal drugs and then hand over the profits” Sawyer concluded. “We’ve learned that girls who are exploited can be victims but we seem unable or unwilling to learn the same lessons for boys where criminal exploitation is concerned.” Think your friends would be interested?

54,Castro released a video on Thursday thanking his supporters and promising to “keep fighting for an America where everyone counts.” Touting his record of “speaking up for the most vulnerable folks in this country” the former San Antonio mayor boasted of “shaping the conversation” in the 2020 race but admitted that he had realized “it simply isn’t our time” with just a month to go before the caucuses in Iowa. Castro made waves by promising on the debate stage to decriminalize illegal border crossings leading many other candidates to adopt that position – unpopular as it may be among voters. A third-generation immigrant he entered the presidential race almost exactly a year ago holding up his success – first mayor of a large Texas city then secretary of Housing and Urban Development under then-President Barack Obama – as proof of “what is possible when this country gets it right.” However he was not able to distinguish himself in fundraising or poll numbers struggling to crack one percent for most of the race (though some polls put him as high as 4 percent). He nearly ended his campaign in October getting in just under the wire with the $800000 his campaign needed to go forward. Castro has blamed the primary schedule in which largely-white states like Iowa and New Hampshire vote first for potentially skewing results claiming they do not represent the country’s true demographics. Castro’s departure leaves the still-crowded Democratic field with 14 candidates with another 12 – many of whom voters would not even recognize – having dropped out. Some have speculated that Castro who reportedly made the shortlist to be Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential pick in 2016 could end up back in the race as another candidate’s VP.

55,Speaking at a rally on Thursday the leader did not mince his words for the opposition or for his country’s ach-rival Pakistan and vigorously defended the new law. Modi flatly accused India’s main opposition party –the Indian National Congress (INC)– of attacking the country’s legislature and vulnerable refugees urging it to find a target for criticism elsewhere. “Pakistan was formed on the basis of religion and minorities were being persecuted there. The persecuted were forced to come to India as refugees. But [the INC] and its allies don’t speak against Pakistan instead they are taking out rallies against these refugees” Modi said. The new law in India officially known as the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) has been among the hottest issues in the country over the past few weeks. The legislation facilitates accession to Indian citizenship for the people who immigrated into the country from the three neighboring Muslim-majority states – Pakistan Afghanistan and Bangladesh – fleeing alleged religious persecution. The simplified procedure however does not extend to Muslim migrants from these countries. The CAA’s critics claimed that the legislation is discriminatory and “anti-Muslim” in its essence. Its adoption sparked mass protests across the country bringing both India’s Muslims and critics of the Modi government’s policies onto the streets. The handling of the protests by the authorities has somewhat fueled the unrest further – a massive police raid on New Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia University’s campus for instance stirred up students’ dissent countrywide. The law also drew some international criticism with Pakistan being particularly vocal about it. The country’s top officials including PM Imran Khan condemned the policies of New Delhi warning that adoption of the CAA – as well as India’s handling of the disputed region of Kashmir – might cause a mass exodus of Muslims creating a new refugee crisis that the world hasn’t witnessed before. Meanwhile Modi has said he is perplexed as to how the law designed to help vulnerable groups of people could be so blatantly misinterpreted as discriminatory. Think your friends would be interested?

56,"Box-ticking is a number one priority for Marvel’s upcoming Phase Four films. Having already confirmed gay and deaf characters in ‘The Eternals’ Marvel President Kevin Feige promised that a transgender character will be introduced into the fictional world “very soon.” Asked at the New York Film Academy about transgender representation in the franchise that kicked off in 2008 with ‘Iron Man’ Feige responded that a film “shooting right now” would feature a transgender character. This would suggest that ‘The Eternals’ due out in November is the film in question since it is currently being filmed.  However there have also been reports that Marvel is seeking to cast a transgender actor in ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’ which is set to be released next year. ‘The Eternals’ follows a group of immortal creatures who live on Earth and help to shape civilizations. It will star actors like Angelina Jolie and Kit Harrington. Feige has already confirmed a gay character will be included in the film. “He’s married he’s got a family and that is just part of who he is” Feige told ‘Good Morning America’ about the character. While there’s absolutely nothing wrong with having transgender or gay characters in stories having those labels be the starting point and central driving force for characters is not sitting well with the non-‘woke’ crowds out there.  “I'm a Big BIG fan of [Marvel] - the comics and the movies - but it's this s**t which has caused the slump in comic sales and this WILL cause an end to their movies being hits!” wrote one Twitter user in reaction. “This will bomb worse than ‘Cats'’’ wrote another. Meanwhile others have criticized the studio from the opposite end by saying that Marvel is not going woke enough. They have speculated that the characters Feige is touting will be nonessential to the plot. This criticism is likely based on the fact that director JJ Abrams bragged about having gay representation in ‘The Rise of Skywalker’ only to have the representation end up being a kiss in a mass celebration scene. Far from the gay love story between main characters Poe and Finn that actor Oscar Isaac wanted. “I am so sick of Marvel and Disney and fake representation of LGBT characters"" one Twitter user wrote. ""This will be a background character that appears for 5 seconds and is easily cut out of the movie.

57,Several early risers walking on beaches in the city of Fort Pierce were stunned to see an unexplained object streak across the sky in the moments before sunrise on Wednesday. As well as a fiery trail the peculiar object also left a raft of questions in its wake as eyewitnesses struggled to comprehend what they had seen. “I knew what I was looking at was either a missile or a rocket” witness John Simard told local news outlet WPTV. “What I couldn’t understand was why was I seeing it in that area because there’s no launchpads out in the ocean.” Simard who was at the beach to photograph the first sunrise of the new year shared footage of the strange occurrence on Facebook asking his followers if they had ever seen a rocket that wasn’t moving? “If that’s a rocket it’s the world’s slowest moving rocket. It’s a dang UFO is what it is” he said. However Sanford Manley a former historian with the US Strategic Air Command poured cold water on Simard’s theory claiming that what people actually saw was the contrail of a plane being illuminated by the rising sun. “The plane is very high catching the sunlight before the sun has come up therefore it's glowing red” Manley said. He explained that the phenomenon typically occurs more often during sunsets than sunrises. After Simard appeared on local news stations his daughter Melissa Krystal Simard said that Facebook is “fact checking” his photos.  “We think the government is on to him” she joked. “Shit is crazy!

58,The Delhi Metro is a massive urban transport system spanning 325 kilometers and linking the Indian capital to its satellite towns. The sheer size of the transport network used by almost three million commuters every day sets it firmly among the largest metro systems in the world including those in London Shanghai Beijing and New York. Now with the help of Russian telecoms expertise the city’s underground network has also joined the ranks of metro systems offering free Wi-Fi to its passengers. It’s on just one line so far the link from the city’s commercial district to Indira Gandhi International Airport. The Wi-Fi service the first of its kind in south Asia was launched on Thursday by Delhi Metro Managing Director Mangu Singh. Russian firm MaximaTelecom was the project’s primary contractor and technology provider although the internet facilities themselves were built by a number of Indian companies. MaximaTelecom has notable experience in developing such networks having already built similar Wi-Fi systems for both the Moscow and St Petersburg metros.

59,Clinton said it was a “great privilege” to become the university’s 11th chancellor after her appointment was announced on Thursday. While the position does not involve relocating to Belfast – sorry Americans – the chancellor acts as an ambassador outside Northern Ireland and sometimes oversees graduation ceremonies in addition to advising the vice-chancellor and senior management.  The two-time presidential candidate received an honorary degree from the school in 2018 and has something of a history with Northern Ireland visiting with then-president Bill Clinton when he became the first serving US leader to travel there in 1995 and returning many times over the intervening years. The Clintons also have a home in the Republic of Ireland. Many on social media seemed to think she would be moving to Belfast to assume the five-year position and (erroneously) celebrated. Others wondered at the effect she would have on the students and the region which is part of the United Kingdom. A few grumbled that she still hasn’t paid for her crimes despite the chant of “lock her up” popular at Trump campaign rallies. Meanwhile Clinton supporters gloated and referenced the ill-fated Trump University – as if Clinton had had any role in founding or funding Queen’s. Clinton claims to be facing “enormous pressure” to enter the 2020 presidential race with her supporters envisioning it as a rematch against President Donald Trump. Since losing in 2016 Clinton has spent most of her media appearances attempting to delegitimize her opponent blaming his victory on everything from Russia to former FBI Director James Comey to her Democratic primary opponent Bernie Sanders who is running again in 2020. Clinton’s university position is not expected to impede a third presidential run that many including former Trump campaign director Steve Bannon believe is imminent.

61,"The new year barely begun President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fast-tracked a motion to approve the potential deployment of Turkish troops which passed handily in parliament on Thursday.  Erdogan’s move follows a pattern of recent muscle-flexing and is an obvious play to force Ankara into a more influential position. This is a gamble that could backfire. Ravaged by years of conflict perhaps the last thing Libya needs is another foreign power sending its troops into an already desperate situation – but Erdogan hasn’t hidden his desire to make Turkey a “top ten” world power and if it takes a military campaign in North Africa to do it perhaps he thinks it’s worth the risks. The vote to clear the way for a deployment of troops follows a military cooperation deal signed in November between Ankara and the UN-recognized government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. Sarraj has been locked in a bloody civil war with the rival government of General Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army to the east – the debacle is a direct result of NATO’s 2011 ‘humanitarian’ intervention which saw Western powers back anti-government militants in ousting and murdering PM Muammar Gaddafi leaving the country ripe for plunder and with a power vacuum needing to be filled. Yet Erdogan is putting all his eggs in one basket with Libya hoping that if Sarraj’s government in Tripoli eventually wins the civil war (and he seems to believe Turkey can help tip the balance there) Ankara will be rewarded with extended influence in the Mediterranean.  The tricky thing for Ankara is that with its oversized ambitions it threatens to alienate itself from its burgeoning relationship with Moscow – recently strengthened by the purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defense systems much to the annoyance of Ankara’s NATO partners. Russia which has been reticent about side-taking in Libya and calling for dialogue said last week it was “unlikely” that interference from third parties in Libya would lead to a settlement.  This all at a time when Erdogan has few solid friends to turn to as his relationship with Washington teeters on rocky ground following Turkey’s sudden October incursion into northern Syria against the Kurds (a move which the US was most decidedly“not happy” with). It’s not just Russia and the US who Ankara will be irking with this latest power play either. Erdogan’s deal with Sarraj which also aims to create an exclusive economic zone from southern Turkey to Libya's north east also angered Cyprus and Greece who complain that it violates the international law of the sea.  Erdogan has long harbored grand ambitions for Turkey repeating regularly that the world is “bigger than five” – a reference to the five members of the UN Security Council. The Libya crisis is seen as an opportunity by which he can force Turkey into the club (or at least be taken more seriously by it) – but he’s not the only outside player in the game. Haftar reportedly promised last week that his LNA forces would take Tripoli ""in hours"" if Egypt sent troops to help. With Haftar already receiving material support from France Egypt Jordan the United Arab Emirates (and allegedly from Russia too) Erdogan may get himself in over his head and find Turkey increasingly isolated. In his Libya gamble the risks may be greater than the rewards. Like this story? Share it with a friend! ", https://www.rt.com/news/477343-turkey-libya-erdogan-imperial-ambitions/,None
62,During the phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday “President Trump pointed out that foreign interference is complicating the situation in Libya” the White House said in a statement.  No further details were given but the call took place just after the Turkish legislature voted 325 to 184 to approve sending troops to the North African country  in order to prop up Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj and his Government of National Accord (GNA). Though the GNA is the internationally recognized government of Libya most of the country is actually controlled by a rival government in Tobruk and troops of the Libyan National Army (LNA) loyal to General Khalifa Haftar. The GNA has been reduced to the area around the capital Tripoli which the LNA has sought to capture since April 2019. Readout of the call given by Erdogan’s cabinet merely said the two leaders had “stressed the importance of diplomacy in resolving regional issues” without making it clear whether Washington endorsed Ankara’s decision or opposed it. Erdogan’s bid to back Tripoli against Tobruk resembles his power play in northern Syria in October in that it is apparently unilateral and neither coordinated nor cleared with its NATO allies. One major distinction is that the Syrian incursion was aimed against the legitimate government in Damascus as well as the US-backed Kurdish militias.  Trump advising against “foreign interference” is of course ironic on a whole different scale given the US assertion of a free hand to intervene anywhere anytime against anyone – from illegally keeping troops in Iraq and Syria to launching a regime-change operation in Libya itself back in 2011. At the time NATO bombers provided cover for militants to overthrow the government of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and plunge Libya into a chaos from which it has yet to recover.

63,The network coined the euphemism “civic sparring” to describe the often-heated conflicts that take place in the suburbs of New York City when Hasidic Jewish communities – often insular with large numbers of children and wary of outsiders – begin expanding sometimes at the expense of families already living in the area who may lose control of local government and schools. NBC didn’t stop at coining the cringeworthy term however. It suggested “some fear the recent violence” – a mass stabbing at a Hanukkah celebration inside a rabbi’s home in Monsey New York; a shooting that killed three in a Jersey City kosher market; a recent spate of street attacks in New York City – “may be an outgrowth of that conflict” in a since-deleted tweet on Thursday.  Many accused the network of victim-blaming comparing it to other popular blame-transfer mechanisms favored by MSM. “Her dress was too short” one user snarked. “Or too long in this case” another commented slyly referencing Hasidic dress which outfits women in full-length skirts and other ultra-modest looks.   “Civic sparring” joins an ever-growing sea of mainstream media euphemisms devised to insulate readers and reporters both from uncomfortable realities – in this case the idea that diversity might not always be our strength and that communities with dramatically different values might not do well living on top of each other. After drowning in angry replies NBC removed the “civic sparring” tweet regretting the “error” and promising another non-offensive message to follow. Instead they placed their foot deeper in their mouth – though admittedly just tweeting the article’s headline. “Anti-Semitism grows in Jewish communities in NYC suburbs” made it sound like the Jewish communities were the ones being antisemitic. Social media had other suggestions. MSM has become notorious for whipping up euphemisms to cover up inconvenient truths whether it’s the “cultural enrichment” accompanying the crime spike in Europe or the “austere religious scholar” who led the Islamic State terror group (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) until he was blown up and given a stirring eulogy by the Washington Post. These outlets have no problem irresponsibly exaggerating some issues – “Free speech is killing us!” cried a New York Times op-ed that likened online “hate speech” to physical violence in order to demand government censorship – the latest in a long string of articles about social media supposedly turning Americans into froth-mouthed extremists. New York Magazine published “Why Migrant Detention Centers Are Concentration Camps” in June only to apparently change the name to something a bit more nuanced. These same outlets can be counted upon to either minimize – as they did upon learning that a rabidly anti-Iran cult that allegedly tortures its members has run such an effective campaign to radicalize Americans against Iran online that the president retweeted it and the State Department sank $1.5 million into an identical social media program - or completely ignore others as when the AP actually deleted an article on those same border “concentration camps” when it learned the scary statistic it found had been reached under Obama.  It may be easier (and more cathartic) to just assume that NBC is being anti-Semitic and scream at them. But the narrative management is more sophisticated. NBC certainly doesn’t hate Jews – as long as they’re playing their assigned part in the narrative. It will ignore an entire documentary exposing the Israeli lobby’s penetration into the American government (and media in what is no doubt merely a coincidence). But the rainbow of diversity dissolving into rivers of blood? They’ll pass on that one. Like this story?

64,If you’re an artist in modern Hollywood and you’re looking to score some easy brownie points with fellow celebrities and the mainstream entertainment press a pretty good bet is to call out Trump. It’s easy low-hanging fruit and it seems to work for C-list celebs like Alyssa Milano and Bette Midler so why not?  Howard a former child star who grew up to be a director tried for one of those Trump slams on Twitter but things did not seem to exactly go according to plan. “In the entertainment industry many who have known/worked w/ Trump think that while his reality show was fun and ran a long time he’s a self-serving dishonest morally bankrupt ego maniac who doesn’t care about anything or anyone but his Fame &amp; bank account &amp; is hustling the US” Howard tweeted after being asked why Hollywood is so consistently against the US president.  The attempt to give ‘insider’ knowledge about Trump did not go over well. Apparently the last person people want to hear preach politics is Richie from ‘Happy Days.’ Maybe the worst zinger came from Robbin Young a former Bond actress and Playmate who'd worked with Howard back in the 1980s. “Says Ron Howard my ‘Night Shift’ director who described the majority of the film industry. BTW Ron is there still rampant drug use and adultery in your film trailers and offset by film execs and cast?!” Young tweeted at Howard.  Other artists were also quick to push back against Howard’s theory about Trump. “Yea that’s why he gave it up donates his entire salary to charity and puts up getting trashed in the liberal controlled media over every petty little thing. Trump is a patriot he supports and understands the average American and he has given us the best economy of our life” actress Mindy Robinson tweeted at the director. “Nice audition Ron! We have a lot of other people in Hollywood just exactly like you that we are considering. But your seeming sincerity and your vicious hyperbole comforts us that you are TRULY 'one of us!' We'll be in touch!” quipped actor and director Nick Searcy. Others reminded 'Opie' – a name that trended on Twitter thanks to people poking fun at Howard who played the role of Opie – about some of Hollywood’s less savory types by posting pictures of the director with Harvey Weinstein the disgraced producer who has been accused of rape by numerous women.

65,"The Sudanese army has confirmed that nobody survived the crash which occurred just five minutes after the ill-fated plane took off from El Geneina airport in West Darfur. The region has seen heavy fighting between tribal militias in the recent days. ""An Antonov 12 military plane crashed Thursday night after takeoff from El Geneina killing its seven-member crew three judges and eight civilians including four children who were onboard” army spokesman Amer Mohammed Al-Hassan said as cited by AFP. The plane was reportedly on a mission to deliver aid to the crisis-stricken area. Photos of smoke billowing from the badly charred debris of the aircraft quickly emerged online. The incident comes as West Darfur experiences a spike in violence between Arab and African Masalit tribes after a camp for the internally displaced persons near el-Geneina was raided before New Year’s Eve. Skirmishes reportedly broke out after Arab tribesman moved into the camp opening fire on its residents a spokesman for the joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping mission in Darfur said Wednesday. Several dozen people have been killed in the resulting fighting.

66,According to Ambassador Iraj Masjedi the convoy was en route from the airport to Baghdad when it was hit by airstrikes on Friday morning. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis the second-in-command of Iraq’s Shia paramilitary Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) was killed alongside Soleimani. PMU officials earlier confirmed that several “important guests” had perished together with the militias blaming “the American and Israeli enemy” for their deaths. Masjedi said the victims’ bodies will be delivered to Iran “as soon as possible.” The umbrella group of Shia militias integrated into Iraq’s armed forces was blamed for the siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week.  Later in the day the Pentagon admitted that US President Donald Trump had ordered the killing of Soleimani “to protect US personnel abroad.” Muhammad Reza Al-Jabri director of public relations at the PMU was reportedly killed in the strike. The two vehicles were captured on video burning on the road leading to the airport. Hours after the attack the PMU confirmed the death of its PR director calling the alleged retaliatory sortie a “cowardly US bombing” according to Reuters.  The incident forced the airport into an immediate shutdown. All inbound and outbound flights have been canceled or diverted for the time being. The airport is located next to the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Center (BDSC) which is used by diplomats and intelligence operatives as well as the US-led anti-terrorist coalition forces in Iraq. The area is also home to the joint counter-terrorism center. The strikes come amid soaring tensions between Tehran and Washington over recent events in Iraq. A US air raid on an Iraqi Shia militia last weekend triggered a heated demonstration at the US embassy complex in Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone on Tuesday. Protesters smashed windows lit fires and chanted anti-American slogans. Washington insisted the raid was in retaliation for a militia rocket attack on a US base in Kirkuk and that Iran provided backing for the assault though it offered no evidence for the claim.

67,"News of the commander’s demise was carried by Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency citing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Earlier Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) blamed the US and Tel Aviv for Soleimani's takedown. ""The American and Israeli enemy is responsible for killing the mujahideen Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Qassem Soleimani"" said Ahmed al-Assadi a spokesman for Iraq's PMF as cited by Reuters. Al-Muhandis is the deputy chief of the PMF the umbrella group of Shia militias integrated into the Iraq’s armed forces which was blamed for the siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week. Al-Muhandis and Soleimani were apparently in a convoy traveling near the Baghdad airport when it was struck by multiple missiles. The PMF earlier confirmed the deaths of five of its members and two “guests.” Reuters reported that the Pentagon has claimed responsibility for the strike citing an unnamed US official. US Marines also reportedly captured two other influential Iraqi militia figures around the time of the strikes – Qais Khazali head of the paramilitary group Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Badr Organization leader Hadi al-Amiri – in a neighborhood of Baghdad according to Al Arabiya. While still lacking official confirmation that Washington was behind the assassinations some US lawmakers have already challenged the legality of the supposed American raid as Congress was apparently left in the dark about the mission. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) weighed in with a tweet later on Thursday sounding alarm that the unauthorized operation could kick off a “massive regional war” even though Soleimani was an “enemy of the United States.” The high-profile assassinations come as tensions soar between Tehran and Washington over recent events in Iraq. An American air raid on an Iraqi Shia militia last weekend triggered a heated protest at the US embassy complex in Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone on Tuesday where demonstrators smashed windows lit fires and chanted “Death to America.” Washington claimed the raid was in retaliation for a militia rocket attack on a US base in Kirkuk and that Iran provided backing for the assault though it offered no evidence.

68,"“At the direction of the president the US military has taken decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani” the Pentagon said in a statement. The Pentagon said that the assassination was a response to “attacks on coalition bases in Iraq” accusing Soleimani of being the mastermind behind a recent spate of missile attacks on joint US and Iraqi military installations. In particular the Pentagon blamed Soleimani for orchestrating the December 27 rocket strike at a US base in Kirkuk that killed one American contractor. It also alleged that he “approved” a siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad that almost ended up in the compound being taken over by protesters who were furious over US strikes that killed 25 members of Kataib Hezbollah part of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) over the weekend. Washington has pinned the blame for the attacks on its embassy in Baghdad squarely on Tehran with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accusing “terrorists” and “Iranian proxies” of instigating the unrest. Tehran meanwhile has vehemently denied the accusations that it was somehow complicit in the storming of US diplomatic quarters in the heavily fortified Green Zone taking aim at Washington’s “audacity” to blame it for the outrage sparked by American airstrikes. The strikes which the US military framed as a tit-for-tat response for the Kirkuk attack drew ire not only from the Iran-backed Iraqi militias but also from the authorities in Baghdad which denounced the sorties as an ""unacceptable vicious assault."" The protests saw scores of Iraqi Shia militia members swarming the area in front of the embassy chanting “Death to America” and setting the entrance checkpoints on fire. Earlier the news of Soleimani’s demise was confirmed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps.

Defense Minister Amir Hatami pledged to exact “a crushing revenge” for the death of Soleimani. “We will take revenge on all those involved and responsible for his assassination” he said. Mohsen Rezaee a member of a council that advises Khamenei and a retired major general in the Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) also sent out a tweet on Thursday night vowing swift retaliation for the assassination. “Martyr [#Qasem Soleimani]… joined his martyred brothers but we will take vigorous revenge on America” he said. A number of US airstrikes near Baghdad International Airport earlier on Thursday left Soleimani and several Iraqi militia leaders dead with two other Iraqi commanders reportedly arrested by US Marines. The Pentagon later confirmed the strikes stating they were “aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans.” A number of American lawmakers also weighed in some engaging in sabre-rattling while others such as Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) sounded the alarm about the prospect of a “massive regional war.” “If Iran continues to attack America and our allies they should pay the heaviest of prices which includes the destruction of their oil refineries” Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said in a tweet. An Iranian military spokesman speaking to the semi-official Fars News agency on condition of anonymity said the country’s top security body had called a meeting to discuss the “criminal attack” that killed the Quds Force commander.

""Soleimani's martyrdom will make Iran more decisive to resist America's expansionism and to defend our Islamic values. With no doubt Iran and other freedom-seeking countries in the region will take revenge"" Rouhani said in a statement adding that the killing will only strengthen Iran's resolve in resisting the US. ""Undoubtedly such a villainous and cowardly measure is another sign of the US' frustration and incapability in the region and signifies the regional nations' aversion to this aggressive regime"" the president noted. Similar sentiment has been voiced by several top-ranking figures in Tehran in the wake of the assassination of the Quds commander. Iranian officials say the US targeted the IRGC and Soleimani in particular for the role they played in defeating the jihadist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

71,Former vice president and one of the top Democrat contenders in the 2020 presidential race Joe Biden called the airstrike in Iraq “a hugely escalatory move in an already dangerous region” that will likely provoke “future attacks by Iran” instead of deterring them. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said that Trump’s order to take out Soleimani was issued “without the consultation of the Congress.” She argued that the move will provoke more violence in the region saying that Washington “cannot afford to have tensions escalate to the point of no return.” Similar sentiment was voiced by Senators Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) both of whom are 2020 hopefuls. The president’s “dangerous escalation brings us closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East that could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars” Sanders said. Warren called the airstrike “reckless” stressing that “our priority must be to avoid another costly war.” Some Republicans meanwhile praised the move. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) wrote on Twitter that Soleimani was “an active enemy combatant” and “more dangerous” than Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden and Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) chief Abu Bark al-Baghdadi both of whom have been killed during US raids. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) hailed the “bold action” by Trump as a “direct response to Iranian aggression orchestrated by General Soleimani and his proxies.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo went further posting a video which appeared to show Iraqis running down a street carrying national flags. The people in the video were “dancing in the street for freedom; thankful that General Soleimani is no more” the diplomat wrote. The Pentagon confirmed that Trump personally authorized the airstrike that killed Soleimani on the road near Baghdad’s airport. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis the second-in-command of Iraq’s Shia paramilitary Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) had also died in the strike along with several other Trump himself has yet to comment on the air raid apart from tweeting a photo of the US national flag.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani branded the killing a “cowardly act” that confirms “the weakness of the United States in the region.”  Iraq’s caretaker prime minister Adil Abdul Mahdi said the US assassination operation was a “flagrant violation of Iraqi sovereignty” and an insult to the dignity of his country. The assassination comes days after Iran-backed Iraqi militias staged a riot at the US embassy in Baghdad a response to US retaliatory airstrikes on militia forces. The Pentagon insisted that the killing of Soleimani represented “decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad.”   In April 2019 the US designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization. Trump declared that Iran was “a state sponsor of terrorism” and that the IRGC “actively participates in finances and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft.” Think your friends would be interested?

79,The cards depict an unnamed cartoon assassin aping comments Trump made on the 2016 campaign trail as it says “I just shot Donald Trump on Fifth Avenue and no one arrested me” with a smoking gun in hand. Trump famously bragged that such was his support he could literally get away with murder on the streets of NY and still be elected.  Republican Louisiana Rep. Mike Johnson shared an image of the card he received and decried the extremism of the so-called “radical left” on display. Even an erstwhile opponent of Trump Mark Zaid the attorney who represents the whistleblower in the Ukraine controversy at the heart of the impeachment hearings expressed his disgust at the cartoon saying it “absolutely crosses the line.” Others called for calm arguing that the softcore porn magazine was hardly representative of the Democratic Party platform. Meanwhile the hilarity of the situation proved too much for others who couldn’t resist the opportunity to point out how ridiculous the entire situation was. Hustler magazine confirmed the card's authenticity as the company’s official holiday card which was sent to multiple congressional offices but has so far declined to comment on the controversy.  The magazine’s founder Larry Flynt is a known critic of the US president and previously offered a $1 million reward for anyone who could provide him with compromising footage of then-candidate Donald Trump. He later took out a full-page ad in the Washington Post offering $10 million for information leading to Trump's impeachment and removal from office.  It’s not the first time an artistic portrayal of a Trump assassination has drawn controversy. A 2017 production of Julius Caesar by the Shakespeare in the Park group depicted a Trumpian 'Caesar' being repeatedly stabbed to death much to the outrage and consternation of conservatives and Trump supporters. The play went on to lose sponsors Delta Air Lines among others. Like this story? Share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/477376-hustler-trump-assassination-card/,None
80,The Israeli leader said his country “stands with the United States in its just struggle for peace security and self-defense” accusing Soleimani of having staged and planned attacks against “American citizens and many other innocent people.” Qassem Soleimani the commander of the elite Quds Force was killed by a US airstrike outside of the Baghdad International Airport in an early Friday targeted assassination operation. Netanyahu cut short his visit to Greece and returned to Israel in response to the news. The US killing of the senior general has angered people in both Iran and Iraq. Tehran pledged to retaliate for Soleimani death while Iraqi caretaker prime minister said Washington has violated the terms under which Baghdad allows the US to station its troops on its soil. Among the dozen people killed by the US airstrike was a senior commander of the Iraqi militia backed by Iran.

81,Pompeo made his remarks after speaking over the phone with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and Yang Jiechi the head of the Chinese ruling Communist Party’s Foreign Affairs Commission. “The US remains committed to de-escalation” Pompeo said. A US drone strike killed Major General Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad’s airport on Friday morning. The Pentagon later revealed that the raid was personally greenlighted by US President Donald Trump. “The President's decision to remove Soleimani from the battlefield saved American lives” Pompeo told CNN. The US top diplomat added that Soleimani was “actively plotting” to “take big action… that would have put hundreds of lives at risk.” While touting the assassination of Soleimani as a preventive measure meant to stop a supposed attack on Americans the Trump administration came up short in terms of offering proof that Iran was preparing one. This follows a pattern by which Washington has justified anti-Iranian actions by reference to vague threats to American interests since May 2019 when the US ordered a build-up of its military presence in the Middle East. The US is pursuing a so-called 'maximum pressure campaign' against Iran which is supposedly aimed at forcing it to sign a deal on terms that are more favorable to American interests that those of the Obama-era agreement that restricted the Iranian nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. President Trump scrapped the deal and doubled down on economic sanctions. Soleimani was a highly popular figure in Iran and had many supporters in Iraq as well thanks to the crucial role he played in organizing Shiite militias fighting against the terrorist group Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS). Key US ally Israel has been waging an air war against Iran-backed militias in Syria for years calling them a threat to its national security. Tehran slammed the airstrike that killed Soleimani as “international terrorism.” The Iraqi authorities on whose soil Soleimani was killed blasted the raid as well. The operation was a “flagrant violation” of Iraqi sovereignty the country’s Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi said. Lebanon has also joined in the condemnation. Think your friends would be interested?

82,“US citizens should depart via airline while possible and failing that to other countries via land” the State Department advised. “Due to Iranian-backed militia attacks at the US Embassy compound [in Baghdad] all public consular operations are suspended until further notice.” The advisory comes in the immediate aftermath of the US assassination of Soleimani commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force along with senior leaders of the Iraqi Shia militia in an air strike near Baghdad International Airport on Friday morning. The Pentagon claims the strike was “aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington is committed to “de-escalation” following its “defensive action to eliminate Qassem Soleimani.” In a series of similarly-worded tweets Pompeo said he had spoken with Britain’s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas about the killing. Iranian officials have vowed to exact a “vigorous revenge” on the US for the death of Soleimani with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warning that “revenge awaits the criminals who have stained their hands in his blood.” The incident marks a serious escalation between the US and Iran following heightened tensions over the siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week. Protesters besieged the Green Zone site after a US air raid on an Iraqi Shia militia with Washington blaming Iran for backing the assault on the embassy. Think your friends would be interested?

83,The commander of the elite Quds Force was killed overnight in Baghdad International Airport alongside with several other high-ranking officials from local pro-Iranian militias. The assassination was carried out on the personal “direction” of Trump the US military has said claiming it was acting to protect America and its citizens. Soleimani was blamed for “the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members” and was accused of plotting further attacks on the US. While the killing prompted a lot of self-back-patting among top US officials over a job well done the US President himself took an apparent conciliatory tone suggesting that the attack was carried out to push Tehran into negotiations.  In a separate thread Trump praised himself for the assassination insisting that Soleimani “killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time and was plotting to kill many more” and therefore “should have been taken out many years ago.” He also claimed that the Quds Force chief was “both hated and feared” in his home country and that the Iranians “are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe.” Earlier in the day Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called the killing of Soleimani a “defensive action” and said “the US remains committed to de-escalation.”  But with the assassination having triggered massive outrage both in Iran and Iraq any gesture of outreach from the US is bound to fall flat. Tehran has called the attack an “act of international terrorism” vowing “vigorous revenge on America” for the death of Soleimani. Iraqi officials have been angered by the airstrike with PM Adil Abdul Mahdi calling it a “flagrant violation” of its sovereignty. The murder has apparently reinvigorated Iraq's efforts to get the US troops out; the two major parliamentary blocs have called for the adoption of a law mandating the withdrawal of all foreign military personnel from the country. Influential Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said the killing targeted Iraqi opposition members and extended his condolences to Tehran. He also hinted at the re-establishment of his anti-US militia known as the Mahdi Army disbanded over a decade ago urging its members to get ready to protect Iraq.

85,"Major-General Soleimani and the second-in-command of the Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed (along with others) in a US airstrike at Baghdad's airport on Friday morning.  The ""targeted killings"" of both men ""most likely violate international law incl[uding] human rights law"" the UN's Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Summary or Arbitrary Executions Agnes Callamard wrote on social media shortly after the attack. The human rights expert said that such an attack may have been justified to protect against ""an imminent threat to life"" or in self-defense but this ""test is unlikely to be met in these particular cases."" The Pentagon argued that the airstrikes were aimed at ""deterring future Iranian attack plans."" Callamard however dismissed this reasoning as being ""very vague"" and therefore unable to qualify as rationale to carry out targeted killings under international law. In total eight more people died along with Soleimani and al-Muhandis. The UN rapporteur stressed that such ""collateral"" damage is also unlawful. The airstrikes received praise among US President Donald Trump's allies in the Republican Party but were called reckless and escalatory by his opponents in the Democratic Party.

According to some reports police checked if the man was carrying any explosives but none were found at the scene.   The man reportedly attacked several people before attempting to flee the scene but was shot by police and fatally wounded. It’s not clear what his motives were or if he had any accomplices. Hay-les-Roses Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun told reporters that one person had been killed in the attack and the suspect was shot as he moved towards a nearby shopping center. Two others were injured.

87,"The outgoing leader warned on Friday that Iran and the US must de-escalate tensions otherwise the Middle East will see yet more conflict that would “bring further misery to the region 17 years on from the disastrous invasion of Iraq.” Corbyn branded the assassination of Soleimani who was regarded as the second-most powerful person in Iran after Supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei as “an extremely serious and dangerous escalation of conflict.” He called on PM Boris Johnson’s administration to attempt to put the brakes on the military actions of the United States. Earlier British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the UK government “recognized the aggressive threat posed by the Iranian Quds force led by Qassem Soleimani” but that any escalation of the conflict would be “in none of our interests.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took to social media to reveal that he and Raab had discussed the incident and claimed Britain acknowledged the aggressive threats posed by the Iranian Quds Force. ""The US remains committed to de-escalation"" Pompeo added. Soleimani was killed in a US military airstrike near Baghdad International Airport in the early hours of Friday.

I for one would welcome our New Zealand overlords. Please send leadership” one concerned Aussie wrote in response. “Wish you could take Scott Morrison’s place for the next few months we need some humanity and help this is a disaster!” wrote user Charlotte Curd. Other posters echoed her sentiments asking: “Can you come be our PM please?!”  Many lauded Ardern’s kindness and compassion often juxtaposing it with Australia’s actual Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s perceived coldness and ineptitude.  “You are doing more for a country that is not even your own than our own leader is doing for us thank you” wrote one user.  “@jacindaardern is it possible to be leader of 2 nations? Asking for a mate” joked another. Eight people have died in the fires since Monday bringing the total killed in the natural disaster since July  to 16. Some 450 homes have been destroyed and hundreds have been displaced and many more forced to evacuate with help from the Australian Air Force and Navy in particular.  Ardern displayed an empathy and compassion that many felt were sorely lacking from Australia's own prime minister who has faced severe criticism for his handling of the bushfire crisis including going on vacation to Hawaii.  More recently in an apparent attempt at damage control and to foster some good PR Morrison visited some of the worst-affected communities only to engage in a series of failed handshakes and cringeworthy gaffes before being chased out of town by irate locals.

89,"The deadly fires show no signs of slowing with temperatures expected to reach well over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and ""extreme"" fire danger predicted for South Australia. The blaze is expected to consume the entirety of a national park in that province's Kangaroo Island and an evacuation order has been issued for over 100000 people. Meanwhile the government of New South Wales declared a state of emergency to take effect on Friday. Forecasters are predicting even worse on Saturday. ""Conditions are set to mirror or even deteriorate beyond what we saw on New Year's Eve"" the Bureau of Meteorology's Jonathan How said in a briefing warning that strong and dry winds would likely bring fires back to life in already-devastated regions. New Year's Eve saw residents of coastal communities forced to take to the water to avoid being engulfed in flames. Close to half a billion animals are believed to have been lost in the blaze according to ecologists from the University of Sydney. The koala population has been especially devastated due to their slow speeds preventing them from escaping the inferno – some 30 percent of one koala colony in the northeast is believed to have been destroyed. Entire species may have been decimated News Corp Australia reported earlier this week warning the damage will only increase as the fires having already burned an area larger than Denmark continue to grow. With over 12 million hectares destroyed the fires are so large they are capable of generating their own weather systems including lightning that can strike dry brush and seed new fires. Tens of thousands of people are being evacuated from the provinces of Victoria and New South Wales – ""the largest evacuation of people out of the region ever"" according to NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance. A ""Tourist Leave Zone"" across NSW has been established in the hopes of convincing visitors to get out before evacuation likely becomes impossible on Saturday while thousands have been evacuated on ships with the help of the Australian Navy from the coastal town of Mallacoota. Over 1300 homes have been destroyed and at least 17 deaths have been reported. While not the deadliest fire season in Australian history – yet – there are still months to go before it's over.

91,A series of three videos (since removed) were posted to Khan’s account on Friday with the PM claiming they showed a brutal crackdown on India’s Muslims by local police. The first video captioned “Indian police's pogrom against Muslims in UP [Uttar Pradesh]” was particularly gruesome – it showed what appeared to be riot police beating up “civilians” with sticks and shooting at them as they bled.  Eagle-eyed users promptly pointed out however that the video was not what Khan or those handling his account claimed it to be. Upon closer inspection it turned out the video was not even shot in India. Ever-vigilant online sleuths determined it showed the Bangladeshi Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) counter-terrorist police force cracking down on an Islamist group in the country’s capital city Dhaka seven years ago. It could be argued that it was relatively easy to trace back the origins of the footage since the uniforms and insignias of the RAB are visible in the video. The mix-up did not go unnoticed by the Indian part of the Twittersphere including by the country’s law enforcement as the Uttar Pradesh police soon tagged Khan in a post with a link to the original video from Bangladesh. India’s envoy to the UN Syed Akbaruddin joined in the criticism. The diplomat shared a video compilation of Khan’s posts accompanying it with the caption “Repeat Offenders” and the hashtag #oldhabitsdiehard. The video stayed on Khan’s Twitter for about an hour before it was pulled without any explanation. Two others dubbed ‘Indian Police attacking Muslims as part of Modi Govt's ethnic cleansing’ remained online for a little longer but ultimately vanished as well. One of these two clips was later traced back to a November 2019 farmers’ protests in Unnao district in Uttar Pradesh.  It was not immediately clear whether or not the third video was authentic. The incident sparked a storm of mockery and criticism from Indian netizens as they took to the social media platform to vent their anger – or amusement in some cases – over Khan’s apparent social media faux pas.  Some said he should hire a better social media team – implying that the mishap will see the current one given the boot. Think your friends would be interested?

92,After the strike on Baghdad airport “we are dealing with a different reality” de Blasio told a press conference on Friday admitting that “none of us know how this will play out” as it has been decades since the US confronted “the reality of a war with the government of a large country with an international terror network at its behest.” Previous terror attacks on New York he pointed out came from “non-state actors” without Iran's resources. Warning New Yorkers to maintain “constant vigilance” he explained that it was “probably unlikely” that anything would happen in the near future but “my fear is not just about the immediate term – it’s about what happens in the months and even years ahead.” Stressing his “absolute confidence” in the New York Police Department – with whom he has clashed on numerous occasions – he nevertheless insisted “there will not be a moment where we let down our guard particularly where the possibility of hostilities with such a dangerous adversary exist.” Of course just because the city might be besieged by frighteningly well-equipped government-backed “terrorists” doesn’t mean New Yorkers should change their routines. Citizens should “continue to go about our lives unafraid unaware always realistic tough” de Blasio advised after he had suitably terrified his audience. Representatives from the NYPD admitted there are “no specific credible threats” but pledged to “monitor the threat stream” and advised New Yorkers that “uniformed officers many with long guns” would be stationed in “sensitive areas.” The mayor said he was personally glad that Qassem Soleimani Iran’s beloved military commander was dead. But he added “we have to assume that this action puts us in a de facto state of war and that can only be done under the laws of the Constitution.” “We should not go to war with Iran – it’s extremely dangerous for the American people” de Blasio said. While Trump has yet to beg Congress for the green-light to go to war he has merely followed in the footsteps of Barack Obama who stretched a 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force that gave the military carte blanche to chase 'Al-Qaeda' into any country to justify his own Middle Eastern adventures. Curiously Trump himself has repeatedly said that it was time to end the “endless wars” in the region – something even de Blasio seems to agree with him on saying that “I think the American people have sent a message in election after election that we want to end all these wars.” Like this story?

93,"The Trump administration escalated its standoff with Iran to a whole new level on Friday by ordering a targeted assassination of Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s Quds Force. The Iranian general was blown up along with 11 other people including a senior commander of an Iraqi militia backed by Tehran when their motorcade was hit by US guided missiles just outside Baghdad International Airport. The attack marks a dramatic and extremely dangerous change in US policies vis-à-vis Iran Middle East-based journalist and writer Ali Rizk told RT. Washington claims it was justified in killing Soleimani because the Iranian general was planning attacks on American citizens. As the commander of the commando branch of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) he was directly involved in coordinating the activities of various militia groups in Iraq and Syria. The militias played an essential part in fighting against the terrorist group Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) in both countries boosting Iranian regional influence and Soleimani’s personal popularity. The American government which formally designated the IRGC a terrorist organization amid last year’s growing hostility towards Iran appears to see no difference between Soleimani and IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi who was killed in a US raid last October. But with Soleimani being a senior figure and ""part of a state apparatus"" this was a dangerous delusion Rizk believes adding that the precedent in turn will put crosshairs on every US official. Iran cannot let the attack simply slide and has already declared it an act of international terrorism. When Washington put the IRGC on its terrorist list Tehran did the same for the US Central Command (CENTCOM) which seemed like a symbolic gesture at the time. But Iran could now feel justified in targeting any American service member in the Middle East regardless of his or her rank. “If [Iran] doesn’t retaliate it will lose face it will appear as a very weak player in the Middle East which allows its senior officials to be assassinated” said political analyst and filmmaker Andre Vltchek. “If it does retaliate the US will reserve the right to even annihilate the country as we saw in the past.” Trump’s entire policy towards Iran was to put the screws on it without starting an actual shooting war with the presumable goal of signing a deal better than the Obama-era nuclear multilateral agreement that he had scrapped in 2018. So far both countries have steered away from any direct military engagement save for a few lost drones. There were several incidents such as attacks on oil tankers and Saudi Arabian refinery which Washington blamed on the IRGC. Iranian militias in Syria also absorbed dozens of attacks mainly by US ally Israel which sees the presence of the Tehran-backed fighters there as a threat to its national security. The killing of Soleimani is unlikely to get much support internationally with the obvious exceptions of Israel and Saudi Arabia Rizk said. Depending on how far Tehran goes to avenge its general it may even leave Trump with little choice but to declare a full-scale war against Iran an outcome that he tried to avoid but which some in his government as well as others in Tel Aviv and Riyadh have been dreaming about.  More importantly it sets a dangerous precedent that other nations will be looking at not least those that the US designates as rivals.“It was like a killing of the joint chief of staff of a country” Rizk said. “America later on could say: we have the right to target Russian or Chinese military officials. It’s very important for a major power not to let this issue pass.” Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

The author and ‘Charmed’ actress took to Twitter to apologize on behalf of the US and to beg Iran “not to kill us.” “Dear #Iran The USA has disrespected your country your flag your people. 52% of us humbly apologize. We want peace with your nation. We are being held hostage by a terrorist regime. We do not know how to escape. Please do not kill us” she tweeted. To say the tweet did not go over well would be an understatement. The apology got both the actress’ name and “Dear Rose” trending on Twitter as many slammed the actress and even suggested she move out of the US and reside in Iran.  “Hey Rose  If Iran is so great you should go hang out there in the EXACT OUTFIT you're wearing in your profile picture and let us all know how it goes” author and comedian Tim Young wrote in response to McGowan. The actress is wearing a low-cut top in her profile image. “Are you on crack?” asked Daily Caller’s Greg Price.  Retired Marine and Fox News contributor Johnny Jones added that he was “ashamed” that Rose McGowan had previously visited wounded veterans at the Walter Reed hospital. “NOT INSANE” retired Army Infantry Colonel Kurt Schlicter sarcastically wrote in response to the actress. McGowan seemed to see which way the tide was turning so only hours after her initial tweet she sent out a half-hearted apology saying she simply did not want to see another war kick off and more American soldiers killed in combat. “Ok so I freaked out because we may have any impending war. Sometimes it’s okay to freak out on those in power. It’s our right. That is what so many Brave soldiers have fought for. That is democracy. I do not want any more American soldiers killed. That’s it” the actress who describes herself as a “conscientious objector to the USA” on Twitter wrote in her defense.  The apology only stirred the pot more with commenters totally unforgiving of McGowan’s earlier line about “being held hostage by a terrorist regime.” If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/477406-rose-mcgowan-iran-trump/,None

The MP for Oxford West and Abingdon who was first elected to parliament in 2017 revealed she was in a relationship with former Lib Dem press officer Rosy Cobb.  She hit out at critics of her new relationship who suggested it could have a detrimental effect on her political career and branded Parliament as a ""weird and backward"" place when it came to attitudes towards LGBT+ people. Moran’s admission provoked widespread reaction on social media with many questioning why it even made the news as it should be treated as a private matter. One person tweeted“I've just googled pansexual and I still don't care” while another condemned those that suggested it would affect Moran’s ability to do her job as an MP.

96,The decision to dismiss Torra from the office was made by the JEC on Friday with the board annulling an earlier ruling by a local Catalan electoral body which had said Torra could remain in power until he exhausts all appeal options. The Catalan leader was found guilty of disobedience by a Spanish court  on December 19 was fined the hefty sum of €33000 and banned from holding public office for a year. The politician has already vowed to challenge the court’s decision. Torra’s ‘disobedience’ dates back to last year’s general election when he was ordered by Spain’s electoral authority to remove signs and banners in favor of jailed independence leaders by early October but failed to comply. Displayed on the building of the Catalan government in Barcelona for instance was a message which read ‘Freedom for political prisoners and exiles’ across a yellow ribbon – a symbol used by the pro-independence Catalans to support the incarcerated leaders. The JEC ruling was met with anger by pro-independence politicians. Former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont who fled Spain and is now effectively exiled in Belgium called the exclusion of Torra an “outrageous and shameful” move.

97,The entire 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division is now headed to the US base in Kuwait multiple outlets reported citing anonymous Pentagon officials on Friday. The deployment does not appear to be directly in response to the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani however but rather part of the build-up set in motion on Tuesday following the siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad.  A small force of US Marines reinforced the embassy and fended off the Iraqi Shia militia that had attempted to storm it in protest over a US airstrike against their bases last weekend. US President Donald Trump blamed Iran for both a rocket attack that killed one US contractor in Iraq last week and for the embassy siege. He ordered the retaliatory strike that killed Soleimani and several others the White House said. Soleimani was the head of the Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and coordinated operations throughout the Middle East including against Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) terrorists in Syria and Iraq.

98,The ministry slammed the assassination of the Iranian general carried out on orders from Washington calling it a “short-sighted” move that would lead to a “rapid escalation” of tensions in the Middle East. It also described Soleimani as a talented and experienced commander who enjoyed “well-earned authority” throughout the Middle East. In its statement the ministry called the Iranian general’s achievements in fighting international terrorism “undeniable” and warned that his death would be detrimental to the whole system of global security. Soleimani was seen as a key strategist coordinating the efforts of the Iranian advisers assisting both Syrian and Iraqi forces in their fight against terrorists. Iranian media reported that he’d personally assisted Baghdad in several counter-terrorism operations including the liberation of the strategic city of Tikrit from IS jihadists in 2015. The general was killed in a US drone strike at Baghdad’s airport along with Abud Mahdi al-Muhandis the deputy head of the Tehran-backed Iraqi Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) militia and eight other officials. The Pentagon argued its strike was necessary to protect Americans and prevent “future Iranian attack plans.” Iran denounced it as an “act of international terrorism.” Think your friends would be interested?

99,The 11-second clip first posted by the Iraqi TV station Ahad shows an explosion ripping through the parking lot outside Baghdad International Airport on Thursday evening. Ahad TV described the short recording as “the moment of brutal American aggression and the assassination of two martyr leaders Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis” referring to the Iranian general who headed the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the leader of the Iraqi Shia PMF militia. Early reports of the incident indicated that Soleimani and Al-Muhandis were traveling in two separate vehicles in a convoy and that multiple missiles were launched from either US drones or helicopters. Photos of the wreckage released by the Iraqi government also show multiple SUVs burned out on the side of the road by the airport. Think your friends would be interested?

100,The women sued GirlsDoPorn for fraud saying they were lured in with lucrative modeling gigs then told they would be shooting porn but only for foreign collectors and certainly not for the internet. The dishonest tactics “caused the videos to become common knowledge in plaintiffs’ communities and among their relations and peers – the very thing that plaintiffs feared and that defendants expressly assured them would not happen” San Diego Superior Court Judge Enright wrote in his ruling on Thursday.  Enright found that the GirlsDoPorn CEO Michael Pratt videographers Matthew Wolfe and Teddy Gyi and a handful of other conspirators had engaged in “malice oppression or fraud” and imposed a fine of $9.475 million in compensatory damages and $3.3 million in punitive damages. The deception he said occurred over the course of several years and caused severe harm to the victims.  “Collectively they have experienced severe harassment emotional and psychological trauma and reputational harm; lost jobs academic and professional opportunities and family and personal relationships; and had their lives derailed and uprooted” the judge said. Known only as Jane Does 1-22 the women said they were seduced with Craigslist ads for modeling gigs paying $5000 then told they’d be shooting a porn scene instead (usually for less money) when they arrived at the hotel where the shoot was to take place.  However the company told the women – then between the ages of 18 and 23 – that the porn videos they filmed would be distributed solely to private clients outside the US usually in Australia and New Zealand on DVD only and never with their names attached.  GirlsDoPorn even enlisted “reference women” to pose as satisfied “models” reassuring the “new recruits” that “the experience is safe and enjoyable and that the videos have never appeared online or been discovered by anyone in the models’ lives.” Several women claimed the defendants blocked their attempts to back out of the shoot by putting furniture in front of the door. Often after being plied with drugs and alcohol the women were handed an eight-page contract with a single reference to “online purposes” buried at the bottom of the second page and rushed to sign. Enright declared the contracts “unenforceable and void.”  GirlsDoPorn not only posted the videos to its own website but spread them to numerous popular porn sites including PornHub. The women also had links to the videos sent to their friends and family members and some were doxxed on online porn forums. Enright ordered GirlsDoPorn to remove photos and videos of the women from its website though it isn’t clear how or if the images have been scrubbed from other sites. What was originally a civil lawsuit has since spiraled into a federal sex trafficking and child pornography case. Wolfe is currently in jail along with actor Andre Garcia. Gyi secretary Valerie Moser and ‘reference woman’ Amberlyn Dee Nored were arrested but released on bond. Pratt is on the loose and believed to be hiding out in New Zealand; an arrest warrant has been issued for his failure to appear at the civil trial and he is extraditable under the child porn charges he faces.

101,The Quds Force chief was killed in a US airstrike alongside several other Iranian and Iraqi military commanders on the outskirts of the Iraqi capital on Thursday. While Washington – and Tel Aviv – claimed the killing was “defensive” in nature it caused an explosive reaction across Iraq and Iran with thousands strongly condemning the attack. The assassination sparked protests in other countries as well especially in those with sizable Shia Muslim populations. A handful of rallies were held in the Indian-controlled part of the disputed Kashmir region where people flocked to the streets to voice their anger over the murder. Hundreds of protesters also marched in the northern Indian town of Budgam carrying portraits of Soleimani and chanting anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans.   “We will take revenge of their act so that they will bow down. And it is going to be a lesson for our future generations” said an Islamic cleric who led the protests while another scholar insisted that the US and Israel “will be destroyed very soon.” A similar rally was held in the town of Kargil where locals turned up in large numbers to mourn the death of the prominent Iranian commander. Footage from the scene shows residents carrying portraits of Soleimani and placards reading “Down with the USA.” Large banners portraying Iranian leaders could also be seen hanging from several buildings in the town.

102,While some witnesses reported hearing the man shout “Allahu Akhbar” as he began stabbing people - seemingly at random - in a park in the Paris suburb of Villejuif on Friday prosecutors have stated they do not have evidence of radicalization as a motive though “elements linked to religion” that “suggested he had converted to Islam” were found among his belongings according to AFP. The man identified as 22-year-old Nathan C. from his credit card and fingerprints stabbed four people killing a 56-year-old man who tried to protect his wife from the knife-wielding attacker. Another victim is said to be in serious condition. The attacker was shot by police after fleeing to the nearby suburb of Hay-les-Roses. Prosecutors confirmed that Nathan C. had a history of mental health episodes. He is described in French media as a European (presumably white) man barefoot and bearded in a black djellaba.  A suitcase belonging to the attacker found near the site of the stabbings in Hautes-Bruyères Park contained “a very confused letter in which he spoke of Allah and asked for forgiveness” Le Figaro reports adding that “a religious book” - presumably the Koran prosecutors mentioned - “was found not far from his corpse.” While the knifeman was initially reported to be wearing an explosive vest after he reached into his pocket upon being shot an explosives team inspected his body afterwards and found no trace of explosives.

103,YouTube pranksters Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov who go by the names Vovan and Lexus are claiming they tricked Waters (Dem-Calif.) into thinking she was speaking to teen climate change activist Greta Thunberg. Vovan and Lexus made names for themselves by previously pranking Congressman Adam Schiff (Dem-Calif.) into thinking there were nude photos of US President Donald Trump that Schiff could get his hands on. They also claim to have pranked Waters two years ago in a phone call where one posed as Ukraine’s prime minister. Though Waters herself has not responded to the new video the woman at the other end of the phone identifies herself as the congresswoman and sounds an awful lot like her.  In the call the pranksters pretend to be Thunberg and her father with help from a female colleague and claim to have proof that Trump pressured the Ukrainian government into investigating his political rivals something Democrats have claimed for months now is true. Greta’s ‘father’ says on the call that his ‘daughter’ met Trump and he admitted to wrongdoing. “He said to her ‘You know little girl nobody believe you anyway I will tell you the truth. I really pushed on Ukrainian president and you know that you will never achieve your goals like those congressional fools that accuse me” the prankster posing as the famous teenager’s father says. “Oh my God he mentioned the Ukrainian president?” the woman who identifies herself as Waters responds.  ‘Greta’ then proceeds to offer to testify before Congress and Waters asks for a meeting when the teen activist is next in DC.  “And if the public knew that he talked to Greta like that he made her cry and told her she would never achieve – this will go against him too” Waters says. The pranksters claim to have the Trump conversation recorded which also gets Waters excited.  “You bring it to me” she says. “You tell me what day you can get there. And we’ll arrange to meet with you as quickly as we can.” Another highlight of the call is Waters being tricked into believing an island called “Chunga Changa” is an actual place dealing with serious environmental issues.  Though Waters is unlikely to ever admit anything about the call if it really is her Twitter users seem to have made up their mind.

104,Addressing the media at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Friday Trump said General Qassem Soleimani was “plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel” when the US “terminated” him.  “We take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over” he said of Soleimani who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force before his assassination on Thursday night at Baghdad International airport. “We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war” Trump argued repeating his often-stated line about “deep respect” for the people of Iran and disdain for their rulers. “We do not seek regime change” he added but the Iranian “regime’s aggression... must end and must end now.”  While describing Soleimani as a sinister “terrorist” Trump also claimed credit for defeating Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) and argued that the US will target anyone – Iran in particular – who threatens Americans anywhere. However Soleimani and his Quds Force played a key role in defeating both Al-Qaeda and IS terrorists in Syria spoiling the Obama administration’s plans for regime change in Damascus in the process. Soleimani was traveling in a convoy of cars next to Baghdad International Airport when it was struck by multiple missiles launched by US helicopters or drones. In addition to the Iranian general several leaders of the Iraqi Shia militia that had also fought against IS were killed and injured. Washington has blamed Iran and the militia for Tuesday’s siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad – the latest in a string of incidents in Iraq for which Washington has blamed Tehran. Fears that Soleimani’s assassination might spark a war with Iran have been fueled by the news that almost 4000 US troops were deployed to Kuwait this week joining 14000 sent to the region last year as the Pentagon beefs up its military presence citing the “threat” from Tehran.

105,Soleimani was killed on Thursday in a strike outside Baghdad International Airport for which the White House admitted responsibility later that evening. In a statement to RT on Friday retired Virginia Senator Richard Black said the assassination “may presage a new war of aggression—this time against the Iranian people.” Black noted that the commander of the IRGC’s Quds Force had led the fight against both Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) terrorists and Al-Qaeda affiliates in Syria.  The former senator who retired at the end of 2019 cautioned against further escalation in the Middle East recalling a claim predating the 2003 invasion of Iraq that regime change in Tehran was the ultimate objective. “I pray that we draw back from the vast war that looms” Black added. “Neither our soldiers nor our people have a voice to stop it.” Having served in the US Marines during the Vietnam War Black became an outspoken critic of US involvement in Syria during his last term in the Virginia Senate. In 2014 he thanked Syrian President Bashar Assad for saving Christians and Jews from Al-Qaeda and IS. The following year IS dubbed him an “American Crusader” and put him on its enemies list.

106,The general vowed to “confront and expel” foreign forces in a statement on Friday singling out Ankara by name. “We declare jihad and general mobilization to counter the Turkish invasion” Haftar said. “The Turkish friendly people must rise up against the adventurers who force their army to be wiped out in Libya.” The Turkish parliament on Thursday gave the go-ahead for deploying soldiers to reinforce its allies in the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) one of the factions vying for control of Libya since the 2011 ouster of leader Muammar Gaddafi in a US-led NATO operation. Ankara expressed hopes however that the deployment would be unnecessary and that Haftar would halt his months-long offensive on Tripoli launched in April 2019. Though the GNA is the internationally recognized government of Libya most of the country is controlled by a rival government based in Tobruk and LNA troops loyal to Haftar. Under attack since the middle of last year the GNA has been confined to the area around its base of operations in Tripoli. Some observers fear that sending troops could only worsen matters in Libya propelling the war into greater levels of bloodshed. The country is still reeling from the aftermath of Gaddafi’s removal from power – spearheaded by former US President Barack Obama – which ignited years of violent conflict drove Europe’s refugee crisis and created lawlessness in which terror groups flourish.

107,On Friday the LNA said it had shot down a Turkish drone south of Tripoli the seat of the Government of National Accord (GNA). One report identified it as a Bayraktar TB2 armed drone downed after targeting a column of LNA vehicles. On Thursday theTurkish parliament approved the deployment of troops advisers and equipment to Libya to prop up the GNA the internationally recognized authority which controls only a small portion of the country. The exact scope of the deployment was not made public. General Haftar who runs the LNA on behalf of a rival legislature based in Tobruk vowed on Friday to “confront and expel” foreign forces. “We declare jihad and general mobilization to counter the Turkish invasion” Haftar said. “The Turkish friendly people must rise up against the adventurers who force their army to be wiped out in Libya.” Haftar’s LNA has been advancing on Tripoli in fits and starts since April 2019 having secured control over most of Libya except for the deep desert in the south. Libya collapsed into chaos and civil war after the NATO-backed regime change operation in 2011 overthrew the government of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi that had run the country since 1969.

108,The three-car convoy was struck in the northern outskirts of the Iraqi capital in the district of al-Taji late on Friday according to an Iraqi military source cited by Reuters. Six militiamen were reportedly killed in the attack with three others critically injured. It remains unclear who carried out the strike. An unconfirmed photo of the aftermath of the attack emerged on social media showing three burning vehicles two of them overturned. The six killed in the strike have yet to be named but early reports suggesting they hit two paramilitary commanders – Shibl al-Zaydi secretary general of the Kataib al-Imam militia as well as Qais al-Khazali leader of Asaib Ahl al-Haq – were refuted by the PMF in a statement. Instead of senior leaders the convoy contained medics the group said. “Initial sources confirm that the strike targeted a convoy of Popular Mobilisation Forces medics near Taji stadium in Baghdad” said the statement cited by Reuters. The bombing comes on the heels of a US air raid near Baghdad International Airport late Thursday night which killed Iran’s powerful Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani and several top officials in the PMF. Washington argued the strike was “aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans” while Tehran slammed the move as an act of “international terrorism” and threatened “crushing revenge.” Though US President Donald Trump insisted the decision was made “to stop a war” stressing that he didn’t seek “regime change” in Tehran that interpretation was clearly not shared by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei who warned “revenge awaits the criminals who have stained their hands in [Soleimani’s] blood.” Think your friends would be interested?

109,The killing of Soleimani “by any measure is an obvious example of State terrorism and as a criminal act constitutes a gross violation of the fundamental principles of international law including in particular those stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations” Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi wrote in a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the Security Council on Friday. Soleimani the head of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for over 20 years was killed in a US drone strike outside Baghdad International Airport in Iraq on Thursday. Ravanchi added that Tehran reserves the right to self-defense under international law.  The envoy followed this up with interviews to NBC and CNN on Friday evening calling the killing of Soleimani an “act of aggression” and “tantamount to opening a war against Iran.” He confirmed that Iran and the US have exchanged letters through a Swiss intermediary but told NBC that he thinks the administration of US President Donald Trump “does not believe in dialogue.” The assassination he told NBC was “an act of aggression by the United States and we cannot just close our eyes on what happened to a dear general of our armed forces.” Speaking to CNN Ravanchi only elaborated that “the response for a military action is a military action.” Soleimani’s death was planned for “quite some time” Ravanchi argued pointing to a tweet by former Trump adviser John Bolton a known advocate of regime change in Tehran as proof.  Earlier on Friday Trump called Soleimani the “number one terrorist” in the world. The ambassador took exception to that pointing to the general’s role in fighting against both Al-Qaeda affiliates and Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) in Iraq and Syria. “The US cannot claim that it is fighting terror when at the same time it is killing the champion of defeating terrorists in our region” Ravanchi told NBC.

110,The plan will be considered at the church’s major yearly conference in Minneapolis set for May which if approved would rupture the denomination into traditionalist and ‘progressive’ camps. The former branch would continue to oppose LGBT marriage and the ordination of gay and lesbian clergy while the other will open its doors to anyone regardless of sexual orientation. “The protocol provides a pathway that acknowledges our differences respects everyone in the process and graciously allows us to continue to live out the mission of making disciples of Jesus Christ” said New York Conference Bishop Thomas Bickerton who helped draft the proposal. Detailed in a 9-page document released on Friday the schism plan proposes setting aside $25 million in church funds for the traditionalist branch to ease the separation process and would not alter ownership of local church properties. While church leaders say the split would impact Methodist organizations around the globe potentially affecting millions of members a Washington DC-based council of bishops hailed the idea on Friday as the “best means to resolve our differences.” Traditionalist Reverend Keith Boyette said much the same calling it a “fair and equitable solution that puts decades of conflict behind us and gives us a hopeful future.” Same-sex marriage was legalized across the United States by the Supreme Court in 2015 but religious organizations retain the right to decline to officiate gay wedding ceremonies. The plan was developed with the aid of Kenneth Feinberg an attorney and mediator who made his name working on several high-profile cases usually overseeing pay disbursements to plaintiffs including the 2010 British Petroleum oil spill. He was also appointed by the Obama administration’s Department of Justice in 2016 to manage the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.

111,The US-led forces “did NOT conduct airstrikes” in the area in recent days the spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve Colonel Myles Caggins tweeted. Earlier Reuters reported citing an Iraqi Army source that six people were killed and three critically injured in a raid that Iraqi state media blamed on the United States. The Iran-backed Shia militia Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) then reportedly claimed that the airstrike hit a convoy of medics. The reports came after a US drone strike killed the chief of Iran’s elite Quds Force Major General Qassem Soleimani and PMF deputy commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis at Baghdad’s airport.

112,In a new press release cited by several news agencies the PMF leadership retracted their statement in which the group said their medics were hit by a US airstrike. This happened after Reuters cited Iraqi Army sources who said that six people were killed in a raid near Taji. The Iraqi Army however later denied that an airstrike took place there. In a statement quoted by local media the military urged everyone to be “careful” about spreading unverified information and “rumors” in the future. The US-led coalition in Iraq also said that no air raids have been conducted in that area in recent days. The news came after the chief of Iran’s elite Quds Force Major General Qassem Soleimani and PMF deputy commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed by a US drone at Baghdad’s airport. Washington said that Soleimani was targeted in order to deter future attacks by Iran against US military personnel and citizens in Iraq and other places abroad.

He stepped down in November amid mass anti-government protests but has retained his post in a caretaker capacity. The procession carrying the caskets of Soleimani and al-Muhandis which are draped with Iranian and Iraqi flags respectively moved from Kadhimiya a Shia pilgrimage site in Baghdad to the Green Zone government block for the state funeral. Soleimani’s remains are expected to be transported to Iran where a burial will take place in his hometown Kerman on Sunday. Both men were killed at Baghdad’s airport as they were about to drive to the Iraqi capital.

116,The Tripoli-based government of Al-Sarraj struck a military agreement with Turkey which prompted Ankara to send its troops to Libya. Their aim is to confront Khalifa Haftar the powerful Libyan military commander based in the eastern port of Tobruk. The Libyan parliament which backs Haftar said on Saturday it refused to ratify the Turkey deal and called for pressing high treason charges against Fayez Al-Sarraj Al Arabiya reported. The lawmakers said they may refer the situation to the International Court of Justice. Haftar who commands the so-called Libyan National Army earlier declared mobilization to fight against Turkish troops calling their looming deployment an invasion. Libya once one of the most prosperous nations in Africa remains fractured and devastated since the 2011 NATO bombing campaign that helped militant forces oust and kill long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi. After the war the country became a playground for various competing militias as well as a major human trafficking thoroughfare. Like this story?

117,The temple also known as Gurdwara Nankana Sahib (named after the city in Pakistan’s Punjab province) is a cherished treasure built on the site where the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak Dev was believed to be born. On Friday the location was surrounded by dozens of angry Muslim protesters who were filmed chanting anti-Sikh slogans. The protesters were blocking the entrance to the Gurdwara and according to some reports went as far as tossing stones not only at the building but also at pilgrims. The local police soon arrived and hours later the crowd dispersed. The incident received an angry rebuke from New Delhi. India’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned what it described as “wanton acts of destruction and desecration of the holy place” and called on the Pakistani government “to take immediate steps to ensure the safety security and welfare of members of the Sikh community”. The anger also spilled into street protests in the Indian capital where several Sikh groups gathered on Saturday in front of the office of Pakistan’s High Commissioner to demand protection both for fellow believers based in Pakistan and the treasured holy site. Islamabad downplayed the seriousness of the situation saying it stemmed from a family feud and denied that the Gurdwara was vandalized during the protest. “Attempts to paint this incident as a communal issue are patently motivated. Most importantly the Gurdwara remains untouched and undamaged” said Pakistan’s Foreign Office. “All insinuations to the contrary particularly the claims of acts of 'desecration and destruction' and desecration of the holy place are not only false but also mischievous.” According to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn the protest was led by the family of a Muslim man named Mohammed Ehsan. The paper states the family is currently embroiled in a conflict with the Sikh family of Ehsan’s wife 19-year-old Jagjit Kaur who converted to Islam and married him. Kaur is reported to be the daughter of the Gurdwara's granthi - a ceremonial reader of the Sikh´s Holy Book. The wife’s family insists she was abducted by Ehsan’s family forcefully converted and married to Ehsan. His family denies the accusations insisting both the conversion and the marriage were voluntary. A court eventually ordered that Kaur be removed from the home of the Ehsan family in Lahor and housed at a shelter while the investigation into the conflict is underway. The situation escalated on Friday after the police arrested several members of the Ehsan family including the husband himself. The protest ended after the detainees were released. Like this story?

118,“Vital American targets in the region have been identified by Iran a long time ago” General Gholamali Abuhamzeh who leads the IRGC in Iran’s southern Kerman Province said on Friday evening as quoted by Tasnim News Agency.  The commander did not name any specific targets but mentioned that US warships have been operating in the Strait of Hormuz an important shipping route which connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean. Abuhamzeh made the comments after Soleimani the leader of the IRGC’s Quds Force – a special unit tasked with operations abroad – was killed in a US drone strike at a Baghdad airport. He died along with several high-ranking officials from the Iran-backed Iraqi Shia militias the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). Kerman is Soleimani’s home province. He is expected to be buried there on Sunday.  Killing the Quds leader was the “biggest strategic mistake” the US has made in its four decades of standoff with Iran Abuhamzeh said promising that Tehran will “exact revenge.” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stressed that Iran “does not seek tensions in the region.”  However “the presence and interference of the foreign and extra-regional forces have caused instability insecurity and escalation of tensions” Zarif said during a meeting with his Qatari counterpart Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani in Tehran. Officials in Washington say that Soleimani’s death has prevented major terrorist attacks against the US and saved “hundreds” of American lives. US President Donald Trump has gone as far as calling Soleimani the “number one terrorist in the world” ignoring the fact that the general played a key role in the defeat of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) in Syria and Iraq.

119,"End #TrumpsWar now. Remove our troops from Iraq and Syria the politician from Hawaii tweeted on Saturday. Gabbard a longtime critic of US-led interventions and regime-change wars had earlier argued that killing Soleimani ""was an act of war with no authorization or declaration of war from Congress."" US President Donald Trump ""has put us in a state of war with Iran and has seriously escalated this tit-for-tat conflict pushing us deeper into an endless quagmire"" she said in a video address. Later on Fox &amp; Friends Gabbard stressed that by approving the raid Trump was ""clearly violating the Constitution."" Major General Soleimani was killed in a drone strike at Baghdad's airport on Friday morning. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis the deputy commander of Iran-backed militias the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and eight other officials died with him. US State Secretary Mike Pompeo and the Pentagon insisted that Soleimani was killed in order to prevent future attacks by Iran against US army personnel and civilians. Tehran in turn called the action an act of ""international terrorism"" and vowed to retaliate. The operation was heavily criticized by the Democrats including senators and 2020 hopefuls Joe Biden Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders as well House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who is leading the impeachment of Trump. They all said that the killing of Soleimani further increases tensions in the Middle East and brings Washington closer to an open war with Iran.   Trump's allies in the Republican Party on the other hand welcomed the airstrike with Senator Lindsey Graham calling it ""a preemptive defensive"" action against Iran.

120,France has endured a full month of protests against the controversial reform – on Saturday the general strike reached its 31st consecutive day. Moreover Saturday’s action coincided with Act 60 of the anti-government Yellow Vests protests that have been plaguing France for over a year now. The protesters carried the flags of various trade unions as well as assorted banners that primarily targeted pension reform. Some of them lit firecrackers on the march. One man however was spotted carrying a large plush heart bearing a very personal message for France’s President Emmanuel Macron. The inscription on the giant plushie reads “Macron I hate you with all my heart.”  The infamous 'Macron out' slogan frequently used by the Yellow Vests has apparently evolved over the year of turmoil; at least one banner reading “Macron out – and take your reform with you” has been spotted during the protest. So far the protest remains relatively peaceful despite large numbers of people attending – only minor clashes with the police and very limited use of tear gas have been reported. The pension protests broadly supported by French trade unions kicked off in early December taking form of mass rallies attempts to block infrastructure strikes and work walkouts. The unrest was triggered by the government’s plan to scrap the existing 42 pension schemes and roll out a unified points-based one instead. Critics of the reform accuse the government of trying to rip the workers off and stealing their hard-earned benefits such as the right to early retirement for certain jobs. The authorities however maintain the reform is actually designed to simplify the pension system and make it more transparent.

121,Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed that his nation opposes the use of military force after hearing from his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif who condemned the US’ targeted assassination of Major General Qassem Soleimani on Friday. Wang stressed that the US operation was a breach of international norms and threatened to significantly increase turbulence in the region. The Trump administration’s strategy of maximum pressure against Tehran was impractical the Chinese diplomat added promising that Beijing will hold an objective and fair position necessary to improve the situation in the Middle East. A similar position was voiced by Russia’s Sergey Lavrov who spoke to Zarif on Saturday to express Russia’s condolences over the killing of Soleimani. American behavior fails to address the many problems in the Middle East and only escalates regional tensions the two diplomats agreed. Soleimani the commander of the elite Quds Force was killed in a targeted assassination which Washington claims was necessary to prevent attacks on American citizens. Tehran vowed it would avenge the death of the popular general. If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/news/477468-china-us-abuse-force-soleimani/,None
122,Germany’s Bundeswehr will put on pause all military missions in Iraq it announced late on Friday night. That includes both operations aimed against IS and training of Kurdish troops. There are around 130 German soldiers deployed in Iraq at the moment including 27 stationed at the Taji military base 30km (18 miles) north of Baghdad. The same security lockdown is true for the 70 soldiers from Sweden who act as advisers to the Iraqi military. “We have to see what happens. We cannot go into details for safety reasons but we have paused and taken it hour by hour” explained Swedish military spokesperson Kristina Swaan. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called the situation serious for the 140 soldiers the country has in Iraq but wouldn’t comment on whether it was necessary to bring them home as a precaution. NATO which has many of the same members as the anti-IS coalition has suspended its training operations in Iraq too spokesman for the alliance Dylan White said. NATO has hundreds of personnel under its aegis in the country. The anti-IS coalition members initiated a curfew for its troops following the killing of Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s Quds Force by a US airstrike on Friday morning. Tehran pledged retaliation for what it sees as an act of international terrorism. The killing also led to mass protests in Iran and several other Middle Eastern countries where the assassinated general was perceived as a hero by many. Soleimani played a crucial role in organizing and supporting Shiite militias to fight against IS in Iraq and Syria. The US claimed the assassination was an act of pre-emptive self-defense.

123,When you deliberately kill an important figure for political reasons it’s fair to say that you have assassinated them. But the word has this nasty aftertaste smacking of some criminality or even brainwashed youths with crooked knives. READ MORE: 35 ‘vital US &amp; Israeli targets’ within Iran’s reach for potential REVENGE for General Soleimani’s death – senior IRGC commander So one John Harwood the editor-at-large at CNBC took to Twitter to argue that the killing of Iran’s Quds Force commander should be described in some nicer terms. And if the term is right “did [the] US ‘assassinate’ Osama Bin Laden?” he asked.  It didn’t take long for him to get feedback and the collective answer seemed to be a resounding “yes” to both questions. Some commenters went further and challenged the implied equivalency between the two killings. After all Qassem Soleimani was a high-ranking officer of a UN member country’s military not a stateless fugitive living in obscurity. READ MORE: Iran reserves right to self-defense ‘harsh revenge’ for Soleimani coming – Tehran’s envoy to UN There was also the legal issue of authorization by the US Congress. Bin Laden’s killing was agreed to by US legislators after the 9/11 terrorist attack while Soleimani was targeted in what many have called an abuse of presidential power that may land the US in a new war. Doubts about the strike are widespread even among the centrist part of the Democratic Party which tacitly endorses the claim that Soleimani was a legitimate target for a targeted attack. Donald Trump himself has called Soleimani a “number one” terrorist – which sounds puzzling as the general was instrumental in the defeat of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) which the US president likes taking full credit for.

124,The hoisting ceremony was aired by Iranian state TV on Saturday. The blood-red flag as well as a picture of the slain commander of the elite Quds Force were carried to the roof of the one of the biggest and most important mosques for Shia Muslims. The flag used in the ceremony is called the ‘Ya la-Tharat al-Husayn’ which dates back to the late 7th century. It was first raised after the Battle of Karbala in a call to avenge the death of Imam Husayn ibn Ali which became one of the key events that led to the split between Shia and Sunni Islam. It has been reported that the red flag has never been unfurled atop the Jamkaran (a major holy site since the early Middle Ages) until now. Red flags were also spotted during other events held across country in honor of the slain general. Thousands gathered in Tehran on Saturday shouting slogans and carrying pictures of Soleimani. Some were seen setting Israeli flags on fire. In Iraq where Soleimani was killed in a US airstrike alongside other high-ranking Iranian and Iraqi officials including the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) militia a three-day mourning period has been announced. Commemorative ceremonies there saw people stomping on and burning American flags. A mourning house for Soleimani has been opened in Gaza where people were also seen venting their anger at the US and Israel as well as paying their respects to the dead.

125,The freak incident occurred at Barddhaman railway station located in the Indian state of West Bengal late Saturday. Footage from the scene shows part of the building’s upper floor abruptly collapsing disintegrating into fine dust.  The incident attracted a large crowd of onlookers who came to watch and film the destruction with their cellphones. This turned out to be a pretty bad idea as the damaged part of the building collapsed further dropping a massive sign affixed to its roof right onto the crowd. The subsequent collapse however did not deter the onlookers and a large crowd remains close to the badly damaged building footage from the scene shows. Emergency services have been dispatched to the scene and they are reportedly searching for people who might be trapped under the rubble. Construction work at the station has been blamed for the collapse. At least two people were hospitalized after the incident according to Eastern Railway while four others received medical help onsite. Think your friends would be interested?

126,Several unguided ‘Katyusha’ rockets landed inside the Green Zone the military said in a statement cited by Reuters. There have been no reported casualties so far. Some accounts say one rocket landed not far from the US embassy. One blast allegedly blocked the road leading to the American diplomatic mission in the Iraqi capital. Mortar shells also hit the neighboring Jadriya district where Baghdad University is located injuring at least five people. A separate report suggests that Balad Air Base located some 60 kilometers north of Baghdad has also come under rocket attack. The base houses some American troops. Meanwhile Iraqi Shia militia Kataib Hezbollah has issued a warning to local security forces implying more attacks are coming. People must stay at least one kilometer away from US bases and facilities housing American troops in Iraq starting Sunday evening they were quoted saying by local media. They stopped short of claiming responsibility for Saturday’s rocket attacks though. The incidents come a day after Washington ordered the assassination of one of Iran’s top commanders Major General Qassem Soleimani. The Iraqi Shia PMF militia deputy commander was also killed in the US drone strike alongside a dozen others. The US claimed the assassination was an act of pre-emptive self-defense. Tehran called it an act of international terrorism and vowed revenge. Massive demonstrations mourning the death of Soleimani and the Iraqi militia commanders were held in both Iraq and Iran.

127,The base located some 60km (40 miles) to the north of Baghdad came under attack late on Saturday Reuters reported citing security sources. Two unguided rockets hit the premises of the compound but caused no casualties among the personnel. It was not immediately clear whether they inflicted any material damage. The incident hit the headlines shortly after two explosions hit the Green Zone – the heavily fortified quarter of the Iraqi capital that houses foreign missions and government buildings. One rocket reportedly hit in the vicinity of the US embassy reportedly damaging a road. Meanwhile Iraqi Shia paramilitary group Kataib Hezbollah has warned local forces to steer clear of any US bases or compounds housing American troops. To stay safe they must remain at least one kilometer away from such facilities the group said implying that further attacks are expected. Kataib Hezbollah which emerged during the 2003 invasion of Iraq has been waging anti-US insurgency for years. Currently however it is part of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) – a government-sponsored umbrella organization that united and recognized various militant groups during the Washington-backed campaign against Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) terrorists. The incidents followed the assassination of the Iranian Quds Force commander Major General Qassem Soleimani. He was killed in a US airstrike on the outskirts of Baghdad alongside several other high-ranking Iranian and Iraqi military officials. The killing prompted a furious reaction both in Iran and Iraq. Tehran vowed retaliation for Soleimani’s death which it described as an act of international terrorism. The elite Iranian IRGC force said that at least 35 “vital” US and Israeli targets in the region are within its reach for a guaranteed strike. Iraq meanwhile accused the US of violating its sovereignty. Washington for its part insisted that the assassination was “defensive” in its nature accusing Soleimani of being behind the deaths of “hundreds” of US citizens and alleging he was planning new attacks on the nation’s troops across the region.

128,A group of US military helicopters have been spotted scrambling over Baghdad in the wake of Saturday’s rocket attacks.   Baghdad’s Green Zone housing the US Embassy and the Balad Air Base north of the Iraqi capital was targeted by multiple rockets. Some reports say a rocket landed not too far from the US Embassy. A video posted to Twitter appears to show that one of the rockets caused collateral damage by hitting a house. There have been no official reports of injuries but video footage appears to show civilians being injured as a result of the attacks. There appear to be no US military casualties at this time.    The Saturday attacks follow the Friday assassination of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani in a US drone strike as well as pro-Iran protesters storming the US Embassy in a siege earlier this week.  If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/news/477480-iraq-rocket-attacks-aftermath/,None
129,The 22-year-old suspect identified only as Nathan C went on a rampage at a park to the south of the French capital. The attacker managed to kill a 56-year-old man and injure two more people before the police gunned him down. It apparently took over a day for the French authorities to attribute a terrorist motive to the stabbing as the case was referred to the country’s anti-terrorism prosecutor late on Saturday. The rampage was initially investigated by local prosecutors who said that they uncovered “elements linked to religion” among the suspect’s personal belongings which “suggested he had converted to Islam” recently. The suspect’s possessions included a copy of the Koran which was recovered close to his body. French media described the attacker as a European (presumably white) bearded man who was barefoot at the time of the incident and wore a black djellaba. Local prosecutors however said that the man actually had a history of mental health problems and that “no evidence” of radicalization had been uncovered as of Friday night.

130,In these strange modern times even a liberal director like Gilliam can end up sounding like a conservative voice. In an interview with the Independent promoting his film ‘The Man Who Killed Don Quixote’ which has been in various states of production for 20 years Gilliam gave his blunt thoughts on everything from disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein to possibly identifying as a black lesbian. Speaking about #MeToo cases Gilliam said despite there being real victims the movement was driven by a mob mentality.  “Yeah I said #MeToo is a witch hunt” Gilliam said.  The director said many who came forward should have taken more responsibility for their situations as he believes a female character who works as a model and escort does in his new film. “We’re living in a time where there’s always somebody responsible for your failures and I don’t like this. I want people to take responsibility and not just constantly point a finger at somebody else saying ‘You’ve ruined my life.’” Speaking on the topic of producers like Harvey Weinstein who faced dozens of sexual assault and sexual harassment accusations that kicked off the #MeToo movement Gilliam said no one should be surprised about the things that were happening in Hollywood. He even revealed that he was once propositioned by a “well-known actress” for a part in one of his movies.  Gilliam also doubled down in the interview on a statement he made last year proclaiming to be a black lesbian. While the “revelation” was meant to be a joke mocking modern identity politics ‘woke’ crowds did not see the humor – and neither did Gilliam’s latest interviewer.  “I’m talking about being a man accused of all the wrong in the world because I’m white-skinned. So I better not be a man. I better not be white. OK since I don’t find men sexually attractive I’ve got to be a lesbian. What else can I be? I like girls. These are just logical steps” he said. “I’m just trying to make you start thinking. You see this is the world I grew up in and with Python we could do this stuff and we weren’t offending people. We were giving people a lot of laughter.” On the subject of “giving people a lot of laughter” though the filmmaker seems to believe there is little benefit to being the offensive comedian in today’s bubble-wrapped culture.  If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/477484-terry-gilliam-white-men-metoo/,None
131,Air India flight AI 865 was about to make the trip between India’s capital Delhi and Mumbai on Thursday when an apparent technical glitch forced the plane full of passengers to return from the runaway to its ramp. The crew however did not let the passengers disembark immediately apparently hoping the issue was minor and would be resolved more or less on the spot. This proved however not to be the case. The passengers had to spend more than four hours effectively trapped on the plane before they were finally cleared to get off the aircraft. The long hours of waiting began to wear on people’s patience. Footage emerged online showing disgruntled passengers standing in the aisle as the cabin crew attempts to calm things down. A group of particularly agitated people can be seen knocking on the cockpit door demanding the pilots come out. Some can be heard calling the pilots “losers” while others threaten to break down the door. The cabin crew still somehow managed to keep things under control as according to local media the passengers spent around two more hours inside the plane without much disturbance and the cockpit remained intact. However after more than four hours of waiting some perhaps understandably just about completely lost it. As the crew was about to let the passengers out a woman rushed to the exit door to open it on her own. A flight attendant had to intervene as other passengers pleaded with the woman to let it go. Eventually the passengers flew to Mumbai on another aircraft following an eight-hour delay. All’s well that ends well but that may not apply to at least some of the passengers who could face consequences over their angry outbursts as both the airline and India’s civil aviation regulator DGCA have launched an inquiry into the case. “DGCA has asked Air India management to take necessary action against unruly passengers” the regulator’s official told the local media. India has recently introduced new rules aimed at countering disruptive behavior on airplanes. The punishments under these regulations vary from three-months’ grounding over “physical gestures or verbal harassment” to a lifetime ban on flying for “life-threatening behavior” damage to an aircraft and attempted or actual breach of cockpit.

132,"The ministry has ordered the Royal Navy’s HMS Montrose frigate and HMS Defender destroyer to prepare to accompany all vessels sailing under the British flag through the Strait of Hormuz — the only passage from the Persian Gulf to the ocean that lies between the Iranian and UAE coasts. “The government will take all necessary steps to protect our ships and citizens at this time” Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said commenting on the decision. The move comes after the US killed Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani the commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ elite Quds Force on orders from President Donald Trump. The attack dramatically heightened tensions in the Middle East as Tehran labeled it an act of international terrorism and vowed revenge. Washington maintained it was an act of “self-defense.” London apparently shares that position as Wallace also said that the US “is entitled to defend itself against those posing an imminent threat to their citizens” under international law. However he also called for “de-escalation.” The spike of tensions in the Middle East apparently unnerved the British government as the UK Foreign Ministry has advised its citizens against traveling to Iraq and Iran. ""Given heightened tensions in the region the Foreign Office now advise people not to travel to Iraq with the exception of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and to consider carefully whether it's essential to travel to Iran"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement. London had already sent its warships to patrol the Strait of Hormuz amid another crisis related to Iran earlier this year. Tensions were sparked in July after the seizure of an Iranian-flagged tanker by the British marines off the coast of Gibraltar. Iran denounced this as an act of “state piracy” and retaliated by seizing a UK-flagged vessel as it entered the Strait. The Iranian tanker was released in late August and the British ship was released a month later. The crisis was instrumentalized by Washington which used it to call for a coalition to police Western tankers traveling through the Strait — and London was one of the first to join it.

134,Rocker Meat Loaf is making waves on social media for being one of the latest critics of teen climate change activist Greta Thunberg – and a blunt one at that.  “I feel for that Greta” the 'Paradise by the Dashboard Light' singer told Daily Mail in a recent interview. He added that he believes the 17-year-old Thunberg has been “brainwashed into thinking there is climate change.” The rocker said he does not believe in climate change.  “She hasn’t done anything wrong but she’s been forced into thinking that what she is saying is true” the 72-year-old musician said. It should come with little to no surprise that Meat Loaf’s comments were like throwing a match into the kindling that is social media.  Some criticized the rock star for his criticism of Thunberg who has also been targeted by US President Donald Trump and for his apparent denial of global warming. “It’s almost like Meat Loaf is praying for the end of time to hurry up and arrive” comedian and actor John Fugelsang tweeted. However the rocker found plenty of support for his blunt remarks as well.  “Met Meat Loaf on an airplane once.  Lovely gracious funny man. Good to see he's got a good head on his shoulders and he isn't afraid of the leftist bullies in the business” tweeted outspoken conservative actor and director Nick Searcy. “Meat Loaf is completely correct about Greta Thunberg” conservative reporter Paul Joseph Watson tweeted.

135," Unleashing yet another dire warning to Iran Trump appears to have responded to a recent statement by a senior commander within the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) who said earlier on Saturday that Iran had identified 35 vital US and Israeli targets in the region “a long time ago.” ""If Iran strikes any Americans or American assets we have... targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago) some at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; the Iranian culture and those targets and Iran itself WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD"" Trump tweeted. Trump did not specify which sites the Pentagon had placed on its hit list saying only that some of the targets are “at a very high level.” The threat comes as tensions between Washington and Tehran have reached the boiling point after a US drone strike near Baghdad on Thursday killed the leader of the IRGC’s Quds Force – a special unit tasked with operations abroad. Major General Qassem Soleimani who Trump called Iran’s “terrorist leader” was instrumental in the defeat of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) in Syria and Iraq. The Trump administration’s move to assassinate Soleimani has drawn a mixed reaction in the US. Democratic lawmakers as well as their Republican colleagues were unaware of the operation. But while the GOP has largely rejoiced at the move the Democrats have been crying foul accusing Trump of single-handedly steering the US into a potential all-out war with Iran. The White House formally notified Congress about the strike late Saturday – which however did not placate the Democrats as it apparently shed little light on the circumstances behind Soleimani’s takedown. In a statement on Saturday House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi slammed the strike as “provocative escalatory and disproportionate military engagement” noting that the War Act Powers notice given to lawmakers “prompts serious and urgent questions about the timing manner and justification” of the attack. She also criticized what she called the “highly unusual” decision to classify the document “in its entirety” saying that “the Congress and the American people are being left in the dark about our national security.” She went on to urge Trump to provide “an immediate comprehensive briefing of the full Congress on military engagement related to Iran and next steps under consideration.” Subscribe to RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won’t tell you.

136, “The night of Jan. 4 two rocket attacks occurred near Iraqi bases that host Coalition troops in Baghdad and Balad a total of 13 attacks in the past two months” a statement attributed to coalition spokesman Colonel Myles B. Caggins III said Saturday. The attacks took place within the span of four minutes on Saturday evening local time Caggins reported saying that the first of the two attacks targeted the heavily-fortified Green Zone which hosts a number of diplomatic and military facilities including some that house US troops. Noting that no US military were injured in the shelling the spokesman said that it could have “potentially” led to casualties among the civilian population. “At 7:46 p.m. the International Zone took indirect fire that landed outside of Coalition facilities and potentially harmed Iraqi civilians” the statement read. Several minutes after the rockets hit the Green Zone Balad Air Base located 60 kilometers north of Baghdad which serves as home to some US troops also came under rocket fire the coalition confirmed saying that the Iraqi military has launched an investigation into both incidents. The US coalition’s statement that their forces were apparently targeted in two consecutive rocket attacks comes shortly after US President Donald Trump upped the ante in the war of words with Tehran vowing to strike as many as 52 Iranian sites if Iran makes good on its vow to avenge the assassination of Major General Qassem Soleimani a hugely popular commander of the Revolutionary Guards Corps’ Quds Force in a US drone strike on Thursday. Earlier this week the US Embassy in Baghdad barely escaped a takeover by Iraqi protesters following a series of US airstrikes that killed 25 Shia militia fighters a week ago. The demonstrators chanted “death to America” and even managed to set checkpoints on fire. Security personnel deployed tear gas to force the angry crowds to retreat.

137,The website run by the FDPL a US government program set up to ensure federal government publications are available to the public free of charge was apparently hacked by a group claiming to be from Iran on Saturday evening. The site which currently cannot be accessed briefly showed a message purportedly left by hackers calling themselves ‘Iran Cyber Security Group HackerS’ The front page showed a close-up shot of US President Donald Trump being punched in the face with blood coming out of his mouth. The fist was made to look like it belonged to a uniformed member of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with the elite force’s official logo known as Pasdaran visible on the sleeve. Accompanying the picture was a message in Persian and in English promising “severe revenge” on those complicit in the assassination of the IRGC’s Quds Force leader Qassem Soleimani who was killed in a US drone strike in Baghdad on Thursday. While it has since been taken down the message purportedly left by “Iranian hackers” can still be found on Google search. “In the name of god. Hacked By Iran Cyber Security Group HackerS;). This is only small part of Iran's cyber ability ! We're always ready” it reads. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed the breach late Saturday but did not immediately point the finger at Tehran. “At this time there is no confirmation that this was the action of Iranian state-sponsored actors” Sara Sendek a spokesperson for DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said as cited by CNN. The Government Publishing Office (GPO) which runs the program noted that the website was take down as soon as the “intrusion” was discovered. The incident comes just hours after the DHS sounded the alarm over a supposed “terrorism threat” to the US from Iran saying that the Islamic Republic “can execute cyber-attacks against the United States” that may have a “temporary disruptive effect” on critical infrastructure. Following the killing of Soleimani who played an important role in the fight against Al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) in both Iraq and Syria Iran said that it reserves the right to retaliate. A senior commander within the IRGC said on Saturday that the Iranian military has identified 35 US and Israeli targets in the region. Hours after the warning was issued Trump stirred tensions even further saying the US is ready to fire at 52 Iranian sites including those of cultural importance to the Iranian people if Tehran moves to avenge the murder of Soleimani which was denounced by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as “an act of international terrorism.” Like this story?

138,The attack was on Camp Simba naval base in Manda Bay in Lamu County on Kenya’s coast bordering Somalia. Lamu County Commissioner Irungu Macharia told the Daily Nation local newspaper that “heavily armed” militants stormed the compound at 4am local time. Witnesses heard gunfire coming from the base Photos and videos circulating on social media allegedly show smoke billowing from the site. The spokesperson for the Defense Ministry Colonel Paul Njuguna later said that the attackers tried to seize the Manda airstrip near the base but were repulsed. Four militants were killed he stated as quoted by the Standard. There were no immediate reports of casualties among the personnel at the base or civilians. Established in 2004 Camp Simba is used by the US to train Kenyan naval units and is believed to play an important role in American operations in Somalia and Yemen including drone strikes. Kenyan troops participate in the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) which is aimed at supporting the Somalian government in its fight against Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab often carries out terrorist attacks in Kenya. In December militants ambushed a bus in the northern part of the country killing 11 people including seven police officers. One of the bloodiest attacks happened in 2013 when the group stormed a high-end shopping mall in Nairobi the nation’s capital killing more than 60 people mostly civilians.

142,"The solemn procession began at 7am at the Rumi Square in Ahvaz the capital of Iran's western Khuzestan Province which borders Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of black-clad mourners have completely filled both the streets and a bridge over the Karun River to pay their last respects to the major general.  Many are carrying photos of Soleimani who Iranian media has dubbed ""the Commander of Hearts."" Soleimani's remains along with those of several other Iranian officials killed in a US drone strike on Friday morning arrived in Ahvaz from Iraq where similar processions took place in Baghdad and Karbala the home of a Shia holy site. The caskets draped with Iranian flags were met by the local governor and clerics. According to the Mehr News Agency Soleimani is especially revered in Khuzestan because as a young man he participated in the defense of the region from the Iraqi invasion in the early days of the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988). Similar farewell processions are set to be held in several other cities including Tehran before Soleimani's funeral takes place in his hometown of Kerman on Tuesday. Soleimani who led the Quds Force – Iran's elite unit tasked with operations abroad – for more than 20 years was killed by a US drone shortly after leaving Baghdad's airport on Friday morning. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis the deputy chief of Iran-backed Iraqi Shia militias the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) died alongside Soleimani. The remains of al-Muhandis who was an Iranian citizen were also transported to Iran on Sunday. The US said that the killing of the Quds leader has prevented several major terrorist attacks against US army personnel and civilians. Tehran meanwhile branded Soleimani's death as a terrorist act by Washington and vowed to retaliate. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

143,Facing promises of retaliation for the killing of a popular Iranian general whose death he ordered personally Donald Trump threatened in no uncertain terms to escalate the conflict further. He said that if Tehran fails to turn the other cheek the US will hit 52 Iranian sites of great value. Hours later the US president returned to Twitter to brag about the amount of money the US military has received for equipment under his watch. “We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World!” he tweeted going on to promise that if attacked the US “will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way.” Friday’s targeted assassination of Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s Quds Force marked a sudden and rapid escalation of Washington’s stand-off with Iran. The US military claims the Iranian general approved an attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American. The Trump administration also justified the airstrike by accusing Soleimani of preparing an imminent attack on American citizens. Stocks of US defense contractors rose in the wake of the killing as investors predicted that there will be no shortage of US taxpayers’ money going their way if as Trump threatened their products are headed for Iran.

144,Following a speech delivered by Speaker Ali Larijani the MPs rose from their seats and gathered in the center of the hall to chant the anti-American slogan which is popular in Iran. “Mr. Trump this is the voice of the Iranian nation” Larijani said. The Iranian legislators are among hundreds of thousands outraged by the targeted assassination of Soleimani who was one of the most popular figures in Iran. His body was delivered on Sunday from Iraq where he was killed by a US airstrike on Friday morning. ‘Death to America’ is a slogan popularized during the 1979 revolution which ousted the US-backed Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Critics of Tehran see it as a literal call to kill Americans while Iranian officials say the chant expresses opposition to Washington’s aggressive and disruptive foreign policy. The phrase can also be translated as ‘down with America’. If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/news/477503-iran-parliament-death-america/,None
145,"Trump is a 'terrorist in a suit'. He will learn history very soon that NOBODY can defeat 'the Great Iranian Nation &amp; Culture' Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi tweeted on Sunday while also comparing the US president to Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) Adolf Hitler and Mongolian conqueror Genghis Khan. The minister was responding to an earlier tweet by Trump in which he warned that the US has ""targeted 52 Iranian sites"" including those important to ""the Iranian culture"" that will be hit if Tehran attacks American citizens or assets. Iran's army chief Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi rebuffed the warning however saying it is ""unlikely that the US would have what it takes to carry out its threat."" Meanwhile Tehran summoned the Swiss envoy to the Islamic Republic to protest Trump's hostile remarks. Such aggressive language is ""completely unacceptable and violates international law"" the Iranian Foreign Ministry said. Swiss diplomats act as intermediaries between Tehran and Washington because the countries cut formal ties in 1980. Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated dramatically in recent weeks. On December 27 dozens of rockets hit K-1 Air Base in Iraq killing an American civilian contractor and wounding several servicemen. Washington blamed Iran-backed Shia group Kataib Hezbollah for the attack and conducted airstrikes on its sites in Iraq and Syria. In response to the raids the group's members and supporters staged a large protest outside the US embassy in Baghdad which ended with the protesters breaking into the compound and partially setting it on fire. On Friday morning a US drone strike killed the chief of Iran's Quds Force – an elite unit tasked with operations abroad – Major General Qassem Soleimani. The attack also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis deputy commander of the Iran-backed Shia militia the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). Tehran has harshly condemned the raid while the US claims that Soleimani's death prevented several major terrorist attacks against American nationals. The Islamic Republic’s envoy to the United Nations has asked the UN Security Council to condemn the “horrific assassination” of the Quds Force leader.

146,Users are supposedly not allowed to threaten violence or glorify acts of violence on Twitter. And many people believe US President Donald Trump did just that when he threatened to attack 52 Iranian sites including some of cultural significance on his Twitter account. They are calling on Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend the man in the White House for breaking the rules.  Trump’s threat follows a warning of retaliation from Iran for the targeted assassination of one of its most prominent generals which was carried out on Friday on the US president’s orders. The move marks a rapid escalation of tensions between Washington and Tehran. The news of the death of Qassem Soleimani was met with much anxiety online with hashtags related to a possible World War 3 trending globally on Twitter throughout Friday. The website of the US Selective Service System even reported service problems amid rumors of an imminent draft. While it’s highly unlikely that Twitter will make the dreams of Trump critics come true and cut off the president it seems to have done some work on managing the public debate over how to proceed. Journalist and author Yasha Levine reported that Twitter algorithms forced him to remove an image saying “No war on Iran” in block capitals and several other users said it happened to them too. Levine somewhat proudly called himself a repeat offender. A vocal critic of Silicon Valley and its cooperation with the US intelligence community he was temporarily suspended by Twitter last month for a sarcastic take on Washington’s Ukraine policy. Anti-war sentiment raged not only on Twitter but also on the streets as thousands of US citizens staged protests against the escalation of violence in several large cities on Saturday.

147,Raab went on the BBC to fully endorse Washington’s justification of the targeted assassination of the commander of Iran’s Quds Force as an act of self-defense. The Trump administration claimed the man was planning attacks on American citizens and that preemptively killing him on Iraqi soil was OK. “It was General Soleimani’s job description to engage proxies militias across not just Iraq but the whole region not just to destabilize those countries but to attack Western countries who were legitimately there” the top British diplomat told Andrew Marr. “In those circumstances the right of self-defense clearly applies.” Soleimani was a crucial figure in organizing military support of the governments of Syria and Iraq in their fight against Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS). The Sunni terrorist organization grew out of an Iraq-based off-shoot of Al-Qaeda that gained strength on the chaos and smuggled weapons pumped into Syria by nations bent on toppling the Syrian government before overrunning US-trained Iraqi troops in the 2014 lightning offensive. The US and a coalition of its allies including Britain too fought IS on both sides of the border. Noticeably the fighting in Syria was done without a mandate of the UN Security Council and in blatant disregard for the opinion of the government in Damascus. American troops remain in the east of the country controlling oil fields and denying access to Syrians. In the drive to vilify Soleimani US President Trump branded him as the “number one terrorist anywhere in the world” – a title presumably ‘bestowed’ on the man after the killing of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi last October. Vice President Mike Pence went further and falsely accused the Iranian general of having a hand in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Soleimani’s actual record is quite complicated and includes for example assisting the US in their fight against the Taliban before George W. Bush put Iran on his  “axis of evil” list.

148,"The non-binding resolution instructs the government to cancel a request for military assistance from the US-led coalition which was issued in response to the rise of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS). With IS supposedly defeated Iraq will not need foreign troops to fight the jihadists and can close its airspace to coalition aircraft. According to Press TV some Western military presence may remain for training purposes. The resolution says Iraqi military leadership has to report the number of foreign instructors that are necessary for Iraqi national security. At the same time the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said that Baghdad had turned to the UN Security Council with complaints about US violations of its sovereignty. Speaking at an emergency parliament session on Sunday Iraq’s caretaker PM Adil Abdul Mahdi said the American side notified the Iraqi military about the planned airstrike minutes before it was carried out. He stressed that his government denied Washington permission to continue with the operation. Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s Quds Force and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis the deputy commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Force were killed by a drone strike as their convoy was leaving Baghdad International Airport on Friday morning.Mahdi said Soleimani was on his way to meet him. The interim prime minister said after the incident it was clear that it was in the interest of both the US and Iraq to end the presence of foreign forces on Iraqi soil. Responding to the move the Trump administration has expressed “disappointment” over the outcome of the vote by the Iraqi MPs. State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus urged Baghdad to reconsider taking into account ""the importance of the ongoing economic and security relationship” between Iraq and the US. The decision by the Iraqi Parliament is an “enormous development” not only for the country but for the whole region political analyst and journalist Andre Vltchek believes but removing foreign troops might be more difficult.  “We never saw the US army to depart just because the parliament of the occupied country would vote that it should. So this is not going to be easy for Iraq to get rid of the US and NATO military” Vltchek told RT. Washington is likely to “do all sorts of tricks” to try and stay in Iraq. For instance the US might “move the troops to Iraqi Kurdistan – as they did in the past.” Still the situation in the region now is different Vltchek added and the death of Soleimani may have become a unifying moment for it – at least for the countries and groups that maintain certain relations with Iran. Influential Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr stated in a letter that Iraq should go further and shut down the US embassy. Washington claims the assassination of Soleimani was an act of self-defense justified by his planning of attacks on American citizens. Tehran called it international terrorism and vowed to avenge the popular military officer. In the wake of the attack the US advised all American civilians to leave Iraq. US-led coalition troops in Iraq have also suspended all training operations and hunkered down at fortified bases bracing for retaliatory strikes.

149,A frustrated Masako Mori announced on Sunday that she had instructed the nation’s immigration services “to coordinate with related agencies to further tighten departure procedures.” “It is clear that we do not have records of the defendant Ghosn departing Japan” Mori said stressing that the former chairman and CEO of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance jumped bail and traveled from the airport in Osaka to Beirut Lebanon by using “some wrongful methods.” Mori also confirmed that Ghosn’s bail had been revoked after which Interpol had issued a non-binding ‘wanted’ notice to detain the fugitive on Tokyo’s request.  In Japan Ghosn is charged with embezzlement and lying about the size of his salary to shareholders. He was arrested and sacked from his positions then released on bail and placed under house arrest. He fled Japan on December 29 and reached Beirut via Istanbul the next day. Many details of the businessman’s daring escape remain unclear. There were reports that he managed to ditch surveillance by being smuggled out in a large box for musical instruments. However investigative sources later told Japanese public broadcaster NHK that surveillance footage had actually shown Ghosn leaving his Tokyo home and never returning. Furthermore citing sources Sankei newspaper reported on Saturday that the ex-CEO fled on the day when a private security company hired by Nissan stopped monitoring Ghosn because his lawyers threatened the firm with a lawsuit. Japanese media also reported that the escape was aided by a former Green Beret with experience in extracting hostages. The businessman who is a Brazilian French and Lebanese national reportedly left on a private jet using his spare French passport. Ghosn who denies the allegations against him explained that he chose to flee Japan because he does not trust the “rigged” local justice system. Although shocked by Ghosn’s escape his chief lawyer Takashi Takano said the authorities violated his client’s right to see his wife and that Ghosn was worried about not getting a fair trial due to the prosecutors’ leaks to the media and had feared that the legal process may take years. Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan. Lebanese caretaker Justice Minister Albert Serhan told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper that the country has no plans to hand over Ghosn despite having received a notice from Interpol asking them to detain him. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor’s Office meanwhile stated on Sunday that the ex-CEO “knowingly flouted” Japan’s judicial procedures while his “abundant financial power and multiple foreign bases” made it easy for him to flee the country. The prosecutors maintain that Ghosn must be detained to order to ensure “fair and appropriate criminal proceedings” and there is a “realistic danger” of him destroying evidence in the case.

150,Reading a prepared statement to his cabinet on Sunday Netanyahu lauded the importance of a subsea gas pipeline that will connect Israel with Cyprus and Greece. A trilateral agreement on the project was signed during his trip to Athens this week. “The significance of this project is that we are turning Israel into a nuclear power” he said before quickly correcting himself to say “energy power” and acknowledging his mistake with a smile.    Israel is estimated to hold about 90 nuclear warheads in its arsenal and a wide range of delivery systems. It is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which only recognizes five nuclear powers – the US Russia China Britain and France. In that regard Israel is in the company of India Pakistan and North Korea. The gaffe coming from the seasoned politician was seized by his critics online who mocked Netanyahu. The prime minister is currently fighting for political survival facing corruption charges and the third snap general election since April 2019.

151,"The US will continue to “respond with lawful strikes” targeting “actual decision makers” if it perceives a danger to any American targets the secretary of state said. The remarks came as he continued to defend the assassination of Iranian Quds Force commander Major General Qassem Soleimani which was ordered by President Donald Trump. Pompeo maintained that Washington had “all the authority” to do what it had done but added that the White House would keep Congress informed about developments in the Middle East from now on. His view on the “legality” of the American strikes on Iraqi soil was clearly not shared by Baghdad which even filed a formal complaint over the incident with the UN secretary general and the UN Security Council. He also argued that the killing of Soleimani which sent shockwaves across both Iran and Iraq with thousands of people hitting the streets to mourn the slain general and condemn the measures taken by the US was still the best course of action. ""The intelligence assessment made clear that no action - allowing Soleimani to continue his plotting and his planning his terror campaign - created more risk than taking the action that we took last week"" the state secretary told ABC’s ‘This Week’. In an apparent attempt to calm things down a bit Pompeo also said that he had “no doubt” the Iranian leadership “understands” Trump’s view of the situation and “gets the message clearly.” So far however the attack has only raised hostilities between Washington and Tehran to a whole new level. Iran called the American strike “an act of international terrorism” and vowed revenge. Both sides are now trading threats with a senior commander of Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards Corps claiming that up to 35 “vital” US and Israeli targets are within Iran’s reach while Trump threatened to strike 52 Iranian sites should Tehran follow up on its revenge plans - adding later that “brand new” American military hardware worth trillions of dollars would head Iran’s way in the event of retaliatory action.

Non-meat eaters could opt for just an egg and cheese McMuffin. The trouble was the app went down for many which led to a storm of upset customers taking to social media. Some even posted pictures from their phones showing the app was not giving them the deal that was promised or simply telling them the system was dealing with technical difficulties. Others expressed outrage of a different kind perplexed that people could get worked up over a breakfast sandwich while so many in the world deal with life-threatening situations. “Australia is ablaze; The US president is starting a war with Iran; but hang on...

154,Iraqi resistance will not let a single US soldier stay in Iraq after the killing of the Iranian Quds force commander Nasrallah said in a televised speech on Sunday. The Hezbollah leader however warned against harming any American civilians as such acts will only play into the hands of US President Donald Trump adding that every US military asset and serviceman in the region is fair game. “When the coffins of American soldiers and officers begin to be transported ... to the United States Trump and his administration will realize that they have really lost the region and will lose the elections” Nasrallah said. Expulsion of the US from the whole Middle East is a fair price for the murder of Soleimani and other officials Nasrallah said issuing a rather grim threat to the US military. The suicide bombers who had forced America to leave before are still there – and now they are greater in numbers he added. Avenging the deaths of Soleimani and other high-ranking Iranian and Iraqi military officials including Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis the deputy commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Force (PMF) militia is the responsibility of not only Iran but of all its allies in the region. Nasrallah urged all the members of the so-called 'Resistance Axis' to make up their minds on how they will deal with the assassination.

155,"Iran’s nuclear program “no longer faces any operating restrictions” a government statement cited by Iranian media said adding that parameters of enrichment capacity enrichment level and the amount of enriched material would from now on be determined only by the program’s “technical needs.” Tehran still vowed to continue its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and said that it could potentially return to fulfilling its obligations under the nuclear deal if sanctions imposed by Washington are lifted and Tehran’s interests are respected. The move marks the fifth and the final step in Tehran’s gradual scaling down of its commitments under the deal. The measure was taken in response to America’s unilateral exit from the agreement last year which was followed by its reissuing of crippling sanctions against Iran. Washington’s European allies desperately sought to preserve the deal struck in 2015 between Iran France Germany the UK and the US as well as Russia and China. Europe even attempted to create a special-purpose vehicle called INSTEX intended to help European companies trade with Iran without fear of repercussions in the form of sanctions from across the Atlantic. It turned out to be not particularly effective however as the European companies appeared to be in no rush to trade with Iran through fear of losing American market. Tehran repeatedly criticized Europe for failing to fulfil its commitments under the accord. It’s high time for Europe to make itself clear on the matter and either side with Washington or make a decisive push to salvage the beleaguered deal Ammar Waqqaf Middle East analyst told RT. “Iran is now pushing Europe towards the edge in terms of having either rescue the nuclear deal and part ways with America or probably ditch the deal altogether but it won’t be an Iranian call it would probably be a European call” Waqqaf said arguing that Europeans “have to act now.” Despite the current flare-up Tehran leaves the door open for compromise and the ball is now in the US court he said. “We are still hearing voices coming out from Tehran saying “guys we are happy to de-escalate and call it off should you lift sanctions.” The tensions between Iran and the US can spiral into a military conflict considering the both countries “are on the edge both have capabilities and both of them can hurt each other” Ahmed Rushdi President of House of Iraqi Expertise Foundation noted expressing hope that Tehran ""won't take a harsh decision"" and would pursue a “balanced” approach in handling the crisis.

157,The Turkish military has already started moving “slowly” towards Libya Erdogan revealed late Sunday. The scope of Ankara’s involvement in the years-long conflict is still unknown. The deployment of Turkish troops was greenlighted by the country’s parliament on Thursday. The move followed a request for military assistance by Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj who heads the UN-backed Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA). The GNA is entangled in a years-long conflict with another body claiming to be the real government of the shattered country – the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR). The HoR is supported by a major military force – Libyan National Army (LNA) led by strongman Khalifa Haftar. The LNA launched a large assault against the GNA early in 2019 reaching the outskirts of Tripoli but failing to actually storm the capital. The offensive seemingly picked up pace back in December when Haftar announced a new push for the capital. Turkey’s decision has drawn the ire of the GNA’s rivals – Haftar declared ‘jihad’ against Turkey vowing to throw the “invaders” out of the country. The HoR stuck to more conventional diplomatic actions officially cutting all ties with Ankara and accusing the rival PM of treason. Turkey is playing a high-stakes game in Libya with very little chance of success Ayo Johnson journalist and founder of Viewpoint Africa told RT noting that the promise of control over Libya’s vast oil and natural gas resources is too tempting for Ankara to not give it a shot even though Haftar “has the swing of the pendulum” and can take Tripoli “at a moment’s notice.” “When you are talking about oil when you talking about natural gas the sort of volume the largest we’ve seen on the African continent you can understand why so many actors and players are at play.” Although the US has not openly sided with either of the two rival Libyan governments urging all parties to show restraint and sounding the alarm over Russia’s growing influence in the region Johnson said he believes the Turkish offensive will come in handy for the US. “I understand from the sources I’ve been in contact with that they are already supporting the Turkish effort to be in Libya just to make sure that Russians and other supportive factions on the other side do not [lay] claim to that land in any shape or form” Johnson said. Still he said he believes the odds that the GNA will prevail are miniscule despite being backed by the UN. “I think [GNA PM Fayez Mustafa] al-Sarraj has a factional opportunity of winning but it’s going to be very difficult… I cannot see physically how which is why he has been propped up and supported by the Turks.” Think your friends would be interested?

158,Three ‘Katyusha’ unguided rockets struck central Baghdad the Iraqi military confirmed in a statement. Two of them fell in the Green Zone not far from the US embassy. One more hit the neighboring district of Jadriya. There have been no reports of any casualties or damage resulting from the attack. It is the second such incident targeting the Green Zone in just a few days since a top Iranian commander was killed on orders from Washington. On Saturday at least two rockets also hit the area not far from the American diplomatic mission. Mortar shells also landed in a nearby city district injuring five people at that time. A military base located north of Baghdad and hosting some US forces was also targeted in a separate rocket attack on Saturday but there were no casualties. The incidents come after Major General Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force was killed in a US drone strike alongside a deputy commander of an Iraqi Shia militia and a dozen other people. The strike sent shockwaves across both Iran and Iraq where thousands of people took to the streets to mourn the dead and condemn Washington’s actions. Tehran branded the general’s assassination “an act of terrorism” and vowed revenge. Iraqi Shia militia Kataib Hezbollah issued a warning to local security forces on Saturday implying more attacks are coming. It specifically said that people should stay away from US bases starting Sunday evening but stopped short of actually taking responsibility for the rocket attacks.

159,The injured are in a stable condition and are being evacuated at the moment the statement said. Camp Simba which hosts US and local troops came under attack on Sunday morning. The naval base is located in Manda Bay in Lamu County on Kenya’s coast bordering Somalia. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of our teammates who lost their lives today” US Army General Stephen Townsend said in the statement. The general promised to “pursue those responsible” for the attack and prevent Al-Shabaab jihadists from creating a “safe haven” in Africa.  The attack on the military base included “indirect and small arms fire.” Though the jihadists made it through the perimeter they were repelled by forces within the base. Six contractor aircraft vehicles were damaged “to some degree” in the attack.  Established in 2004 Camp Simba is used by the US to train Kenyan naval units and is believed to play an important role in American operations in Somalia and Yemen including drone strikes. Kenyan troops participate in the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) which is aimed at supporting the Somalian government in its fight against Al-Shabaab a jihadist group based in East Africa. In a recent attack the militant group ambushed a bus in December and killed 11 people including seven police officers. The US government designated al-Shabaab a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2008.  Think your friends would be interested?

160,A resolution calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops was adopted by the Iraqi parliament on Sunday. The non-binding document which the government is yet to consider came in response to the assassination of Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani as well as other Iranian and Iraqi military officials including the deputy commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The high-profile officials were killed in a US airstrike on the outskirts of Baghdad earlier this week. Washington appeared unnerved by the resolution. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the American military presence in the country insisting that the Iraqis actually support it. “We are confident that the Iraqi people want the United States to continue to be there to fight the counterterror campaign” Pompeo told Fox News Sunday. He apparently missed the part where the US actually attacked the Iraqi forces. The PMF militia which has been the key force in fighting Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) is part of the country’s military author and analyst Nicolas J.S. Davies said. “There’s now a confrontation between the Iraqi government and the US government. The US has already attacked Iraq’s armed forces that’s how this began” Davies told RT. “The Iraqi government has every right to ask them to leave and if the US resists this request then we have a huge confrontation.” The killing of Soleimani and his associates came not only in blatant disregard of international norms but breached the deal between Baghdad and Washington Davies said; thus the latest move by Iraq’s parliament is not very surprising. “The US is really just behaving like a rogue state at this point. All of it is just a flagrant violation of international law in so many ways” he said adding that US troops are there at the invitation of the Iraqi government. The parliament’s decision is an “enormous development” for the country which has moved a step closer to ending the enduring occupation as well as for the whole region political analyst and journalist Andre Vltchek believes. “We never saw the US Army depart just because the parliament of the occupied country would vote that it should. So this is not going to be easy for Iraq to get rid of the US and NATO military” Vltchek told RT. Washington is likely to employ “all sorts of tricks” to try and stay in the country he said. Transferring its forces into the autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan region “as they did in the past” is one way. Still the situation in the region has changed since the early stages of the 2003 invasion and the local powers and groups seem to be showing significantly more unity and the death of Soleimani could end up being a unifying moment. The whole endeavor to try and expel US troops from Iraq might still flop former Pentagon official Michael Maloof cautioned since the country’s politicians – including the caretaker PM who is spearheading the effort now – were very reluctant to actually do so before the US attack. “Prior to the assassination of General Soleimani there was dissent within these Shia ranks and that’s why you had no decision because for months there has been discussion of doing just this – possibly removing foreign troops namely the US in particular to avoid the very problem we’re having now” he said. The local forces have already been deemed capable of tackling the existing terrorist threat on their own – and now the US troops are “basically booted out” instead of departing after an accomplished mission Maloof said. “Now the question is – if ordered out will the US forces leave? … If they do not then they’ll become an occupying force once again.” Like this story?

This time however he did not just issue another threat but also said that the US Congress should follow his Twitter to keep up with the latest developments of this potentially explosive situation. “These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target the United States will quickly &amp; fully strike back &amp; perhaps in a disproportionate manner” Trump tweeted. “Such legal notice is not required but is given nevertheless!” The US State Secretary Mike Pompeo told ABC’s ‘This Week’ earlier on Sunday that although Washington had “all the authority” to strike the Iranian general it would try and keep Congress informed about its plans from now on. He never mentioned it would be done in the form of Twitter feed though. Trump himself has meanwhile been busy issuing threats to Tehran after Iran called the killing of Qassem Soleimani the commander of the elite Quds Force an “act of international terrorism” and vowed revenge. The US president warned that 52 Iranian targets including some apparently important cultural sites could be hit in a retaliation strike should Tehran follow up on its revenge plans. Pompeo later denied this statement. Trump also said that “brand new” American military hardware worth trillions of dollars would head Iran’s way in the event of retaliatory action. Back at home Trump was heavily criticized by the Democrats including senators and 2020 hopefuls Joe Biden Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders as well House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who is leading the impeachment process against him. They all warned it would bring Washington closer to war with Tehran. Trump’s Republican allies on the contrary welcomed the move and sided with the president and the secretary of state in calling it a preemptive defensive. Like this story?

162,This week the court will hear a case brought by the mother of a 15-year-old patient at the Tavistock Clinic in Leeds  – identified only as “Mrs. A” – and Sue Evans who worked there as a mental health nurse between 2003 and 2007. Both accuse the state-sponsored child gender reassignment center of providing an “inaccurate and potentially misleading” picture about the risks of such life-changing treatment to their young patients and their parents.  The plaintiffs argue that such medical intervention cannot be performed with only a child’s consent claiming that the clinic’s patients cannot fully comprehend the consequences of such life-changing decisions. “We are essentially seeking to say that the provision at the Tavistock for young people up to the age of 18 is illegal because there isn’t valid consent” said Paul Conrathe a lawyer representing the plaintiffs. Such treatment should not be delivered “as a matter of general approach” but instead should require a court order in each case he told the Guardian. The Tavistock Clinic’s methods have already attracted controversy particularly due to the criticism of its Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) by former employees who accuse it of “over-diagnosing” children with gender dysphoria to subject them to what some are calling risky and experimental treatment. As many as 35 psychologists have resigned from GIDS over the last three years with some of them raising concerns about the clinic’s practices. “Our fears are that young people are being over-diagnosed and then over-medicalized” one of them told Sky News in mid-December. “We are extremely concerned about the consequences for young people… For those of us who previously worked in the service we fear that we have had front row seats to a medical scandal.” The clinic generally treats children and teenagers under the age of 18. At least half of them are subjected to therapy that can have severe adverse health effects according to the Telegraph. First they are prescribed hormone-blockers that halt puberty and could generally slow normal physical development to supposedly give children “time to consider” if they really want to go through the transition process. The next stage is hormone therapy which leads to irreversible changes in the human body and eventually makes those taking hormones infertile while interfering with normal hormone production. Finally when patients reach the age of 18 they can go through gender reassignment surgery. The number of children going through GIDS has risen by a whopping 30 times over the last decade from 77 patients a year in 2008 to almost 3000 in 2018 according to the Tavistock Clinic’s own figures. Yet psychologists who used to work at the clinic warn that the center may be too eager to force a certain agenda instead of really dealing with the problems its patients have. “At the moment there’s only one pathway through the service which is a medical pathway not a psychological one” one of them told Sky News. Medical specialists who have left the clinic added that psychologists working there were kept under constant pressure because of fear of being called “transphobic.” “I didn’t feel able to voice my concerns or when I did I was often shut down by other affirmative clinicians” one of them told Sky. “Looking back there are young people who I now wouldn’t necessarily put on medication.” The GIDS which is controlled by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust brushed off concerns voiced by its former employees by saying that it supports every young person on a case-by-case basis as well as allows its specialists to discuss any case and “to engage openly and supportively with patients and parents.” The issues however may not be limited to just one clinic across the UK. In late December the Times reported that the number of children referred to a gender reassignment clinic in Glasgow Scotland has soared recently with referrals of patients aged between four and 10 skyrocketing by 80 percent in just over one year.  Trina Budge co-founder of local NGO forwomen.scot expressed alarm that children in Scotland might not receive sufficient support before being presented with the surgical option.  “Very vulnerable children who may be confused about their sexuality be autistic suffered trauma or have other co-morbid mental health conditions are at risk of being sent down an irreversible and experimental medical pathway when psychological support and talking therapy may be more appropriate” she said.

163,The goal of serving an en vogue meatless menu to guests before the televised ceremony is to “send a signal” about the potential dangers of climate change.  “If there’s a way we can not change the world but save the planet maybe we can get the Golden Globes to send a signal and draw attention to the issue about climate change” Hollywood Foreign Press Association president Lorenzo Soria said in a statement. “The food we eat the way we grow the food we eat the way we dispose of the food is one of the large contributors to the climate crisis.” Entree items include king oyster mushrooms scallops and wild mushroom risotto. Brussel sprouts and carrots will also be served and a golden beet soup will be the evening’s appetizer.   There is no official word on whether the food was produced locally or what was used to deliver it but Matthew Morgan executive chef at The Beverly Hilton which is where the ceremony takes place said the dishes were already mostly available. They were simply vegan options in the past and Morgan simply enhanced the dishes for the new slimmer menu. The red carpet at the event will also be reused at other events and water will be served in reusable glass bottles.  The decision to change the menu was made two weeks before the telecast was set to air. Climate change activist and actor Leonardo DiCaprio — who is up for the Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy award for his work in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood — praised the HFPA on Twitter for their climate friendly decision. Others were not so celebratory of the decision and saw it as an example of empty and hypocritical activism out of Hollywood considering the Golden Globes will still take a toll on the environment thanks to the many after-parties and gas-fueled limousine rides to and from the ceremony. “This will stop all of China’s pollution good job everybody” commentator Dana Loesch tweeted. “It will be interesting to see what modes of transportation will be used to travel to said event... Golden Globes meals going meatless to raise environmental awareness” The Hill reporter Joe Concha added.  “It’d be even more environmentally friendly if they just tweeted a list of winners” another user wrote. Hollywood award ceremonies are often platforms for virtue-signaling politics. Last year many celebrities attended the Golden Globes wearing Time’s Up pins in support of the #MeToo movement which affected many people within the industry. Both men and women wore the pins including actor James Franco who has faced several allegations of sexual misconduct.  That same year many female guests wore black outfits to protest the apparent power imbalance in the industry between men and women. “I think people are aware now of a power imbalance and it's something that leads to abuse it has led to abuse in our own industry. We want to fix that and we feel emboldened in a thick black line dividing then from now” actress Meryl Streep who wore black to the ceremony told Harper’s Bazaar.

164,“We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that’s there. It cost billions of dollars to build long before my time. We’re not leaving unless they pay us back for it” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. The punitive measures that the US is ready to slap on its supposed ally in the fight against Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) will be even harsher than the crippling sanctions already in effect against Tehran the president said. Trump’s warning to Iraq comes after Iraqi MPs passed a non-binding resolution championed by the country’s caretaker prime minister asking the Iraqi government to expel foreign troops by cancelling a request for military assistance from the US-led coalition. The resolution adopted earlier on Sunday envisions that some foreign troops might stay in Iraq for training purposes but the number of foreign instructors deemed necessary should be reported back by the Iraqi authorities. Trump also doubled down on his threat to wipe out Iranian cultural sites in retaliation for potential future attacks from Tehran which has vowed to avenge the assassination of its top general Qassem Soleimani by the US. Accusing Iran of “torturing” and “maiming” American soldiers in suicide attacks and by planting roadside bombs Trump hinted that attacks on US troops justify potential war crimes – the destruction of a nation’s cultural heritage. “They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way.” Trump’s statement on Saturday that the US might fire upon 52 sites that are important to Iran’s people and culture has courted controversy in the US with many of the Trump administration’s critics noting that Washington would mimic the methods of its declared adversary Islamic State – which is notorious for damaging and destroying globally-significant cultural sites in Syria and Iraq. Tensions between the US and Iran have been mounting ever since a series of US airstrikes against the Shia Kataib Hezbollah militia in Syria and Iraq on December 29 killed at least 25 fighters triggering a siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad that saw demonstrators chanting “death to America” and setting checkpoints on fire. The US blamed the showdown at its diplomatic compound on Tehran and its “proxies.” On Thursday the US launched a drone strike at a convoy travelling near Baghdad International Airport killing Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Qassem Soleimani along with senior Iraqi militia leaders. The murder of Soleimani who played a key role in the fight against IS in Syria and Iraq has drawn outrage across Iran and Iraq with Tehran vowing to avenge the assassination calling it “an act of international terrorism.” Washington meanwhile insists that Soleimani was the mastermind behind a spate of attacks on American personnel including at the US Embassy and says he was plotting new assaults.

165,The opposition-led National Assembly changed guard on Sunday with the majority of lawmakers electing Luis Parra an MP from the centrist Justice First a party in opposition to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s United Socialist Party (PSUV). One of the absentees was US-backed opposition figurehead Juan Guaido the now ex-leader of the National Assembly who proclaimed himself the country’s ‘interim president’ a year ago. Guaido and a group of his henchmen were filmed attempting to climb a fence surrounding the legislature with uniformed security guards pulling them back. The video has spread like wildfire online and was picked up by mainstream media in the West which spun it as evidence of Guaido being barred from participating in the key parliamentary vote by the supposedly ‘sinister’ Maduro ‘regime.’ But there’s a twist. Other footage shows Guaido chatting with members of the National Guard and refusing to enter the premises unless his companions reportedly five other deputies who were stripped of parliamentary immunity pending criminal prosecution are allowed inside. After his plea was rejected Guaido reportedly raised hell and attempted to storm the building. After his gambit failed Guaido convened a parallel assembly at an office of the pro-opposition El Nacional newspaper. His supporters “re-elected” Guaido and ‘swore him in’ as the parliament’s leader proclaiming the recent National Assembly vote unlawful. Some say that Guaido had the newspaper’s office ready for the ceremony long before he threw his fit at the fence suggesting this was nothing more than a publicity stunt.  That didn’t stop some top political figures – like the US secretary of state and Bolivia’s self-declared interim president Jeanin Anez – from congratulating Guaido on his ‘re-election’ while taking aim at Caracas for allegedly impeding his access to the building. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza denounced the stunt as yet another attempt by the US “to impose fake governments” after the “resounding failure” of its “coup strategy” in 2019.

166,“We promise to continue martyr Soleimani’s path with the same force... and the only compensation for us would be to remove America from the region” Esmail Qaani said on Monday in an interview to local media ahead of the general’s funeral in Tehran. Qaani was appointed new leader of the Quds Force – the secretive arm of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – on January 3. His comments come just days after General Gholamali Abuhamzeh who heads the IRGC in Iran’s southern Kerman province said 35 US targets in the region as well as Tel Aviv were identified “long ago” and are “within our reach.” Washington responded with a similarly-worded message with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threatening “lawful strikes” targeting “actual decision makers” if any American asset is in danger. As the war of words escalated the Pentagon ordered 3000 troops into the region. Meanwhile Iraq’s parliament passed a resolution calling for the removal of foreign troops from the country. Quds Force commander General Soleimani was assassinated in a targeted US drone strike near Baghdad International Airport. His car was hit when local allies from Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) were driving him from the airport. After days of mourning he will be buried in his hometown Kerman on Tuesday.

167,“Crazy Trump don’t think that everything is over with my father’s martyrdom” Zeinab Soleimani said in an address broadcast on state television amid a mourning ceremony in Tehran. The US rejoiced at General Soleimani’s assassination earlier in the week with Trump saying it helped foil “imminent and sinister” attacks on US diplomats and personnel. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed the strike which killed Soleimani near a Baghdad airport also averted an unspecified “big action” that would have put “dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk.” Tehran called the killing “an act of terrorism” and vowed “a rigorous response” once Soleimani is laid to rest. Commemorative ceremonies for the general who led the Quds Force for over two decades since 1998 saw people stomping on and burning American and Israeli flags. Think your friends would be interested?

172,The US should not misuse its military power Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said during a press briefing on Monday. He also called on Washington and Tehran to show restraint and avoid an escalation of tensions in the wake of a US drone strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force. “Power politics are neither popular nor sustainable” Shuang added as quoted by Reuters. China has been highly critical of the targeted strike describing the assassination as a violation of international norms and deeply damaging to regional stability. In a telephone conversation with his Iranian counterpart Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Washington was “abusing force” and promised that Beijing will hold an objective and fair position in order to help improve the situation in the Middle East.

173,The first week of the year saw more bad news coming in with Iran saying it will cease sticking to limitations on enrichment levels of enrichment and the stock of uranium written down in the 2015 nuclear deal. The announcement apparently unnerved Germany one of the three European countries that have been trying to save the deal after Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to pull the US out of it in May 2018. “We will definitely talk to Iran again” Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Deutschlandfunk radio on Monday. He said Iran’s actions are “not consistent with the agreement” and could lead to a calamitous outcome. “No one wants Iran to come closer to obtaining nuclear weapons” the top diplomat stated. Maas added that “we as Europe” will make a contribution to ensure that every opportunity is used “to give diplomacy another chance.” As part of the 2015 accords Iran conceded to limit its nuclear activities especially enriching uranium – a key element used to produce a nuclear weapon – and allow international inspections in return for the lifting of sweeping economic sanctions. But Trump’s withdrawal from the deal saw Iran gradually scaling back its commitments under the agreement. Throughout 2019 it had been activating new centrifuges and enriching uranium to levels banned under the agreement. Tehran was expected to announce its latest stance on the agreement just before a US drone strike near Baghdad killed General Qassem Soleimani the longtime commander of the Quds Force the secretive part of Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.  The targeted assassination has raised the ire of Iraqi leadership who bluntly said it violated the country’s sovereignty. Local MPs passed a resolution calling for a complete withdrawal of foreign forces to which the White House responded by threatening penalties that would “make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.” To Maas such threats “are not helpful” given the tensions that flared up in the region. “I don't think that it is possible with threats to convince Iraq but with arguments” he told Deutschlandfunk.

174,In a letter to her Democratic colleagues Pelosi stressed that Congress had a “responsibility” to stop a “serious escalation” with Tehran that could endanger US diplomats and service members. She said the House will introduce a vote on a War Powers resolution later this week that aims to “limit the President’s military actions regarding Iran.” The bill “reasserts Congress’s long-established oversight responsibilities by mandating that if no further Congressional action is taken the Administration’s military hostilities with regard to Iran cease within 30 days.” The top-ranking Democrat said the resolution was necessary in order to reassert Congressional oversight over war powers especially since Trump did not consult lawmakers before carrying out a drone strike that killed Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force. Trump notified Congress on Sunday that he would “quickly and fully strike back and perhaps in a disproportionate manner” should Tehran strike “any person or target”. The US president also warned that “brand new” American military hardware worth trillions of dollars would head Iran’s way in the event of retaliatory action. Like this story?

175,The data released by the High Pay Centre think tank reveals that the average FTSE 100 chief executive is paid 117 times more than the median worker at £3.46m a year. By 5pm BST on January 6 bosses of the UK’s biggest companies will have hoovered up more than the £29559 annual salary earned by the median full-time employee. Tim Roache the general secretary of the GMB one of Britain’s largest unions branded the FTSE 100 CEOs as “fat cats” and hit out at the figures as “a source of national shame.”  Frances O’Grady general secretary of the TUC which represents the majority of trade unions insisted that the huge gap between the top and average earners in UK firms “tells you everything about how unfair our economy is.” O’Grady wants to see workers on pay committees and company boards to keep a check on the high salaries of top bosses. The pay gap issue between company bosses and workers has rumbled on over many years and is one that successive UK governments have failed to even acknowledge through policy until now. Over the next few months individual businesses with more than 250 staff will have to publish pay ratios between top earners and the rest of their staff in annual reports for the first time.

176,The remains of Qassem Soleimani the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force who was killed in a US air strike was flown to Tehran after a day of funeral processions in Ahvaz and Mashhad. Bodies of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis the deputy chief of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) and other “martyrs” who died alongside Soleimani in an American drone strike also arrived in the city.  On Sunday morning a sea of people dressed in black poured onto the streets of the capital with state media putting the number of mourners at “millions” although the number has yet to be verified.  Later in the day funeral prayers were conducted by the sitting Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in the unfinished grand mosque of Tehran named after Ayatollah Khomeini. Khamenei’s voice was sobbing as he recited verses from the Koran together with President Hassan Rouhani and top officials. Esmail Qaani who succeeded Soleimani as the commander of the Quds Force was also seen choking back tears as he knelt before Soleimani’s coffin which had been draped in the national flag. Men and women of all ages were also filmed crying while others were seen holding pictures of the late commander. Mourners passed his coffin over their heads with numerous “death to America” and “down with USA” chants heard in the crowds. Soleimani’s daughter Zeinab joined the cries of vengeance telling the crowds: “Crazy [Donald] Trump don’t think that everything is over with my father’s martyrdom.” She said that a “dark day” awaits the US and Israel after the death of her father. Monday’s procession saw a number of American and Israeli flags burned by furious mourners. Some in Iran’s leadership have used the most remarkable pictures from the ceremony to send a bold message to Donald Trump who called Soleimani Iran’s “terrorist leader.”  “Have you EVER seen such a sea of humanity in your life?” asked Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif adding that the “end of malign US presence in West Asia has begun.” Following Monday’s procession the general’s remains will be taken to Qom one of the holiest cities for Shia Islam before being buried in his hometown of Kerman on Tuesday.Soleimani a designer of Iran's clandestine and military operations overseas is the first dignitary in modern history to have received a funeral ceremony in several cities across Iran. The late general rose to prominence during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and was appointed chief of the Quds Force in 1998. He is also believed to have played a key role in Iran’s effort to fight Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) in Syria and Iraq. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

177,"Shortly before 7pm local time on Sunday locals noticed a rather foreboding cloud heading straight for the city of Rio Cuarto. Temperatures fell dramatically and darkness descended as residents fled the sudden downpour of hail and debris. The violent dust storm enveloped the city in minutes bringing with it downpours of up to 37mm of rain in some areas as well as hail. Nearby communities in Serrano and Buchardo experienced rainfall measuring 40mm. Unfortunate residents received only a vague warning of incoming ""isolated storms of varying intensity"" which might involve “powerful gusts heavy rainfall for brief periods of time intense electrical activity and hail."" Judging by eyewitness videos from Rio Cuarto the National Meteorological Service's more pessimistic predictions were spot on. The region had experienced temperatures of 30 degrees Celsius earlier on Sunday before things took a dark turn. There were widespread - but short-lived - power cuts owing to the extreme weather which included gusts of up to 120kph.  As one eyewitness video shows even in General Levalle 125 km from Rio Cuarto roofs were torn from buildings and nonchalantly launched into the air. Miraculously there were no fatalities or injuries despite Mother Nature throwing everything at the region in a short space of time. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

179,In the aftermath of the assassination of Iran’s Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani in a US drone airstrike near Baghdad International Airport on Thursday night Trump announced a number of threats against the Iranians via social media. In one such threat the US president talked about “targeting” Iranian sites the number of which represents the “52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago.”  However on Monday Johnson’s official spokesman insisted that “there are international conventions in place that prevent the destruction of cultural heritage.” He stopped short of saying the killing of Soleimani was a ‘war crime’ claiming instead “states have a right to take actions such as this in self-defense.” The US administration justified the action against the man widely regarded as the second most powerful figure in Iran – after the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – by claiming Soleimani was plotting imminent attacks against American diplomats and military personnel. In response to the killing the UK ordered its navy vessels to provide “protection” to all British-flagged ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf near Iran.

180,The removal of foreign military forces would prevent the US-led coalition from continuing its “vital work” countering Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) in Iraq a UK government spokesman argued. Iraq’s parliament passed the motion on Sunday following the US-ordered assassination of Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force in Baghdad. The resolution is non-binding and has not yet been adopted as an official law. The UK currently has an estimated 400 troops stationed in Iraq. London has defended President Donald Trump’s decision to use a targeted drone strike to kill Soleimani while also calling for restraint from both sides. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab reportedly told Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi that the Iranian general was a “regional menace” and said the United States had the “right of self-defense”. Trump has said US troops will not leave Iraq until Baghdad compensates Washington for military bases it has built since the start of the 2003 invasion. He vowed to impose crippling sanctions on Iraq if the US military is forced to leave on unfriendly terms. Like this story?

182,The team from Montana State University targeted dwarf galaxies which are 100 times less massive than our own Milky Way for study as these are the smallest known to possibly host black holes. Given the size of the galaxies it follows that their black holes would also be relatively small though still somewhere in the region of 400000 times the mass of our sun. The team began by surveying galaxies in the NASA-Sloan Atlas a catalog of readily visible galaxies before cross-referencing potential candidates with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) survey to form a candidate list of 111 galaxies.  Using the National Science Foundation's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) the team discovered 13 such black holes in dwarf galaxies less than a billion light years away. However these massive predatory black holes were found to be roving around their galaxies and consuming surrounding material such as stars planets and moons as opposed to remaining stationary at the galaxy’s center. This indicates that the galaxies likely merged with others in the past and leads to the rather terrifying conclusion that there may be far more black holes wandering out there than we thought consuming everything in their path.  “This work has taught us that we must broaden our searches for massive black holes in dwarf galaxies beyond their centers to get a more complete understanding of the population and learn what mechanisms helped form the first massive black holes in the early universe” said Amy Reines of Montana State University.

183,The rollback on uranium enrichment constraints detailed in the landmark international agreement “in itself poses no threat in terms of proliferation of nuclear weapons” the ministry said in a statement. The fact that Iran is acting in “close cooperation and under supervision” of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should eliminate all concerns it added. The Iranian move must be viewed in the context of the US’s unilateral withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 as well as the “massive onslaught” of sanctions imposed by Washington on Tehran and other signees (Russia China the UK France and Germany) which has been taking place since then. “The most important thing” was Iran’s eagerness to immediately return to full compliance after all of its “justified” concerns over other signees not fulfilling the terms of the deal are removed Moscow pointed out. Maintaining the nuclear agreement should remain a priority for all involved parties the ministry said adding that “a lot in this regard depends on our European partners.” Over the weekend Tehran announced the completion of the fifth and final step in its gradual scaling down of the commitments agreed under the 2015 deal. The country’s nuclear program “no longer faces any operating restrictions” it said adding that the level of uranium enrichment will from now on be solely determined by Iran’s own “technical needs”. Tehran and the IAEA both confirmed that international inspectors are continuing to work with Iran. Think your friends would be interested?

A note on the sex offender’s bed gripes about the conditions at New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC). Photos of Epstein’s body show a thin bloody line across the middle of his throat. According to former New York City Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Baden who observed the autopsy the wound is more consistent with murder than suicide. “This noose doesn’t match the ligature furrow mark. It’s wider than this” Baden told 60 Minutes. “Most hangings especially free hangings the ligature slides up to beneath the jawbone the mandible. Here it’s in the middle of the neck.” Epstein’s neck was fractured in multiple places including the hyoid a small bone near the Adam’s apple. “I have never seen three fractures like this in a suicidal hanging” Baden said adding “Going over over a thousand jail hangings suicides in the New York state prisons over the past 40 50 years no one had three fractures.” His injuries also included bruised wrists an abrasion on the arm a muscle injury to the shoulder an injury to the back of the neck and a cut on the lip. However it is unclear if any of these injuries were inflicted by hospital staff trying to resuscitate Epstein. New York’s chief medical examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson ruled Epstein’s death a suicide in August and stands by that decision. However that ruling did little to quiet speculation that the millionaire sex offender was murdered. Epstein’s connections to the rich and powerful – including Bill Clinton Donald Trump and British Prince Andrew – would likely have been brought up during his trial leading some to believe that these people had strong motive to silence Epstein. Epstein had pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing and trafficking multiple girls as young as 14. Back in 2008 a sweetheart deal with Florida prosecutors saw Epstein skate on similar charges serving just 13 months in a minimum-security facility. Speculation was further stoked when it was revealed that security cameras at the MCC allegedly malfunctioned on the night of Epstein’s death. In addition two prison guards who were supposed to check in on the high-profile prisoner every 30 minutes have been charged with conspiracy and falsifying records after it emerged that they slept through their shift on the night. Only one prisoner at MCC Philadelphia mobster Louis Turra has succesfully committed suicide in the last 40 years. Judge Richard Berman who presided over Epstein’s sex trafficking case said in November that it was “unthinkable” that an inmate as high profile as Epstein could die behind bars without guards noticing. Epstein was the only defendant in his case. With his death the case is shut and the alleged victims denied closure. However some of the alleged victims still carry on with civil cases against the deceased pedophile’s estate. Think your friends would be interested?

185,"Soleimani who commanded the Iranian military Quds Force was killed in an American airstrike last week an assassination which raised already high tensions between Washington and Tehran to boiling point. Democrats criticized Trump for ordering Soleimani’s killing prompting conservative satire site the Babylon Bee to put its own spin on events. “Democrats call for flags to be flown at half-mast to grieve death of Soleimani” read a headline from the site on Friday. ""As a nation we need to stop and grieve this great austere revered religious scholar. He was one of the good ones” the Bee parodied Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar as saying riffing on the description used by the Washington Post in its obituary for Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in October. “Later Democrats clarified they meant we should fly the Iranian flag at half-mast not the ‘offensive and problematic’ American flag” the article concluded. The article was shared more than 720000 times which didn’t go down well with CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan who claimed that it received the same number of engagements as the top New York Times and CNN stories over the past week. “A lot of people sharing this ‘satirical’ story on Facebook don’t know it’s satire” O’Sullivan tweeted before accusing the Babylon Bee of spreading “clickbait and misinformation” under the guise of satire. “Some family members just called bc their Republican friends on FB are circulating it like it's legit” former CIA analyst Cindy Otis chipped in. “We have a lot of work to do all.” “Someday I’m going to write a whole screed on ‘satirical/humor’ websites. Today however is not that day” Otis continued. Indeed the Babylon Bee’s brand of right-wing humor has annoyed liberal journalists before. Though positioning itself as a political satire outlet in the vein of the Onion the Bee has been ‘fact-checked’ by Snopes dozens of times. These fact checks saw the Bee threatened with demonetization by Facebook prompting the Bee to accuse Snopes of being “actively engaged in an effort to discredit and deplatform us.” In one case Snopes ran a fact check on the Bee’s obviously ludicrous claim that a new California law requires Christians to “register bibles as assault weapons” declaring it “false” for anyone lacking the common sense to figure that out for themselves - or anyone who missed the site’s footer which reads “The Babylon Bee is your trusted source for Christian news satire.” O’Sullivan was roasted on Twitter for his alarmist Twitter thread. “The only difference between Babylon Bee and CNN is that the Babylon Bee knows it’s a parody” wrote journalist Sean Davis. However satire often goes over the heads of its audience. China’s ‘People’s Daily’ was fooled by a 2012 Onion article declaring North Korean leader Kim Jong-un the “Sexiest Man Alive.” The People’s Daily reported the story as news before pulling the piece from its website. Iran’s Fars News Agency also fell for the Onion’s antics reposting an article claiming that 77 percent of rural Americans would “rather vote for Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad” than Barack Obama without realizing it was satire.

186,The new research conducted by German and Greek scientists and published in Science centers on signals sent and received by the ends of neurons known as ‘dendrites.’ The information passed by these parts of the brain is key to how the organ decides subsequent actions. Working with slices of human brain tissue the team found unexpectedly complex electrical activity in the dendrites of human pyramidal neurons. Modeling this activity then showed that single neurons were capable of solving computational problems which were thought to need a lot more brain power.  “The dendrites are central to understanding the brain because they are at the core of what determines the computational power of single neurons”said study co-author Matthew Larkum a neuroscientist at Humboldt University of Berlin. “There was a ‘eureka’ moment when we saw the dendritic action potentials for the first time.” Little is currently known about how dendrites operate in other species or if this kind of high-computational activity is uniquely human. However it’s incredibly difficult to record dendrite activity in humans or animals while they’re alive and Larkum says more research is needed to fill in these blanks.

187,Trump provoked widespread outrage with a tweet Saturday claiming that Washington had 52 Iranian sites in its crosshairs some of which were “very important” to “Iranian culture.” Those targets he added would be hit “very fast and very hard” if Tehran retaliated for the killing of top general Qassem Soleimani. Asked about the threat on Sunday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that Trump “didn’t say he’d go after cultural sites.” Probed during a separate appearance on ABC News about why Trump was “threatening Iran with war crimes” Pompeo said the administration would “behave lawfully” and “inside the system.” Yet hours after Pompeo’s comments Trump doubled down in comments to White House pool reporters: “They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way” he said. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway was also on damage control Monday saying Trump simply posed the idea as a “question” — though his original tweet explicitly states that cultural sites were among the US’ list of targets. Conway also seemingly attempted to preemptively spin any hits on cultural sites as legitimate by suggesting that Iran has many “strategic military sites” that are “also cultural sites.”  She later clarified that she did not mean to say that Iran was camouflaging its military targets within cultural sites according to Washington Post reporter Aaron Blake. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave a tepid warning against targeting Iran’s cultural heritage saying through a spokesman on Monday that “there are international conventions in place” intended to prevent that kind of destruction. Meanwhile UNESCO also told the US to stay away from Iran’s cultural heritage reminding Washington that it is party to treaties which explicitly prohibit the targeting of cultural sites during armed conflict.  Like this story?

189,Jury selection for Weinstein’s trial has begun and all eyes were on the one-time Hollywood titan as he hobbled into court on Monday seemingly trying to look older than his 67 years. Over 100 women have gone on the record accusing him of varying levels of sexual impropriety from unwanted advances to rape. Hundreds more however remained silent while he was allegedly preying on these women even though Weinstein’s behavior was one of the biggest “open secrets” in the industry. When Weinstein was finally indicted on five felony counts of sexual assault and rape in 2018 in New York the number of previously silent boldface names who admitted they had “heard stories” of the megaproducer’s “inappropriate” behavior was almost comical. Most in Hollywood expressed relief that he was finally being held to account but some continued to plead ignorance or even praise the mogul especially actors whose careers he’d launched or aided. Award-winning actors Meryl Streep and Matt Damon both insisted they hadn’t known about his casting couch antics though Damon himself was accused of helping to kill a story exposing Weinstein’s predation. Filmmaker Michael Moore called Weinstein “one of the best people to work with” in Hollywood in 2015; two years later he wasn’t just acting shocked at Weinstein’s sexual improprieties but demanding the industry introduce gender quotas on its boards to forestall future Weinsteins. Widespread awareness that Weinstein was hurting women didn’t stop anyone from working with him during the height of his career so long as that awareness remained confined to the industry. But Weinstein could not have operated without the consent of that industry which still viewed the “casting couch” concept - in which sex is exchanged for roles - as a normal and acceptable part of the business. NBC sitcom 30 Rock was mocking his sexual quid-pro-quos all the way back in 2012 while Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane’s own joke about the predatory producer at a 2013 Oscars event was met with raucous laughter suggesting the audience knew full well what he was talking about. That the allegations against Weinstein never “stuck” until recently was attributed to his legendary ability to “spin - or suppress – anything” with help from the large number of journalists on his payroll. He was also known to threaten anyone who tried to expose him and boasted of his ability to make or break an actor’s career. Some women (including actor Rose McGowan one of his most vocal accusers) were paid off with settlements and employees were silenced with NDAs. It wasn’t until late 2017 that the #MeToo movement kicked off when Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan told their Harvey Weinstein stories - on the record - to the New York Times which published them along with a handful of similar accusations from lesser-known women. Former model Jasmine Lobe who claims to be among Weinstein’s victims told CBS on Monday that if the producer isn’t convicted he’ll be back at work in no time.  In addition to the New York state charges Weinstein was charged on Monday with sexual assault of two women in Los Angeles. The producer however has vowed he will be “fully exonerated” and return to work #MeToo or no #MeToo. And decades of silence from the industry prove that it’s not Weinstein’s predatory behavior that bothers Hollywood - merely the negative publicity from that behavior being exposed. Weinstein is not the only casting couch predator in the industry; he’s just the most recent one to be caught.

190,Citing “heightened tensions in the Middle East” the embassy urged Americans in Israel the West Bank and Gaza to “remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness” on Monday noting that rocket fire and other “security incidents” seldom leave much time to react. The memo advised Americans to learn the location of nearby bomb shelters and pay attention to alert sirens. The warning comes in the wake of a US strike that killed Iran’s highest-ranking military commander Qassem Soleimani along with several high-ranking individuals in Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units. Iraq’s Parliament has since voted on a resolution to expel foreign troops from the country while Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has called for attacks on US soldiers and military assets. Tehran has also vowed revenge over Soleimani’s killing which it called an “act of international terrorism.” Esmail Qaani his replacement at the head of Iran’s Quds Force has vowed to “remove America from the region.” Several rockets and mortars hit Baghdad’s Green Zone and surrounding areas over the weekend; five injuries were reported.

191,An unspecified number of additional forces will be joining US and Kenyan forces currently stationed at the base the Pentagon announced on Monday. AFRICOM has ruled out the possibility that Sunday’s attack was related to rising tensions between the US and Iran. One US soldier and two contractors died on Sunday when the militant group attacked in a four-hour pre-dawn raid that destroyed two planes two helicopters and several American military vehicles according to a Kenyan police report seen by Reuters. Fewer than 150 US personnel are currently stationed at the base where they are tasked with counterterrorism and training East African forces.

192,According to FBI data 28369750 background checks were performed in 2019 smashing the previous record of 27 million in 2016. The agency ran 202465 checks on Black Friday alone. The Christmas period was a festive one for firearms retailers with just under three million checks carried out in December the second-highest month since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System began in 1998. The number of background checks performed does not directly correlate with weapons sales the FBI cautioned. Some states for example carry out checks for concealed-carry permits for example and the figures don’t account for multiple weapons purchased at once. Nevertheless it is the most reliable indicator of nationwide gun sales that exists. Firearms sales typically spike when gun owners feel like their Second Amendment rights are threatened. Though President Trump has been a vocal proponent of gun rights his opponents spent 2019 pushing the opposite message.  Every Democratic candidate for next year’s election has promised to restrict gun rights in some manner with Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke proposing a mass confiscation of AR- and AK-style rifles in September shortly before dropping out of the race. O’Rourke’s fellow Democrats Joe Biden and Kamala Harris then announced that they too would introduce their own mandatory buyback schemes. The following month saw the third-highest number of checks in the whole year. “Americans are choosing to invest their hard-earned dollars in their ability to exercise their rights and buy the firearms they want before gun control politicians attempt to regulate away that ability” a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation told the Associated Press in December. Though violent crime has decreased by more than 50 percent since the early 1990s mass shootings continue to make gun control a headline issue in the US. Last year saw a number of high-profile slayings including two shootings in Texas in August that left 30 people dead a massacre in Virginia Beach that killed 13 and a bloodbath at a nightclub in Dayton Ohio that killed nine.

193,“Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290” Hassan Rouhani wrote on Twitter. “Never threaten the Iranian nation.” The US guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes shot down Iran Air Flight 655 with 290 crew and passengers on board over the Strait of Hormuz in July 1988. Washington said the jet didn’t respond to warnings and was identified as an Iranian warplane because of that. Back then Tehran blasted the US for its criminal negligence insisting that the Airbus A300 transmitted the signal which allowed it to be identified as a civilian aircraft. The Americans never admitted guilt or formally apologized to Tehran for the tragedy. However they paid almost $62 million in damages to the relatives of the victims almost a decade later. The number 52 in Trump’s tweet wasn’t pulled out of a hat either. It represents the number of diplomats who were taken hostage by revolutionary students at the US Embassy in Tehran in 1979. The Americans were held for 444 days but were eventually released after negotiations. The US president warned that sites “at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; the Iranian culture” will be hit in order to discourage Iran from retaliating for the assassination of the head of its elite Quds Force Qassem Soleimani. The killing of Soleimani in a US drone strike in Iraq last week has put the two nations on the brink of war. Millions across Iran took to the streets on Sunday to take part in the commander’s funeral shedding tears and shouting anti-American slogans. Think your friends would be interested?

194,"LATEST: ‘Not leaving Iraq!’ Pentagon chief clarifies ‘poorly worded’ US withdrawal plan sent by ‘mistake’ “In due deference to the sovereignty” of Iraq the Combined Joint Task Force Iraq will be “repositioning forces over the course of the coming days and weeks to prepare for onward movement” Marine General William H. Seely III wrote in a letter to the Iraqi Defense Ministry on Monday which has surfaced online. “We respect your sovereign decision to order our departure” Seely wrote explaining that the process will involve increased helicopter traffic into and out of Baghdad’s “green zone” mainly during the night-time with the Coalition seeking to “minimize and mitigate” disturbances to civilians. There was initially some confusion about the letter's authenticity with the Pentagon declining to confirm it was real However US Army public affairs officer Rick Dickson stated shortly after the news broke that the letter is ""official and accurate."" The Iraqi parliament adopted a resolution on Sunday seeking to “end the presence of any foreign troops on Iraqi soil” prompted by last week’s US drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and a number of Iraqi Shia militia officials at the Baghdad International Airport.  US President Donald Trump responded by threatening sanctions and saying the US will not leave until the Iraqis “pay us back” for an airbase that he said cost billions of dollars to build. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo likewise dismissed the non-binding resolution saying that he was “confident that the Iraqi people want the United States to continue to be there to fight the counterterror campaign.” The US-led coalition forces were sent to Iraq in 2014 to help the government in Baghdad confront Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) terrorists that had taken a significant portion of Iraqi territory all of which has since been liberated.  Think your friends would be interested?

195,In a piece published on CNN's ‘Facts First’ blog Biden was scolded for “dishonestly” claiming he opposed the invasion of Iraq. The fact-check came after Biden told a voter in Iowa at the weekend that he was against the war “from the very moment” George W. Bush launched it. In reality Biden “repeatedly spoke in favor of the war both before and after it began” CNN wrote. The network called Biden's comment “highly misleading even under the most generous interpretation” given that the former VP was “actually a vocal supporter” of military action and voted to authorize Bush's use of force.  Indeed not only did Biden vote for the war a whole nine months later he said that he would “vote that way again.” On the very day the bombing began Biden said Americans should “step back and be supportive” of Bush — a far cry from his recent and disingenuous retelling of history in which he was against the disastrous invasion all along. Only after 2005 Biden started calling his vote a “mistake.” Biden’s continued insistence that he was against the war from the get-go is somewhat strange considering his own campaign acknowledged in September that he “misspoke” the last time he made similar false statements.  His camp has been understandably sensitive about his Iraq record and reluctant to directly respond to fellow 2020 contender Bernie Sanders’ efforts to point it out. So far many in the media have framed Sanders’ targeting of Biden on this subject as a political “attack” — despite it being a simple statement of fact. “Pointing out that Joe was pro Iraq war isn't an attack it's the goddamn truth” one Sanders supporter wrote on Twitter. However Biden tries to spin it to absolve himself of blame seventeen years later it won’t change the facts. He was a leading Democratic voice in favor of military action against Iraq and a crucial ally of the Bush administration in the lead up insisting repeatedly that Saddam Hussein must be removed from power.  Biden even ruled out diplomacy at one point saying that “dialogue with Saddam is useless.” The supposed anti-war Biden even praised Bush for “moderation and deliberation” and called Iraq a “just war” which he believed would lead to “peace and security.” He stood steadfast in his pro-war stance even as many in his own party were raising doubts. The media has often been reluctant to needle Biden on his Iraq War vote parroting his claims that he was “misled” by Bush and touting his foreign policy “experience” as an advantage in the 2020 election — but with even CNN calling Biden out on his record it looks like some in the mainstream media are beginning to grow tired of the lie.

196,The candidates got an unwitting makeover during the network’s Squawk Box program on Monday as the show was covering fourth-quarter fundraising totals. Yang’s face was replaced with a similarly-named Asian businessman founding partner of Redpoint Ventures Geoff Yang. Gabbard was replaced even more confusingly by New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand – once a primary candidate herself until she dropped out of the race in August. One could chalk both up to chance mistakes – Geoff and Andrew Yang have the same last name so perhaps their headshots are sequential in the network’s files? Gabbard and Gillibrand were sequential in the alphabetical list of candidates perhaps they forgot to remove the blonde decidedly un-Gabbard-like congresswoman when she called it quits six months ago? But the fact that both candidates each with a decidedly anti-establishment bent have been noticeably shafted by mainstream media in the past led their supporters to cry foul. Hardly anyone believed the “innocent mistake” hypothesis. “This has to be intentional malice” one user observed. “They’re so used to not covering them. Maybe none of their staff knew what they look like” deadpanned one user. Some called the switcheroo racist. “Imagine if it had been [Cory] Booker’s face with another black man. The left would be enraged.” Others took matters into their own hands. Between the #YangMediaBlackout – the outsider candidate has been repeatedly left off graphics poll results and other visual aids even when polling significantly higher than others shown – and the Groundhog Day-like attacks on Gabbard for meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2017 it’s easy to see how both candidates’ supporters might accuse mainstream media of wearing its bias on its sleeve. The network eventually apologized for the mistake and quickly fixed the graphic but not before several people had suggested the Yang campaign take legal action against them. Like this story?

197,Soleimani head of Iran’s elite Quds Force was the main target of Friday’s drone attack but the Americans apparently didn’t care about collateral damage. Among the 10 victims was not just the Iranian general – who Washington conveniently branded a terrorist – but also top Iraqi security officials who are technically supposed to be US allies. Al-Muhandis the deputy commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces and one of the most important military figures in the country was among those killed. Back in 2017 however he gave an interview to RT in which he said that “the new [US] administration is trying to start a war in the region and this is madness.” , https://www.rt.com/news/477601-iraq-iran-us-muhandis-soleimani/,None
198,Ocasio-Cortez considers herself “one of the most hated people in America” she told New York Magazine in an interview published on Monday. Since a surprise electoral victory over a 10-term incumbent Democrat in 2018 she’s since become the face of her party’s emboldened progressive wing alongside ‘The Squad’ of fellow Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib (Michigan) Ilhan Omar (Minnesota) and Massachusetts’ Ayanna Pressley. Ocasio-Cortez’s occasionally loose grip on the truth has made her a favorite punching bag of the Republican Party while her calls for sweeping healthcare climate and immigration reforms have earned rebukes from establishment Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who jested last summer that ‘The Squad’ live in “their Twitter world.” Speaking to New York Magazine Ocasio-Cortez highlighted this growing rift in the Democratic Party. “In any other country Joe Biden and I would not be in the same party but in America we are” she said. A supporter of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for the presidency Ocasio-Cortez cautioned her party of the dangers of running a moderate candidate like Biden. “And that’s exactly what happened to 2016” she said. “We picked the logically fitting candidate but that candidate did not inspire the turnout that we needed.” Among Democrats Ocasio-Cortez said there remains in place a belief that Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 election was based on her personality not her policies. Democrats “often think there was nothing wrong before Trump. They think Hillary was the problem. But it’s much deeper than that.” In attempting to unseat Trump Democrats have been criticized for focusing on their prospective candidates’ “electability” a nebulous term that boils down to which candidate presents the most palatable inoffensive message. Intra-party argument and debate bickering is therefore treated as dangerous when simply defeating Trump is the primary objective. “We’re a family and we have our moments” Pelosi told House Democrats at a meeting in July. “Without that unity we are playing completely into the hands of the other people.” “So the Democratic Party has a role to play in this problem” Ocasio-Cortez told New York Magazine. “It’s not like we’re allowed to talk about it. We’re not allowed to talk about anything wrong the Democratic Party does.” Against this background Ocasio-Cortez encouraged her fellow progressives in Washington to enforce stricter ideological purity rules. The Congressional Progressive Caucus for example does not require members to submit applications allowing anyone on Capitol Hill to identify as a progressive. “They let anybody who the cat dragged in call themselves a progressive. There’s no standard” she declared adding “Democrats can be too big of a tent.” If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/477602-aoc-interview-joe-biden-/,None
199,“There’s been no decision to leave Iraq. Period” Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday. He was referring to reports that the head of Combined Joint Task Force Iraq General William H. Seely III informed the Iraqi government of preparations to reposition the coalition forces “in due deference to the sovereignty” of Iraq. Meanwhile Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said that the letter Seely had sent was only a draft and that releasing it was a “mistake.” The Iraqi military confirmed receiving it however. Esper would neither confirm nor deny the letter’s authenticity though US Army public relations officials said earlier it was real. Instead he reiterated the position staked out earlier by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the Iraqi people “want the US to stay” and cited the rise in attacks by Iranian “proxy groups.” US President Donald Trump likewise rejected the withdrawal on Sunday threatening Iraq with sanctions and saying the US will not leave until the Iraqis “pay us back” for an airbase that he said cost billions of dollars to build. On Sunday the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution asking the government to disinvite all foreign troops – including the US-led coalition against Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) – after last week’s assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in a US drone strike outside Baghdad International Airport.  The resolution is non-binding but reflects the growing frustration in Baghdad with continued US operations in Iraq long after the official defeat of IS was proclaimed.

200,"“The assassination of Soleimani isn't an Israeli event but an American event. We were not involved and should not be dragged into it” Netanyahu reportedly told his security cabinet during a meeting on Monday as cited by Israel's Channel 13. He advised ministers to avoid speaking to the media about Thursday's targeted assassination beyond supporting the US' right to defend itself so as not to give the impression that Israel had played any role in it. The directors of Mossad and military intelligence reassured the ministers that the likelihood of a retaliatory attack is low since ""Israel stayed at a distance from the incident"" and that Iran will begin planning its reciprocal move on Tuesday following the conclusion of the national mourning period for Soleimani according to the same sources. Netanyahu’s sudden reticence is particularly notable because he has been advocating a US-Iran conflict for much of his political career. For over 20 years he has insisted that the Islamic Republic was just steps away from producing nuclear weapons even when Israeli intelligence publicly argued otherwise. The Israeli PM was also front and center in the run-up to the most recent Iraq War warning the US Congress in 2002 that Saddam Hussein had ""weapons of mass destruction"" – including pursuing atomic bombs – which turned out not to exist at all. Just last year Netanyahu was urging the US and its Middle Eastern allies to take up the cause of war against Iran emboldened by US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal and re-impose crippling sanctions against Tehran despite its compliance with the agreement. However the overt US killing of a military commander who was apparently very popular in Iran has provoked serious talk of retribution not just in Tehran but among Hezbollah – the Lebanese Shia militia that boasts of fighting Israel to a draw in 2006 – as well. Netanyahu has had a tough 2019 clinging onto the post of PM in a purely technical mandate after two elections mere months apart delivered a hung Knesset and required an unprecedented third coming this spring. Talking a tough game against Iran in order to get Israeli votes is one thing but facing the real possibility of being the target of Iranian missiles is apparently quite another. Like this story?

201,At least 30 trainees were killed and another 33 injured in the Saturday strike health officials of the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) said noting the total death toll could still increase. In one video circulating online somewhat grainy and taken from a distance a column of trainees is briefly seen in marching formation before it is obliterated by a direct hit that comes out of nowhere. A number of trainees are thrown to the ground immediately – many of them presumably killed – while a handful of survivors attempt to flee. A second much more graphic clip has also emerged apparently taken in the moments following the strike. Screams of shock and prayers can be heard as someone looks over the grisly scene with body parts and puddles of blood scattered across the academy courtyard. Footage captured later on shows debris still littering the charred concrete. While it remains unclear who carried out the deadly bombing this weekend the UN’s envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame suggested on Monday it was “probably” forces supporting the rival legislature based in Tobruk led by military commander Khalifa Haftar. A spokesperson from Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) denied any involvement in the attack. Salame stopped short of assigning definitive blame however and spoke out against foreign interference in Libya. “Keep your hands out of Libya the country is suffering too much from foreign interference in different ways” Salame said. “There is enough weapons in Libya they don’t need extra weapons there are enough mercenaries in Libya so stop sending mercenaries as is the case right now with hundreds probably thousands coming into the country.” On Thursday the Turkish parliament approved the deployment of troops and weapons in Libya in order to prop up the GNA against the LNA. Haftar responded by declaring jihad and vowing to “confront and expel” any foreign forces in Libya. Though the GNA is the internationally recognized government Haftar’s forces control most of the country. They have made efforts to take Tripoli since April last year and announced a major push in early December.

202,The visa request was filed several weeks ago before the latest escalation and would give the top Iranian diplomat a stage to speak out following last Thursday’s drone strike assassination of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Qassem Soleimani along with senior Iraqi militia leaders. “They fear that someone comes to the US and reveals realities” Zarif said after being denied a visa. He vowed to communicate with the American people from Tehran noting that “the world is not limited to New York.” The US State Department has declined to comment on the Iranian diplomat’s visa troubles. The murder of Soleimani who played a key role in the fight against Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) terrorists in Syria and Iraq has drawn outrage across Iran and Iraq with Tehran vowing to avenge the assassination which it called “an act of international terrorism.” Washington meanwhile insists that Soleimani was the mastermind behind a spate of attacks on American personnel including at the US Embassy and says he was plotting new assaults. This wouldn’t be the first time Washington abused its status as the host of the UN headquarters refusing to issue visas for nearly a dozen members of the Russian delegation to a summit in New York last year.

203,The breathtaking visuals were created with help from SOFIA a high-powered airborne telescope fixed to a modified Boeing 747 which cast its infrared gaze 600 light years into the Milky Way. Combining SOFIA’s data with that of other telescopes produced a dazzling composite image of our galaxy’s center. “It’s incredible to see our galactic center in detail we’ve never seen before” said James Radomski a scientist working on the SOFIA project at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California. The Quintuplet Cluster where stars burn a million times brighter than Earth’s Sun also clearly emerged in the composite. The snapshot may help researchers understand what’s holding up the star-formation in the remote region. Though rich with gas dust and other space debris scientists have detected a puzzling lack of massive stars near the galactic center around 10 times fewer than expected. “Understanding how massive star birth happens at the center of our own galaxy gives us information that can help us learn about other more distant galaxies” said Matthew Hankins the principal investigator of the project and a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology. Scientists also have better insight into the supermassive blackhole smack in the center of the Milky Way thanks to the new image which provides a view of a mysterious 10-light-year-wide ring surrounding the gargantuan void which continues to baffle researchers. Collected in July 2019 the new SOFIA data was presented for the first time at an event in Hawaii earlier this week and has been submitted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal.

204,The bombers will be “available for operations against Iran if ordered” CNN’s Barbara Starr reported Monday citing an unnamed US official though the reporter noted the new deployment “does not signal that operations have been ordered.” The deployment also appears to have been corroborated by military aviation watchers who tracked at least two bombers as they departed from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The six bombers will follow nearly 4000 US troops deployed to the region since last week sent as hostilities with Iran reached new heights. Following a heated demonstration at the American Embassy in Baghdad which Washington portrayed as an “Iranian attack” the US launched a kill strike on the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force Qassem Soleimani as he arrived to Baghdad for a meeting also taking out several allied Iraqi militia leaders along with him. While the US maintains the general was involved in plots to attack American forces Tehran insists the assassination – of a top official on a diplomatic trip no less – was an act of “international terrorism” and has vowed to retaliate. Monday’s B-52 deployment is not the only one in recent months with four more of the long-range heavy bombers sent to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar last May also for the purpose of countering the so-called “Iranian threat.” Like this story?

206,Chinmayi Sripada became one of the leading figures in India’s #MeToo movement when she accused popular lyricist and novelist Vairamuthu of sexual assault (a claim that he rejects). She has one million followers on Twitter – and that’s where she sparked a heated debate over her recent post. “A woman’s character a Dalit’s merit and a Muslim’s patriotism are always questioned in this country” her message read. Though the words were not Sripada’s own – the quote had previously gone viral on social media – her followers were quick to react. Many users accused the singer of trying to over-simplify complicated issues. She was also accused of “fake feminism” and trying to connect “unrelated things” for attention. There are plenty of Indians who are “not even caste conscious” argued another Twitter user arguing that her post “conflates issues” and damages Sripada’s credibility. Tensions over religious issues are ongoing in India over Muslim protests – sometimes violent in nature – against a new citizenship law which they claim is discriminatory. New Delhi continues to stress that the legislation is not prejudiced against any group. Like this story?

209,"Iranian MPs adopted a bill on Tuesday calling “personnel of the Pentagon all affiliated companies institutions agents and commanders” members of a “terrorist entity”local media reported. The bill amends and expands previous legislation which gave a similar designation to US Central Command (CENTCOM). Initiated in April of last year it was a tit-for-tat response to Washington’s blacklisting of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The latest designation however comes as tensions between Washington and Tehran reach boiling point following the US’ assassination of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Friday. Tehran has vowed to avenge Soleimani’s death a promise that in turn led to US President Donald Trump threatening to strike 52 “very high level"" Iranian cultural and state targets should Iran hit any American interests. The Iranian government has reportedly been considering 13 “revenge scenarios” in retaliation for Soleimani’s killing. The semi-official Fars News Agency quoted Iranian Supreme National Security Council secretary Ali Shamkhani as saying that “even if there is consensus on the weakest scenario carrying it out can be a historic nightmare for the Americans.” Think your friends would be interested?

210,Some of Germany’s small contingent of troops in Iraq will be moved to neighboring Jordan and Kuwait the German government said on Tuesday. German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and Foreign Minister Heiko Maas wrote to lawmakers that the troops stationed in Baghdad and Taji would be “temporarily thinned out.”  Thirty out of an estimated 120 German soldiers are set to be redeployed. The German government says they could be moved back if their training mission resumes. The move comes a day after German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi about the issue. Merkel had stressed the importance of continued cooperation between Iraq and the EU in the fight against terrorism. Like this story?

211,While there have been other contenders discovered in the TRAPPIST-1 system and several potentially-habitable worlds identified by NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope the recently discovered exoplanet TOI 700 d was the first discovered by TESS with the help of NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope. TOI 700 is a small cool M class dwarf star roughly 100 light-years away in the constellation Dorado. It boasts 40 percent the mass and size of our sun with roughly half the Sun’s surface temperature.  Around the star TESS has observed at least three planets only one of which is in the so-called ‘Goldilocks Zone’ which might produce conditions for human habitation and for life most notably those that allow for liquid water on the surface.  Planet TOI 700 b is almost exactly Earth-sized probably rocky and completes an orbit every ten days while TOI 700 c is 2.6 times larger than Earth orbits every 16 days and is likely to be a gassy planet though both are too close to the sun to sustain life. TOI 700 d however is the outermost of the three and the only planet in the habitable zone of the system. It is 20 percent larger than the Earth has an orbit of 37 days and absorbs 86 percent of the energy that the Earth receives from the Sun.  NASA believes that the planets are all tidally locked which means they rotate once per orbit meaning one side of the surface is in constant sunlight. This would mean that if it has an atmosphere its cloud formations and wind patterns would be vastly different from those found here on Earth. “Additionally in 11 months of data we saw no flares from the star which improves the chances TOI 700 d is habitable and makes it easier to model its atmospheric and surface conditions” Emily Gilbert a graduate student at the University of Chicago.  Researchers at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland modelled 20 possible environments for TOI 700 d including one ocean-covered simulation with a CO2-rich atmosphere similar to what scientists believe Mars was like many years ago.  Another model led to a cloudless all-land version of modern Earth with winds flowing away from the night side of the planet all converging on a point directly facing the star.  Future missions will hopefully determine whether the planets have atmospheres or not and what their composition is.

212,The unit previously stationed in the southeastern region of North Gyeongsang Province was moved to a former military installation located behind the presidential office compound Yonhap news agency reported citing sources familiar with the matter. The redeployment was reportedly carried out earlier this month. It is also mentioned in the report that the unit is believed to be equipped with missiles capable of intercepting an aircraft or missiles at altitudes of around 20-40km (12.5-25 miles). The decision to relocate the system follows a series of warnings issued by Pyongyang including a threat alluding to the unveiling of a new strategic weapon “in the near future.” President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday that South Korea must strengthen its relationship with Pyongyang and has called for the resumption of dialogue between the two states. At the beginning of the year North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un announced that Pyongyang is dropping its earlier nuclear promises unless the US changed its policy. Previously North Korea had given Washington until the end of 2019 to rethink it’s hardline position which called for North Korea to drop its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

213,The court sentence for the 19-year-old was suspended for three years and she has been ordered to pay €148 in legal fees. The ruling closely watched by women’s rights groups brings good news for her family as it means that she can now return to the UK. She was given “a second chance” according to judge Michalis Papathanasiou who read out the verdict. He led a three-month trial in which the young woman was accused of public mischief after recanting her claim that she was raped by 12 Israeli holidaymakers last July. Her case resonated widely in the British press when it emerged she had allegedly been forced by Cypriot investigators to sign a retraction statement – something police have denied. London piled enormous pressure on Cypriot authorities with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab demanding that they “make it right” and not impose a heavy penalty on the woman. Like this story?

214,The Defence Food Research Laboratory produced a menu of about 30 dishes which range from moong dal halwa an Indian dessert made with split mung beans to idli a type of savoury rice cake along with a selection of vegetable rolls and egg rolls. While the dishes are all classified as Ready To Eat (RTE) the crew will enjoy the relative luxury of having a food heater on board so they can enjoy hot meals while taking in the views of planet Earth.  “Apart from the food we are also tasked with providing food-warmer technology stainless steel cutlery and a waste disposal pack” Defence Food Research Laboratory director Anil Semwal said.  Despite being impressed with the fare on offer many took the opportunity to joke about the absence of the traditional Muslim biryani dish from the menu. Some were even forward-thinking enough to suggest bringing a few spare Indian delicacies just in case the crew encounters extraterrestrials during their five to seven-day mission in low Earth orbit. India's three person mission to space Mission Gaganyaan is scheduled to lift off sometime in 2021. If successful India will become one of just four nations to launch a manned mission to space alongside Russia the US and China.  Last week ISRO chief K Sivan announced that the four candidates for the mission have been selected and will begin their training in Russia later this month. The manned mission will be preceded by two unmanned missions to orbit the first in December followed by a second in 2021. The ISRO previously stated it wants a female astronaut on the mission but the identities of the crew have yet to be revealed publicly.  The mission is estimated to cost roughly US$1.3 billion (10000 Crore) and has been set a launch target of no later than December 2021 by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

215,"Iranians poured into the streets of Soleimani’s hometown of Kerman on Tuesday to pay their final respects. Photographs of the funeral procession show throngs of mourners dressed in black. Some carried flags and portraits of the slain Quds Force leader as they slowly moved through the town. Local media estimated that several million people attended the funeral. However the huge turnout led to a stampede which killed over 50 people medics told ISNA news agency. Most of the victims were men of different ages they added. Previous reports said that at least 213 others were injured.  Graphic videos on social media purportedly show trampled bodies lying on the street. The crowds forced authorities to temporarily postpone Soleimani’s burial the semi-official ISNA reported. Shortly after 6pm local time ISNA reported again that Soleimani's body had been ""transferred to the martyrs section of Kerman cemetery"" and the burial ceremony begun. Soleimani was killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad last week prompting several days of mourning in Iran. A funeral ceremony in Tehran held on Monday reportedly drew more than a million people but no serious injuries or deaths were reported.

217,The study by United for All Ages a charity which focuses on bringing old and young people together says that UK citizens rarely interact with other generations outside of their own families. One of the charity’s directors Stephen Burke claimed bringing different generations together was one of “the biggest challenges for the new decade.” He added that “the last decade saw huge disconnection and division.” According to the report divisions have increased as a result of the housing market with the concentration of wealth now firmly in the hands of older people. They tend to live in towns and rural areas while the young are sucked in by city life. The authors of the report published on Tuesday are calling for care homes to become community hubs and for schools to stay open longer to provide community spaces for intergenerational activities. Other ideas put forward include creating an additional bank holiday as a “national day of unity” to bring people together and a new government department for connection that gives support to intergenerational projects.

218,Under the new rules announced Monday by Monika Bickert Facebook’s head of global policy management videos will be removed from Instagram and Facebook if they meet two criteria.  Videos will be automatically flagged by Facebook if they have “been edited or synthesised … in ways that aren’t apparent to an average person and would likely mislead someone into thinking that a subject of the video said words that they did not actually say” or if they are “the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning that merges replaces or superimposes content onto a video making it appear to be authentic.” If a video is deemed to be false or partly false Facebook will “significantly reduce” its distribution in users’ news feeds and reject it outright if it is posing as an ad.  The company is opting to leave such offending videos on the platform but marking them false to help prevent them spreading under false pretences on other social media platforms and elsewhere on the internet.  In a bid to cover all its bases Facebook said that even videos that do not meet these two criteria would still be eligible for “independent review” by the company's third-party fact-checkers which include 50 partners covering 40 languages. Facebook gave no immediate clear examples of what type of content would be in breach of such rules though it did state that the policy does not cover ‘shallow fakes’ or videos made using traditional video editing tools while claiming that parody and satire videos would be exempted.  “This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or video that has been edited solely to omit or change the order of words” Bickert stated. One example of the difference in content which contravenes the guidelines and that which does not would be videos shared last year of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slurring her speech. This footage would apparently not contravene Facebook's new ‘deepfake’ guidelines as it was merely slowed down and the audio pitch-shifted using traditional video editing techniques.  In 2018 Donald Trump shared a video of a Fox News segment which was edited in such a way as to make it appear as though Pelosi was fumbling her words. This would fall under “traditional video editing techniques” and would therefore be allowed on the platform. But another video that went viral online purported to show Pelosi slurring far more heavily and was often posted with titles insinuating that she was drunk. This type of video falls somewhere in the middle as it has been both slowed down and pitch-shifted though not necessarily by an AI or machine learning algorithm and would therefore likely be referred to the third party fact checkers for review. However the company added that if a politician posts something which breaches the deepfake guidelines they may still allow it to remain even if it was expressly intended to mislead if Facebook deems the public interest in seeing it outweighs the potential harm.

219,Elon Musk showcased his little-known dance talent as he rejoiced at the official launch of his company’s Model 3 electric cars in Shanghai right in front of the city mayor and top-tier officials. As some song was turned on the eccentric billionaire started to boogie away on the stage busting out somewhat awkward dance moves. He gave out high fives even throwing his jacket off as the beats got more energetic. No stranger to bizarre on-stage stunts Musk tweeted footage of his performance later on. The original soundtrack however was changed to a Chinese song which made the strange set-up a bit more melodic.   Unsurprisingly many of Musk’s followers rushed to respond with many joking about his moves. “Peak Dad dancing” one Twitter user wrote while another added: “Should’ve taken it all off.” Others checked his dance against the previous ones suggesting that his skills haven’t improved. There were also some who drew parallels with the already forgotten dance performed by Bill Gates at the launch of Windows 95 almost 25 years ago. All in all Musk’s performance stole the limelight from the actual event which spells delivery of the very first batch of middle-market made-in-China cars made at Tesla’s Shanghai megafactory worth around $2 billion. Construction works at the enormous facility started on the outskirts of Shanghai on January 7 last year and production of the Model 3 began in October. Like this story?

220,Forty-three percent of Americans said they approved of the US drone strike that killed the Iranian commander last week in Baghdad while 38% disapproved and 19% said they were unsure according to the results of a HuffPost/YouGov survey. The somewhat shaky support for the controversial strike appears at odds with Americans’ views on Trump’s broader strategy for dealing with Tehran. A mere 32% believe that the US president has a clear Iran policy while 47% said Washington’s approach toward the Islamic Republic lacks cohesion. And while almost half the country backs Soleimani’s assassination 60% of Americans conceded that they had never heard of the Quds Force commander before last week. An additional 14% said they weren’t sure if they had known about him before the strike. The survey was conducted between January 3 and January 5 among a sample size of 1000 US adults.

221,Governor Wanda Vazquez activated the National Guard and declared the emergency after the magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck off the Caribbean island’s southern coast at 4:24am local time near the city of Ponce. It struck at a depth of just 6km according to the USGS and was followed by several powerful aftershocks. El Nuevo Dia newspaper is reporting that a 73-year-old man died after a wall fell on him during one of the quakes. The US territory has been rocked by dozens of temblors in recent days including a 5.8 magnitude quake that damage toppled houses and sparked small landslides on Monday.   Authorities have activated security measures on the island and said all public sector offices except for emergency services would remain closed while emergency plans are implemented. The full impact of the tremors has yet to be revealed but several buildings in the town of Guanica have collapsed and there have been widespread power outages across the island. Footage on social media even shows power outages in Puerto Rico’s capital San Juan including at the country’s main airport which is over 100km from the epicenter of the quake. Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) Chief Executive Jose Ortiz said its Central Costa Sur power plant sustained damage during the quake and it is checking other substations on the island. The utility said on Twitter that it cut off power on safety grounds and hoped to reconnect supplies as soon as possible. Like this story?

222,With Brexit day (January 31) fast approaching what could be more fitting than the sound of Britain’s most iconic bell tower reverberating on the strike of 11 o’clock in celebration – or so the Tory Brexiteers were hoping. It appears the Conservative campaign – which had the support of former Brexit Secretary David Davis – to see this become a reality has been stopped in its tracks by House Speaker Lindsay Hoyle who has not selected their amendment for debate. The amendment to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) tabled on Tuesday requested that the famous bell be reattached at 11pm on Brexit day. The 315ft Grade I listed Elizabeth Tower along with the rest of Parliament’s estate is undergoing refurbishment work. While it’s a blow for Tory campaigners it ostensibly won’t put a stop to Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage’s celebration plans. The man widely regarded as the single-most influential figure in the campaign to see the UK leave the European Union claims he’s planning a £100000 bash of his own in Trafalgar Square complete with fireworks speakers and bands. British lawmakers embark on three days of debating the Brexit WAB after coming back from Christmas recess on Tuesday following PM Boris Johnson’s landslide victory in the 2019 snap general election. Johnson’s huge parliamentary majority means that his Brexit deal with Brussels is likely to easily get the approval of a majority of MPs. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

223,Putin arrived in Damascus on Tuesday in the first visit to the Syrian capital since the outbreak of the war in 2011. His motorcade drove to the Russian expeditionary force’s command center where he met with Syrian President Bashar Assad. The Russian president told his Syrian colleague during the meeting that “the signs of peaceful life are visible to the naked eye on the streets of Damascus” according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. He also pointed out that it can now safely be said that “great progress has been made on the road to restoring Syria’s statehood and territorial integrity.” The two leaders were briefed on the military situation in Syria including the northwestern province of Idlib occupied by militants linked to Al-Qaeda. Assad thanked Putin and Russia for their support in restoring peace in Syria. Russian troops have been assisting the Syrian army since September 2015 in battling various terrorist groups including Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS). On his previous visit to Syria in 2017 Putin had only visited the Russian expeditionary force at Khmeimim Airbase in the Latakia Province. His meeting with Assad comes amid renewed tensions between the US and Iran – another ally of Damascus – over the US assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad last week. After the military briefing the Russian leader walked through Damascus and visited two major shrines of Muslims and Christians underlining their peaceful coexistence. At the famous Umayyad Mosque Putin presented the local community with a gift of a rare 17th-century copy of the Koran.  Visiting the Holy Virgin Mary Orthodox church the oldest Christian shrine in Syria Putin met with Antiochian Patriarch John X. As a Christmas gift he presented the patriarch with an icon of the Mother of God painted in Russia.  “Were it not for the Russian military aid terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi or some other militant chief would have stood in the place of this temple today” Peskov relayed the patriarch’s words to reporters.  Following his visit to Damascus Putin departed for Turkey where he is scheduled to attend the opening ceremonies of the ‘Turk Stream’ gas pipeline with his Turkish colleague Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He is also scheduled to discuss with Erdogan the security situation in both Syria and Libya where Turkey has just sent troops. Think your friends would be interested?

224,Newly published research has revealed that on 25 April 2019 two neutron stars around 520 million light-years away merged into a new object named GW190425 not exactly catchy. This event marks just the second such collision astronomers have seen; the first was detected back in August 2017 and called GW170817. Again astrophysicists and astronomers aren’t famed for their ability at coming up with catchy names. What has scientists really excited about this recent discovery is that it may soon shed light on a “previously undetected type of astrophysical system.” The difference between these two truly massive moments in scientific history is that during the more recent collision between the two stars of GW190425 there was no light detected.  This is likely because it happened so far away and one of the only instruments we have to detect such events was offline when it happened. However as always science finds a way and researchers were able to analyze the data and make some conclusions and some inferences determining that one of the neutron stars in the binary was 1.4 times the mass of the Sun and the other was around 2 times the mass of the Sun. “We were very surprised by the total mass of this ancient neutron star binary system which is about 3.4 times the mass of our Sun as it far exceeds the mass of known neutron star binaries in our own galaxy” said theoretical physicist Susan Scott of the Australian National University. This may mean that the previous binary system discovered (GW170817) formed differently than those found in the Milky Way which may also suggest that similar neutron binaries may not be detectable using current telescopic surveys of the sky. The collision may also provide new insights into the so-called “mass gap” which sits between neutron stars and black holes both of which are the ultra dense remains of dead stars. We’ve never observed a black hole smaller than five stellar masses and we’ve also never seen a neutron star larger than 2.5 stellar masses.  Continued study of both the epic objects and the as yet unknown bodies they produced could answer some of the most perplexing questions about this “mass gap.” Think your friends would be interested?

225,The British Academy of Film and Television Arts unveiled its 2020 nominations on Tuesday creating a storm of controversy in the process. All of the 18 stars tipped for best actor actress supporting actor and supporting actress are caucasian. Two actresses Margot Robbie and Scarlett Johansson were nominated twice.  Film fans took to Twitter to vent. “Things need to change” screenwriter Sarah Dollard wrote. “Membership demographics voting procedure the levelling of the playing field re screenings &amp; screeners. This can’t happen again.” Tuesday’s controversy is not the first time a hashtag campaign has been deployed to complain about the supposed lack of diversity in the entertainment industry. The 2015 2016 and 2017 BAFTAs were also panned for excluding minority actors and actresses. Across the Atlantic the #OscarsSoWhite campaign kicked off in 2016 too with even President Barack Obama weighing in asking Hollywood if people of all races were “getting a fair shot.” As for whether the movies themselves were any good that much was lost in the discussion. Commenters on Twitter insisted that actors Lupita Nyong’o Jennifer Lopez Awkwafina and Cynthia Erivo put in performances worthy of an award. Some cynical commenters disagreed however and argued“if you ain’t good enough you don’t deserve a nomination.” BAFTA’s awards director Emma Baehr addressed the controversy on Tuesday telling the Hollywood Reporter that her organization would be happy to nominate non-white actors and actresses if enough films featuring them were submitted for review. “We’d have liked to have seen more diversity in the nominations it does continue to be an industry-wide issue” she said. “I think more films need to be made and entered giving people a chance to see them.

227,Ocasio-Cortez (AOC for short) stepped a little too far outside the mainstream when she clicked ‘like’ on a tweet by journalist Rania Khalek about US fears of Iranian retaliation over the killing of General Qassem Soleimani. An army of blue-checks and their enforcers quickly encircled her to point out the error of her ways gloating when she finally knuckled under and apologized. AOC was one of the few Democratic politicians credibly horrified by President Donald Trump’s unprovoked attack and to her credit she immediately took to Twitter to denounce it calling out an “act of war against Iran” that “risks the lives of millions of innocent people.” Khalek’s tweet was largely in the same vein making the point that “this assassination did the opposite of making Americans safer and our leaders know it.” But it wasn’t the content of the tweet that infuriated these social media hall monitors who have been gently prodding AOC toward an anodyne centrism since she arrived in Washington; it was the account doing the tweeting. Khalek is an outspoken opponent of US foreign policy particularly the draconian sanctions and endless regime-change wars that have all but destroyed large swathes of the Middle East over the past two decades. She has made a lot of enemies in standing up for the US’s bogeymen and they came out in force to concern-troll AOC. “I’m a big fan but did you know you’ve committed a thoughtcrime?” seemed to be the general message.  Some like ‘professional troll’ Maryam Nayeb Yazdi who has made no secret of her loathing for Iran’s current government deleted their tweets after AOC was badgered into un-liking Khalek’s message and - supposedly - apologizing via Direct Message for her ‘crime’.    But merely apologizing and unliking the tweet wasn’t enough for some - one regime change fan actually called for a memo to be circulated in Congress to warn “progressive members” about Khalek and fellow anti-war journalists Max Blumenthal and Ben Norton. Clearly a preemptive strike against wrongthink was needed.  It’s hardly the first time AOC has made a bold statement and then ran in the other direction - she was shamed away from speaking out against the Israeli occupation of Palestine before she was even officially elected to Congress and more recently she was the subject of a Twitter pile-on when she attempted to speak up for UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Nor is it the first time a ’progressive’ US politician has had their knuckles rapped for veering too far outside the accepted mainstream. Even Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard one of the loudest voices in Washington speaking out against the US’s regime change wars has been forced to adopt the establishment line about Syrian President Bashar Assad with whom she met in 2017 in the service of finding a peaceful solution to the decade-long war the US has waged in his country. Following an avalanche of media criticism that is still ongoing nearly three years later Gabbard has called Assad an evil dictator. Unfortunately there are no progressive role models in Congress for AOC (or Gabbard for that matter) to look up to as an example of how to stick to one’s principles and stand against war. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders while a steadfast supporter of the rights of the working class has largely toed the line on foreign policy throughout his career lining up with the rest of Congress to demand Assad Venezuela's Maduro - or whoever the bogeyman of the moment is - must go. Even the standard-bearers of the rabidly anti-Trump Democratic Party limited their criticism of the Soleimani strike to the president’s failure to gain approval from Congress first. AOC may have to choose between being on the right side of history and being embraced by her party - and its Twitter enforcers.

228,The move was made public in a letter to the families of Canadian soldiers in and near Iraq posted to Twitter on Tuesday. Canada has about 500 troops in Iraq out of 800 in total in the region and it's not clear how many are leaving or for how long. The decision to temporarily relocate was made in conjunction with NATO and other Canadian allies Vance continued adding that Canada has “temporarily paused” its military activities falling under Operation IMPACT and NATO Mission Iraq. The Iraqi parliament passed a resolution earlier this week urging an end to the presence of foreign troops after a US airstrike killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad Airport. While US President Donald Trump has threatened Iraq with massive sanctions if it forces the US to withdraw without paying for an expensive airbase the Americans built a letter published Monday appeared to show the US planning to withdraw from the country. The Pentagon has fervently denied this is the case. Germany announced on Tuesday that it will move some of its troops stationed in Iraq to Jordan and Kuwait. Like this story?

229,Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi acknowledged receiving a letter from the US military containing an outline for the withdrawal of American troops from his country. However the Iraqi leader said that the English and Arabic versions of the letter were not identical and that he has requested clarification Reuters reported on Tuesday. One day earlier a copy of a letter announcing the US withdrawal was circulated online and confirmed as genuine by a US Army press spokesman. However the Pentagon did not immediately confirm its authenticity and Defense Secretary Mark Esper later stated that that the letter was a “poorly worded” draft copy leaked by mistake. Esper added that “there’s been no decision to leave Iraq. Period.” The letter emerged after the Iraqi parliament voted on Sunday to expel all foreign troops from the country following the US assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad International Airport on Friday and several clashes between American forces and Iranian-backed militia groups in the weeks beforehand. The parliament resolution is non-binding and US President Donald Trump responded by threatening sanctions on Iraq and refusing to leave until the Iraqis “pay us back” for an airbase that he said cost billions of dollars to build. The assassination of Soleimani drove already simmering US-Iran tensions to boiling point. Tehran has vowed to avenge its fallen general while Trump has threatened to launch military strikes on 52 Iranian state and cultural sites should American interests be harmed. As Soleimani’s body was buried in Iran on Tuesday the semi-state Fars news agency reported that the Iranian government is considering 13 “revenge scenarios” in retaliation for the killing.

230,"Soleimani commander of the Iranian military’s Quds Force was assassinated in a drone strike in Baghdad Iraq on Friday. Before the strike President Donald Trump implicated Iran in a fatal rocket attack on an American base in Iraq in December and in the storming of the American embassy in Baghdad by protesters last week. Afterwards he said that Soleimani was killed to prevent “imminent and sinister” attacks against American officials and troops in the Middle East. With Washington and Tehran throwing escalatory threats at each other following the strike Pompeo spoke to reporters on Tuesday. Asked for evidence of the threat posed by Soleimani the US secretary of state provided little in the way of information. Instead he claimed that America’s intelligence agencies gave Trump “multiple pieces of information” proving Soleimani’s nefarious intentions but declined to say what this information detailed.  Citing Soleimani’s activities in Iraq and Syria but neglecting to mention that the Quds Force commander was instrumental in the defeat of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) in these countries Pompeo again gave no specific evidence of any planned attacks. Instead he pointed to the rocket attack on an American base and to the embassy riots as proof of his future plans. “If you’re looking for imminence you needn’t look no further than the days that lead up to the strike” he told reporters. “It was the right decision. We got it right.” Few observers were left satisfied. “He has absolutely nothing” one commenter wrote on Twitter. “These men want to lie us into war again.” At a Pentagon press conference later on Tuesday Defense Secretary Mark Esper reiterated the administration's claim of imminent attacks stating that Soleimani was planning on hitting US targets within ""days for sure."" Esper also quashed rumors that the US is preparing to leave Iraq even after the Iraqi parliament voted to expel foreign troops. Esper said that the vote was non-binding and argued that ordinary Iraqis want American troops to stay in the country. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi claimed on Sunday that Soleimani was in Iraq to discuss a possible peace agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia. When asked about this on Tuesday Pompeo laughed and delivered a sarcastic response. “Anybody here believe that?” he asked. “Is there any history that would indicate that it is remotely possible that this kind gentleman this diplomat of great order Qassem Soleimani had traveled to Baghdad for the idea of conducting a peace mission? We know that wasn’t true.” The assassination of Soleimani triggered the sharpest escalation of tensions between Iran and the US since the Trump administration withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA or Iran nuclear deal) in 2018 and launched a “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions and isolation on the Islamic Republic. In recent days Trump has threatened to target 52 “high level” Iranian cultural and state sites while Iran has declared the US military a “terrorist entity” and reportedly considered 13 “revenge scenarios” in retaliation for Soleimani’s killing. No officials on either side have as of yet explicitly called for open war. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

231,With the UK still reeling from more than three years of debates about Brexit even simple packaging can set off hair triggers with some fearing any expression of national pride. In this feverish environment a picture of a Co-Op ice cube bag emblazoned with a British flag and the words “made with British water” has sparked a meltdown on Twitter. “What is British water exactly? Does it fall on the left live in a thatched cottage and think itself superior to other races of H2O?” one exasperated commenter asked. “Water flows here there and everywhere. Water like fish knows no borders. The Co-op has been and should be better than this. Stop it” another added. “What next? British air?” came another wry response. The supermarket sought to explain the situation by outlining that its labelling policy dictates that it provides the country of origin of the main ingredients in any product even ice cubes. “Sorry if our ice cubes have caused a bit of chill on Twitter” a spokesperson for the brand said. “But our labelling policy means that we always aim to provide the country origin of the main ingredients in any product and that includes the water in our ice cubes.

232,The deputy commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was among the Iranian and Iraqi officials killed in a US operation in Baghdad on Friday. And PMF which unites some 40 militias and has around 150000 members promised that they won’t let American “criminals” get away with murder. “All retaliation options are on the table… no red lines shall hinder our revenge” Jawad Al Telbawi a commander of one of the factions within the group told the Independent. “We shall convulse the ground underneath the American army’s feet in Iraq. Theseare not slogans rather truths in which we believe.” The threat was directed at “fool and a blackmailer” Trump his administration and the US military stationed in Iraq but Telbawi also had plenty to say to ordinary Americans. He called upon US citizens to “pressure” the Trump administration to pull out American troops from the Iraqi territory “before we send your soldiers back in coffins.” Anti-American sentiment was already strong in Iraq as local protesters tried storming the US embassy in Baghdad before the New Year. But it skyrocketed after the US strike against Soleimani which Washington carried out without even notifying the Iraqi authorities. In the wake of the attack the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution calling for the removal of US and other foreign troops from the country.  On Monday Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi spoke with US ambassador to Baghdad Matthew Tueller about “the importance of mutual cooperation on implementing the withdrawal of foreign troops” and preventing “the descent into open war.” But both the US president and the secretary of defense said they are not ready to leave yet insisting Iraqis want them to stay.

234,“It’s something ultimately that I want to see we can’t be there forever” Trump said Tuesday asked if he would pull out troops from Iraq. “Eventually we want to be able to let Iraq run its own affairs… but this isn’t the right point” he quickly added. The president’s words echoed the rhetoric coming from the Pentagon where Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters earlier in the day that there were no plans to pull out of Iraq regardless of the unsigned draft letter sent to the government in Baghdad on Monday suggesting otherwise. Trump did contradict Esper’s stated justification for staying in Iraq – the need to maintain a presence against the resurgence of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists – by saying that the US “got rid of the Caliphate a hundred percent of the Caliphate is gone.” He seemed convinced however that a majority of Iraqis want the US troops to stay saying that there was “tremendous support” from the people who do not wish to see Iran take over. “Iraqi people understand we’re there to help them stand up their sovereignty” chimed in Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who was at the Oval Office with Trump and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Both Pompeo and Esper have been working that talking point tirelessly for the past two days with the Pentagon chief telling reporters that Sunday’s resolution adopted by the Iraqi parliament that asked the US to leave was not the work of just some Shia lawmakers while Sunni and Kurdish MPs boycotted the vote.  The resolution followed last week’s US drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani outside Baghdad international airport. On Tuesday Trump once again called Soleimani a “monster” and a dangerous terrorist argued that the assassination saved lives of both Americans and Iraqis and noted that Soleimani had been “traveling with the head of Hezbollah” – possibly conflating the Lebanese-based militia with one of the factions of Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). PMF deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was killed in the same strike that targeted Soleimani. His death angered many Iraqis and PMF even threatened to send US troops back in coffins if they do not leave the country. Think your friends would be interested?

235,Putin’s plane touched down in Syria on Tuesday to everyone’s surprise as the president was last spotted in St. Petersburg the evening before attending the Orthodox Christmas Eve service. His unannounced trip included not only talks about fighting terrorism with Syrian President Bashar Assad but also visits to the city’s historic religious sites. After the talks Putin and Assad took a walk through the center of Damascus stopping at the Umayyad Mosque also known as the Great Mosque. One of the largest and oldest mosques in the world hosts the head of John the Baptist who is also venerated in Islam as Prophet Yahya. The relic was shown to the Russian leader who responded in the manner of a good guest presenting the mosque with a 17th-century copy of the Koran. The two leaders then headed to the oldest Orthodox church in Syria the Mariamite Cathedral built during the second century. It’s the seat of John X the Patriarch of Antioch and All the East who greeted the high-ranked guests. The Patriarch thanked Putin for sending the Russian military to assist Syria in the fight against terrorists. Without this help the church could’ve now been the headquarters of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi or some militant warlord he said. John X also described Syria as a tolerant place “where different religions – both Christians and Muslims – coexist peacefully and enjoy the same rights.” The Russian president had a gift for him as well an icon of the Virgin Mary painted in Russia. After a brief but busy stay in Damascus Putin flew to neighboring Turkey where he is scheduled to hold security and trade talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and attend the ceremonial opening of the ‘Turk Stream’ gas pipeline.

236,Paltrow’s medical faddism “does real harm” by contributing to the “erosion of critical thinking” University of Alberta researcher Tim Caulfield tweeted on Monday after Netflix posted a teaser for the premiere of “The Goop Lab” later this month setting off a firestorm of panic among a certain stripe of science enthusiast. The idea of an entire show devoted to whatever bizarre health practices the actress can dredge up from obscurity - the teaser mentioned psychic readings exorcisms and “cold therapy” - has triggered calls for its cancellation from skeptics who fear an outbreak of 'monkey see monkey do' among its audience. Caulfield wrote a whole article last month eviscerating the celebrity “wellness” industry insisting that while it might seem like a relatively harmless form of profiteering it actually gives cover to scientifically-unproven health practices. Non-pharmaceutical procedures like cryotherapy gluten-free dieting and IV vitamin therapy - to say nothing of the jade egg that made Goop a household name - would be utterly obscure if not for their celebrity boosters he argued accusing celebrities of contributing to a “culture of untruth” and confusing people about what a “healthy lifestyle” entails.But pharmaceutical companies - FDA-approved drugs being the preferred route to health for many critics of Paltrow and other celebrity wellness gurus - spend over $6.4 billion advertising their products to customers every year. Some of these ads use celebrities - who can forget then-presidential candidate Bob Dole’s star turn in that Viagra ad or Olympic athlete Bruce (now Caitlin) Jenner’s fulsome praise of painkiller Vioxx on the Larry King show?  Vioxx may have gone on to kill tens of thousands of people but at least they weren’t taken in by some snake-oil seller like Goop. Surely Americans should have the right to choose whether they’d prefer to pop pills juice or shove a jade egg where the sun doesn’t shine? Not to Caulfield and the others who joined him in speaking out against The Goop Lab. An absence of critical thinking and a favorable feeling for celebrity anecdotes have combined to short-circuit our natural skepticism he insists going so far as to link the Goop craze with the “fake news” epidemic. Indeed he’s written an entire book slamming Paltrow and Goop - apparently hoping readers will stop uncritically listening to and funneling money to celebrity wellness gurus and start uncritically listening to and funneling money to him instead. It’s a microcosm of the “fake news” epidemic in general which exists largely in the minds of establishment journalists angry when their audiences prefer competing narratives. A change.org petition apparently launched last year when the show was first proposed warns that Goop is scaring people away from vaccinating their children and warns that a measles “epidemic” underway in Washington at the time would worsen if people take the celebrity’s advice. Ironically the petition features an image of a baby suffering a rash in reaction to receiving the smallpox vaccine - though it had been erroneously passed off as a child with measles by CNN. Paltrow is routinely excoriated for introducing the world to “holistic health psychiatrist” Kelly Brogan who espouses a link between vaccines and autism in 2018 even though the Goop website dismisses the vaccine-autism link as a “conspiracy theory” in the only vaccine-related article it has published. The petition author isn’t the only one to draw a direct causal line between Paltrow’s show and declining enthusiasm for vaccines - some went even further and suggested children would die of vaccine-preventable diseases if The Goop Lab was allowed to air. Others (accidentally) admitted that real scientists already have health shows and that those are carried by Netflix already. While the common line seemed to be that the bizarre treatments publicized by Goop were “harmful” even predatory… …some pointed out that not all “medical” treatments were particularly scientific or healthy either. Paltrow’s show may give a voice to the most ridiculous pseudoscience but censoring it “because harm” is a step down a slippery slope that ends in barring coverage of all treatments that fall outside the scope of orthodox medicine from the airwaves. Every medical innovation has faced doubt before becoming widely accepted - better to beef up one’s own critical thinking abilities than impose censorship in service to the lowest common denominator.

237,“Multiple sites” have come under attack by Iranian ballistic and cruise missiles Fox News reported citing anonymous Pentagon officials. There has been no official confirmation from the US Department of Defense. Iranian news agency FARS reported the launch of multiple missiles in “revenge” for last week’s drone strike that assassinated IRGC Quds Force head General Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad international airport along with several leaders of the Iraqi Shia militia. Anonymous Pentagon officials claim the missiles came from Iranian soil which would be a first since the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988. The attacks come after US President Donald Trump ruled out any US withdrawal from Iraq contrary to a letter that was sent to the government in Baghdad on Monday by a regional US commander.  Pulling out would turn the country over to Iran Trump said. He also threatened Iran with “tremendous” strikes if it dared attack US forces. Al-Asad is located in Western Iraq’s Anbar province and was targeted by a rocket attack in early December just a week after the Thanksgiving holiday visit by US Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen. There were no casualties and the rockets’ origin was never identified. Like this story? Share it with a friend! , https://www.rt.com/news/477674-alasad-airbase-rockets-iraq/,None

240,“The brave soldiers of IRGC's aerospace unit have launched a successful attack with tens of ballistic missiles” on the Al-Asad base in the name of General Soleimani the IRGC said in a statement early on Wednesday morning adding: The IRGC also warned all US allies in the region that they will be targeted if any aggressive action is undertaken from their territory putting Kuwait Bahrain Saudi Arabia Jordan and Israel on notice. Saeed Jalili an adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took to Twitter soon after the strikes to taunt US President Donald Trump posting a lone image of an Iranian flag just as Trump did with an American flag the night Soleimani was killed.  Iran's telecommunications minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi also weighed in with a tweet insisting that Washington “Get the hell out of our region!” Iran threatened “hard revenge” against the US for Soleimani’s death. The leader of IRGC’s Quds Force was assassinated in a drone strike last Thursday outside Baghdad international airport in Iraq. The strike on Al-Asad and several other US bases in Iraq took place at 01:20 local time the exact time Soleimani’s convoy was struck. President Trump called Soleimani a “monster” and a terrorist whose death saved lives and threatened Iran with “disproportionate” US strikes if it endangered any Americans anywhere.  Trump also ruled out US withdrawal from Iraq contrary to a letter that was sent to the government in Baghdad on Monday by a regional US commander saying that doing so would practically hand the country over to Tehran.

244,The IRGC issued a statement in the early hours of Wednesday local time after launching a volley of missiles against two bases used by US forces inside Iraq in retaliation for last week’s drone assassination of IRGC Quds Force leader Qassem Soleimani outside Baghdad. The statement according to Tasnim news agency also said that Tehran sees no difference between the “Zionist regime” – meaning Israel – and the US when it comes to the “crime” of assassinating Soleimani. This was presumably in reaction to reports that Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu was trying to disassociate from the strike calling it a purely American affair. The IRGC also put any regional US allies – such as Kuwait Jordan Saudi Arabia or Bahrain – on notice that their territory will be targeted if US bases on their soil are used to carry out strikes against Iran.

Iran threatened “hard revenge” against the US for Soleimani’s death. The strike on Al-Asad reportedly took place at 01:20 local time on Wednesday the exact time Soleimani’s convoy had been struck.

251,Putin’s visit was scheduled in advance and involved the ceremonial opening of ‘Turk Stream’ a natural gas pipeline running under the Black Sea from Russia to Turkey. He was also scheduled to meet with Erdogan in Istanbul and discuss the security situation in the region. However Iraq suddenly shot to the top of the agenda overnight as Iran fired off two volleys of missiles at US bases in retaliation for the US drone strike that killed Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps General Qassem Soleimani at a Baghdad airport last week.  As night fell in Washington it looked like neither the US nor Iran wanted to escalate things beyond that but a possible hot war between the two is certainly a cause for concern to both Moscow and Ankara. “Our region is tired of constant clashes from the intervention of external forces” Erdogan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told reporters earlier in the week adding that Turkey urged both Iran and the US to “reduce tensions.” Another hot topic is Erdogan’s decision to intervene in Libya. Turkey is seeking to prop up the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli the internationally recognized regime that has been reduced to control over the capital while the Libyan National Army (LNA) of General Khalifa Haftar holds most of the rest of the country. Haftar has declared jihad in response and vowed to drive out all foreign “invaders.” Erdogan and Putin also don’t see entirely eye to eye on Syria. The Turkish leader has been unhappy about the Syrian Army’s drive into Idlib the last remaining stronghold of the Turkish-backed “moderate rebels” that include Al-Qaeda affiliates. Kalin said that Turkey does not see President Bashar Assad as “the leader capable of taking the country into the future.” Russia on the other hand backs the government in Damascus where Putin stopped for a brief surprise visit on Tuesday. After a special military briefing Putin and Assad took a walk visiting a historic mosque and an Orthodox cathedral. Think your friends would be interested?

In a separate statement President Hassan Rouhani said that the US may have “cut off the arm” of assassinated Quds Force commander General Qassem Soleimani but Iran would respond by severing America's ""leg"" in the region.

255,"On Wednesday the Boeing 737-800 bound for Ukraine’s capital Kiev crashed after departing from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport. The plane was reportedly carrying 167 passengers from Canada Iran Sweden Afghanistan Germany and the UK as well as 11 Ukrainian citizens as well as nine crew members the country's national security council confirmed. Shortly after the crash Ukraine International Airlines announced it is suspending all flights to Tehran. In its statement the company said that the plane underwent its last scheduled maintenance on Monday. An investigation is already underway to determine the cause of the crash and representatives from UIA are in direct contact with the families of those affected. The airline also declined to comment on rumors that the plane was shot down. Ukrainian authorities later announced that Kiev is banning flights over Iran from January 9 until the causes of the tragedy are clarified. “As soon as the causes are clarified the decision will certainly be reconsidered” Ukrainian Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk said. European carriers started rerouting flights crossing the Middle East amid escalating tensions between the US and Iran. Air France said on Wednesday it is suspending all flights over Iran and Iraq the company told Sputnik. Meanwhile German’s Lufthansa said it had canceled its flight from Frankfurt to Tehran on Wednesday over situation in the region. The company later changed its mind and decided to resume flights to the Iranian capital starting Thursday but added that its group airlines would continue to fly around Iranian and Iraqi airspace. The Russian aviation agency Rosaviatsia sent an official recommendation to all domestic airlines to avoid flying over Iran Iraq the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The agency explained the move citing “existing risks for the safety of international civil flights.” Some companies have already done so; Ural Airlines rerouted flights crossing Iran on Wednesday according to TASS. Russia’s S7 carrier said it is looking into changing the route of its flight from Russia's Novosibirsk to Dubai to abide by the recommendation. Russian major air carrier Aeroflot as well its subsidiaries Pobeda and Rossiya Airlines has already developed some alternative routes. Another company Utair rerouted some of its flights to fly over Egypt and Cyprus instead.  One of the major Kazakh airlines Air Astana as well as a smallerSCAT Airlines are also avoiding Iranian and Iraqi airspace. Kazakh airlines altered the route of its Dubai-bound flights from the nation's capital of Nur-Sultan and the city of Astana. Earlier in the day the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would ban US carriers from operating over Iraq Iran and some Persian Gulf airspace after Iran attacked US facilities in Iraq. The agency said the restrictions were issued “due to heightened military activities and increased political tensions in the Middle East which present an inadvertent risk to US civil aviation operations."" Shortly after the US's non-binding warning Australian carrier Qantas decided to divert some flights to Europe until further notice. Qantas’ non-stop flights between Perth to London frequently fly over Iran and Iraq and they were redirected to go over Afghanistan instead. At the same time Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines said that their aircraft would avoid Iranian airspace.  Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

256,Delivered to UIA in 2016 the Boeing 737-800 was “in excellent condition” before its last flight from Tehran to Kiev Evgeny Dykhne the company’s president told reporters in Kiev also describing the aircraft as “one of the best.” UIA flight director Ihor Sosnovsky ruled out a pilot error saying the ill-fated flight was manned by a reinforced crew comprising Captain Volodymyr Yaponenko Pilot Instructor Oleksiy Naumkin and First Officer Serhiy Khomenko. “Given their experience it is very hard to say that something was wrong with them” he insisted. There were six flight attendants on the plane and the entire crew had had enough rest before departing from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini airport Sosnovsky added. The airline had also undergone scheduled maintenance just two days before the crash on Wednesday which killed 167 passengers and nine crew. Most of the passengers were making connecting flights via Kiev’s Boryspil airport the main hub of UIA. There were citizens of Iran Canada Germany the UK Sweden and Afghanistan among the victims.  UIA’s 737-800 which belongs to the troubled family of Boeing’s single-aisle medium-haul jets was less than four years old according to Flightradar. Nevertheless it was extensively used by the airline completing up to four flights a day. Founded in 1992 as the country’s flag carrier UIA connects Ukraine with 38 countries in Europe Asia Africa and the Americas. Although the airline describes itself as a “low-fare network carrier” it hadn’t lost single plane in accidents or incidents in recent decades. Today’s tragedy in Iran which left 176 people dead was UIA’s first crash breaking its relatively good safety record. It also represented more bad news for Boeing which is struggling to repair its reputation after its newest 737 MAX plane killed 346 people in two separate crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia last year. The manufacturer has been accused of failing to inform pilots and industry stakeholders about a new potentially dangerous flight control feature on the MAX planes. In the wake of the tragedy the airline suspended all flights to and from Imam Khomeini. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky directed the government to launch an inquiry and to “consider all possible versions [of the crash].” Think your friends would be interested?

258,In 1879 astronomer Benjamin Gould discovered a long cloud of dust and gas the remnants of interconnected stellar nurseries stretching 3000 light years across which later became known as Gould’s Belt. After recent readings were taken by the Gaia mapping survey however it turns out Gould’s Belt is part of an even larger structure the largest of its kind ever discovered in our Milky Way galaxy.  According to scientific models the new structure is a wave of gas and dust that measures 9000 light-years long 400 light-years wide and extends 500 light-years above and below the galactic plane.  It has been dubbed the Radcliffe Wave after Harvard University’s Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study which analyzed the data from the mapping survey. “No astronomer expected that we live next to a giant wave-like collection of gas or that it forms the local arm of the Milky Way” said astronomer Alyssa Goodman of the Smithsonian Institution. Goodman said that both she and her team were “completely shocked when we first realised how long and straight the Radcliffe Wave is” when viewed from above.  “The Wave’s very existence is forcing us to rethink our understanding of the Milky Way’s 3D structure.” While it is the largest gaseous structure identified in the Milky Way it is far from the largest object we have observed. Fermi gamma-ray bubbles for example stretch some 50000 light-years.  The Gaia satellite was launched in 2013 tasked with producing the most accurate 3D map yet of our home galaxy so if any of our endeavors into space were going to come across the Radcliffe Wave this was it.  “The Sun lies only 500 light-years from the Wave at its closest point. It’s been right in front of our eyes all the time but we couldn’t see it until now” explained physicist and astronomer João Alves of the University of Vienna in Austria who postulates that the shape may be the result of some massive object interacting with our galaxy creating a ripple in our cosmic pond.

Cabinet Office Minister Oliver Dowden has now revised that version of events and said that while the link to the data was taken down after 40 minutes any individuals that had a direct web link had access to the sensitive information for a further 150 minutes.

He argued that US President Donald Trump should be applauded for ordering a drone strike that killed the Quds Force commander accusing the slain ""terrorist-in-chief"" of plotting to carry out acts of terror around the world. The Israeli prime minister stressed that his country ""stands completely beside"" the United States in its confrontation with Tehran.Until now Netanyahu had remained tight-lipped about Soleimani's killing describing the incident as a purely American affair that Israel had no part in.

Johnson failed to answer the question. The Labour leader hit out at the US' actions claiming they had escalated the risk of a dangerous conflict in an already destabilized region. Corbyn told British lawmakers that the US intervention had put “civilians UK troops and nationals at risk leaving the Iran nuclear deal in danger of being dead in the water.” Iran carried out ‘revenge’ missile attacks on two military bases home to US and coalition forces in Iraq on Tuesday after Soleimani was killed in drone strike authorized by President Donald Trump in the early hours of January 3.

267,“We live in a difficult world and unfortunately in the region we’re in now there are tendencies for the worsening of the situation” Putin said at the pipeline’s inauguration ceremony in Istanbul on Wednesday referring to ongoing tensions in Iran Iraq and Syria. He added that the ambitious project was “for the good of both our nations and our neighbors.” “Turkey does not want any global disagreement or escalation of tensions” Erdogan declared taking the stage next before asking his country’s Mediterranean neighbors to make the region a “center of cooperation.” However Turkey’s eastern neighbors are currently in turmoil. A series of tit-for-tat strikes in Iraq have pushed the United States and Iran to the brink of war. Erdogan disagrees with Moscow’s support for the Syrian government of Bashar Assad and Ankara is also seeking to wade into Libya’s civil war to prop up the government in Tripoli. “The region has been bleeding for a long time and unfortunately from Iraq to Syria millions of our innocent brothers have paid with their lives” Erdogan said. “The center of the Islamic civilization is basically destroyed brother turns on brother. Other countries from outside have tried to make use of it to interfere starting from Iraq.” Buried under the Black Sea the TurkStream pipeline has a capacity of 31.5 billion cubic meters and its two lines supply Turkey as well as southern and southeastern Europe. The pipeline was completed in the face of the United States threatening sanctions and reduces Europe’s reliance on gas transited through Ukraine.  With Russian gas flowing to Turkish shores and onward to Bulgaria Serbia and Hungary will also receive gas once new pipelines are constructed.

270,A Paris court decided on Wednesday that the former leader will stand trial from October 5 to 22 according to AFP. It will be the first trial in several graft cases against the 64-year-old who will be the first ex-president of France to stand trial on corruption charges. Sarkozy is suspected of attempting to obtain secret information from ex-high magistrate Gilbert Azibert in early 2014 through his lawyer Thierry Herzog. Herzog and Azibert will also stand trial. The case focuses on conversations between Herzog and Azibert that were tapped by investigators probing claims that Sarkozy had accepted illicit payments from the L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt for his 2007 presidential campaign. Sarkozy who was president from 2007 to 2012 fought to prevent the case from going to trial but his final bid failed last June. Since losing the presidency Sarkozy has faced a slew of corruption and campaign financing allegations. In October 2019 a court ruled he must stand trial for illicit campaign financing. If found guilty he could face a one-year jail term and a fine. Prosecutors in that case say the ex-president used fake invoices to spend nearly €43 million euros ($40 million) on his failed 2012 re-election bid - almost twice the legal limit. Sarkozy has also been charged over accusations he accepted millions of euros in donations from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. He denies all the allegations against him. Like this story?

271,"Two waves of Iranian missiles rained down overnight on two military installations housing US and coalition troops one in Al-Asad and one in Erbil. The strikes were heavy on symbolism with Iranian leadership making sure that the US gets the message right. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the attack – codenamed 'Martyr Soleimani' after the slain commander of Iran's clandestine Quds Force – was ""a slap in the face"" for the US. Echoing his words President Hassan Rouhani said Tehran's ""final answer"" to Soleimani's killing would be to ""kick all US forces out of the region."" Washington has been conspicuously mute in the aftermath of the missile attack. While Donald Trump optimistically wrote that all was ""well"" by Wednesday morning there was no mutual exchange of threats unlike earlier this week. As the world braces itself for what may come RT reached out to some international pundits who revealed noteworthy details about the strikes and tried to foresee what the future holds.  One of the targets for the attack was an airbase visited by both President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence ""so it has this kind of symbolism"" Middle East-based journalist and writer Ali Rizk told RT. Iran has ""numerous allies in Iraq"" which represents ""the easiest place"" to carry out a retaliatory strike and ""make life difficult for the Americans."" Notably enough Baghdad didn't protest against the strikes with Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi revealing that he'd received a verbal message from Iran warning of their response to the assassination of Soleimani with a reassurance that it would be restricted to US military deployed in Iraq. Operation 'Martyr Soleimani' made headlines in international media but it's unclear up to the time of writing if it inflicted any losses on US and Western forces. The bases in question were already put on alert as were all other American facilities across Iraq. ""The ball is in the US' [court] right now. It can lick its wounds and end this or it can retaliate in which case there will be tit-for-tat spiraling out of control into an all-out war which is not in the interests of Iran or the United States or anybody else in the region"" Kaveh Afrasiabi a US-based academic who advised Iranian negotiators during previous nuclear talks told RT. US-Iran relations are at a ""very critical threshold"" Afrasiabi added. Trump who vowed to make a statement on Thursday morning now faces ""important decisions"" which could shape the Middle East for years to come. Some hardliners including Senator Lindsey Graham (Rep-SC) called Iran's revenge ""an act of war"" while Senator Marco Rubio (Rep-FL) called on Americans to ""respond appropriately."" This risks ratcheting up the conflict with Iran the analyst noted. Dan Kovalik peace activist and labor attorney was much more pessimistic suggesting the Soleimani assassination was actually an attempt to force Iran into taking the first shots of war. ""Truthfully I believe that the murder of General Soleimani was done in order to provoke this type of response [from Iran]. The people in charge of the US government at this point want a war with Iran and they were looking to create a provocation"" he argued. The attacks were ""carefully calibrated"" to avoid major escalation in the aftermath suggested Sreeram Chaulia a professor and dean at India's Jindal School of International Affairs. Iranians don't want the kind of confrontation in which US troops will stay in the region indefinitely thus putting pressure on Iran's security. They believe they can outperform the Americans in the long run Chaulia explained. ""The idea is that eventually they can run out the clock and the Americans will leave"" he said referring to a Pentagon leak saying it was ready to reposition their forces and withdraw from Iraq. At the moment Tehran is holding back ""because one they don't want war as they clearly said but two they take smaller actions of this sort continuously.""  Top Iranian officials called the attack ""a proportionate response"" to Soleimani's assassination but in the meantime they signaled that any coercive action will be met with force.

272,"I did not escape justice. I fled injustice and political persecution” Ghosn told a conference room packed with international journalists in Beirut Lebanon. The businessman who was due to face trial for embezzlement and under-reporting his income in Japan said that fleeing the country was “the most difficult decision” of his life. However he said that he had no other choice as his family was allegedly in danger. Ghosn claims that Japanese officials told him: “It will be over if you just confess. If you don’t confess not only are we going to go after you we are going to go after your family.”  He said he was treated “brutally” by police who “spent 14 months trying to break my spirit barring any contact with my wife.” The businessman with French Lebanese and Brazilian nationality who essentially saved Nissan from bankruptcy two decades ago disappointed the press by saying he wasn’t planning to reveal how he managed to escape from Japan before the New Year. Some reports claim that Ghosn who had been under house arrest since spring of last year used public transport to get from Tokyo to Osaka where he was carried aboard a private jet inside a crate used for transporting musical instruments.  “I am here to talk about why I left” the 65-year-old pointed out blaming the Japanese justice system for violating his basic human rights and being particularly strict on foreigners. He said all charges against him were “baseless” and claimed that the real reason for his persecution was his work to deepen the alliance between Nissan and French car-maker Renault. “Some of my Japanese friends thought that the only way to get rid of the influence of Renault on Nissan was to get rid of me” he explained.  He claims his arrest was a result of “collusion between Nissan and the prosecutors” who did what the company told them. The businessman said he was eager to clear his name and find justice elsewhere if it was impossible to do so in Japan. Tokyo prosecutors were left unimpressed with Ghosn’s press-conference saying that the man was unable to justify his escape from the country. They also branded the businessman’s allegations of conspiracy between them and Nissan as “false.” Instead the prosecutors insisted that Ghosn had only himself to blame for his troubles and vowed to keep working to bring him back to Japan for trial.

Mark Latunski is charged with open murder and mutilation of a body after reportedly confessing to stabbing 25-year-old Kevin Bacon in the back slitting his throat and hanging him by his ankles from the rafters of his home in Morrice - only to later cut off and eat the dead man’s testicles. Latunski’s lawyer has filed an insanity plea citing a history of mental illness including four court-ordered stays in an institution. Latunski believes he is a member of a royal family from Wales with another name his lawyer claimed on Wednesday. The judge has ordered a forensic evaluation. Bacon a hairstylist met Latunski on Christmas Eve through Grindr and was reported missing by his family the next morning when he failed to turn up for Christmas breakfast. His car was found near his home with his belongings inside – including his phone which allowed police to trace his likely location based on conversations with Latunski on the app. Police found his body still hanging from the rafters of Latunski’s home on December 28 and arrested the confessed cannibal. Michigan State Police have widened the scope of their investigation to include two other recent incidents at Latunski’s home and the FBI has also gotten involved. In November police were called to the residence after a 29-year-old man was seen running from the scene with blood on his face screaming for help and clad only in a leather kilt - but the man didn’t press charges and it was determined at the time that no crime had been committed. A man from New York had fled the home the previous month and called police in a similar case but no charges were filed then either. Latunski was charged with kidnapping in 2013 for allegedly absconding with two of the four children he had with his ex-wife but that case was dismissed. Like this story?

READ MORE: Turkish troops start moving toward Libya – Erdogan Libya is currently contested by the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) and the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR) the latter backed up by General Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA).  Haftar’s forces spent much of 2019 advancing west toward Tripoli at one point threatening to storm the capital. Turkey intervened on the side of the GNA last week and began sending ground troops toward the North African nation over the weekend under the auspices of providing “coordination and stability” for the UN-backed GNA government. Russia has been careful not to pick sides despite talks with Haftar in Moscow earlier in the year. The Russian government nonetheless criticized Turkey’s siding with the GNA with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stating late last month that “foreign interference will hardly help the situation.”  Ankara has ruled out the possibility of clashing with Russia in Libya with Erdogan adviser and Chief EU negotiator Omer Celik saying on Monday it was “out of the question.” Erdogan’s decision to send troops led Haftar to declare “jihad” on Turkey and the general vowed to throw the “invaders” out of his country. Meanwhile the Tobruk parliament cut all diplomatic ties with Turkey and accused GNA Prime Minister Fayez Al-Sarraj of treason for inviting Turkish forces in. Once an oil-rich and prosperous nation Libya remains fractured and devastated since longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed by rebel forces in 2011 with the backing of a NATO bombing campaign. With Gaddafi removed the country degenerated into a no-man’s-land blighted by militia clashes jihadism and human trafficking. A Russia-Turkey brokered ceasefire in Libya would be “very difficult” to make happen because while the main conflict is between two players — Haftar’s forces and the UN-backed Sarraj government — it’s “more complicated” than that since there are additional forces at play including ISIS and other warlords political analyst Chris Bambery told RT. Bambery said that the UN-backed government is only “hanging on in a coastal strip of the country” and has “very little control” over Libya. Therefore it would be unlikely to see Haftar’s side backing off just when it appears to be nearing victory he said. Still Russia and Turkey do hold “some sway” in Libya and both seem keen to pull the ceasefire off he added. The situation may also be complicated by the fact that other international players are also involved including Haftar-backers Egypt and Saudi Arabia which Bambery said may not be interested in paying attention to a deal brokered between Moscow and Ankara.

273,In recent years NASA scientists have been perplexed by matter that seemed to be traveling so fast that it appeared to break the laws of physics. However now thanks to the photogenic black hole at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy they have finally gotten to the bottom of the mind-bending celestial speed demon.  The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration released images of the black hole the first ever photographed to much fanfare last April. While sifting through data from observations made in 2012 and 2017 scientists from the international partnership observed a jet of high energy particles and matter being blasted from the center of the black hole at apparent speeds of 6.3 times and 2.4 times the speed of light. Now this black hole located some 55 million light years away is truly gargantuan with a mass of about 6.5 billion times that of the sun so its gravity packs quite a punch but surely not one that could defy the laws of the universe itself?  Boffins have finally unraveled the peculiar mystery and the answer lies in a strange occurrence called superluminal motion. “One of the unbreakable laws of physics is that nothing can move faster than the speed of light” explained one of the paper’s co-authors Brad Snios of the Harvard &amp; Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). “We haven’t broken physics but we have found an example of an amazing phenomenon called superluminal motion.”  Superluminal motion occurs when an object is close to our line of sight making it look like it is somehow breaking the laws of physics because the source of the light appears to constantly overtake the incoming light as we observe it.  The incredible speeds were clocked through analysis of the particle stream in radio optical wavelengths. But when researchers using Chandra’s x-ray instruments tracked two beams blasted from the black hole at relativistic speeds about 900 and 2500 light years away from the region they were able to crack the mystery.  Using this “cosmic speed gun” method the scientists discovered that the particles could travel at more than 99 percent of the speed of light but they could not outrun physics itself. “It’s like the Event Horizon Telescope is giving a close-up view of a rocket launcher” said the CfA’s Paul Nulsen another co-author of the study “and Chandra is showing us the rockets in flight.”  Like this story?

274,Liridon Saliuka 29 who was born in Kosovo and held a British passport was reportedly found unresponsive in his prison cell on the evening of January 2. An investigation has been launched and it’s understood that authorities are treating his death as self-inflicted which his family disputes. He’s the third prisoner to have died in Belmarsh in less than a year. A fellow inmate was found dead in the notorious London facility in November.  Saliuka’s family claim there have been delays to the postmortem. His sister Dita revealed that her brother was involved in a car crash two years ago that left him requiring major reconstructive surgery. He was given metal plates that made it hard for him to walk or stand for long periods of time. A report by a surgeon commissioned by his defense lawyer had determined that he should be considered as “permanently disabled.” However his family say he had recently been transferred from a special cell to a standard one. Belmarsh is also the prison where Assange is currently being held ahead of an extradition hearing. UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Nils Melzer sent a letter to the UK government in December asking it to end the detention of Assange and warned that his health may soon reach a “critical” stage including the risk of death.

275,Speaking from the White House Trump backed away from threatening further strikes against Iran describing Tehran’s stand-down as “a good thing for all parties concerned.” Trump did however vow to impose new economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic in addition to the thousand or so imposed since the US withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA or Iran nuclear deal) in 2018. “These powerful sanctions will remain” he said “until Iran changes its behavior.” “Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism” Trump continued. “Time has come for the United Kingdom Germany France Russia and China to recognize this reality. They must now break away from the remnants of the JCPOA.” While Trump recently declared that the US would wipe out 52 Iranian state and cultural targets if American interests were attacked he struck a more conciliatory tone in his speech on Wednesday. After boasting about America’s “big missiles” Trump suggested that under a new deal Iran could become a “great country” and could cooperate with the US on areas of mutual benefit. “ISIS [Islamic State IS ISIL] is the natural enemy of Iran” he said. “The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran. And we should work together on this and many other shared priorities.” Early on Wednesday Iran rained a barrage of missiles on two military bases used by American troops in Iraq. The missile attack came in response to the drone assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani by the US in Baghdad on Friday. Soleimani according to Washington had orchestrated a series of attacks on American forces in Iraq and was allegedly plotting further strikes through Iranian-backed militias in the country. Tehran called the killing an act of “international terrorism” vowing to take revenge. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif described the missile attack as a “proportionate measure” taken in self-defense. Zarif added that Tehran does not intend to escalate the situation further but would target US allies in the region if Washington responds with force. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the strikes served as a “slap in the face” for the United States but were not “sufficient” to remove “the corrupting presence of America in the region.” READ MORE: Kicking all US troops out of Middle East will be Iran’s ‘final answer’ to Soleimani’s assassination – Rouhani Like this story?

276,After Iranian missiles struck several US bases Tuesday night #Resistance twitter wasted no time disavowing the administration they blamed for the hostilities running into the arms of his arch-rival with the #IVotedforHillaryClinton hashtag. But claiming Clinton was the less warlike of the two candidates or would have steered the country away from war with Iran requires a serious divergence from history. The former Secretary of State once told an interviewer that “I want the Iranians to know that if I’m the president we will attack Iran.” That was during her 2008 campaign and in the middle of a discussion about Iran possibly attacking Israel. Perhaps her stance on the Islamic republic had softened a bit by 2016 enough to justify viewing her as the lesser of two Iran hawks? Nope. The months leading up to that election saw her parroting Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s decades-old talking points about Iran “racing toward a nuclear capability” expanding “secret facilities” and “defying their international obligations” before she swept in with the nuclear deal and solved all the problems.  Except the deal was negotiated after she was replaced as the top US diplomat by John Kerry. Clinton was on the same side as Trump demanding ever more sanctions even as the nuclear deal took effect this time as punishment for Iran’s ballistic missile program.  Beyond interventionist Democrats she was courted by a bevy of neocons who couldn’t stomach Trump’s anti-interventionist rhetoric. Inveterate warmongers like Robert Kagan and Richard Armitage swooned over the ex-First Lady.  In short order the infamous clip of Clinton mocking the brutal murder of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi – “we came we saw he died” – resurfaced on twitter. The so-called “humanitarian” intervention in Libya was largely a creation of Clinton’s State Department complete with risible wartime propaganda about Gaddafi handing out Viagra so his soldiers could better commit mass rapes and the continued chaos in that once-advanced state remains a testament to what the region (or world) might look like under her watch. She wanted a repeat performance in Syria calling for - and thankfully not getting - a no-fly zone even while admitting it would “kill a lot of Syrians.”  With all that in mind some speculated the true motive of the hashtag was avoiding responsibility.  Several tweeters agreed that Clinton was right about Trump - but in a case of the pot calling the kettle black. A few Clinton voters even aired their buyers’ remorse. Clinton herself couldn't resist weighing in with a smug GIF. While Trump lost the popular vote to Clinton he handily beat her in the Electoral College which ultimately decides who occupies the White House. Despite her massive advantage in political experience his promises to bring US troops home attracted significant support. Nearly four years later however the US is poised on the brink of a catastrophic expansion of its Forever War. Like this story?

277,A black SUV smashed into the portal of the church in the town of Sonseca in the central Toledo province early on Wednesday. The massive wooden doors withstood the initial impact while one passer-by thought that a crash had happened and approached the driver to ask about his condition.   But the man behind the wheel shouted obscenities at her and continued his attempts to get his car into the place of worship. The scared woman ran away and called the police. The doors eventually gave in and the powerful vehicle raced into the church throwing benches aside and stopping only a meter away from the altar. When officers arrived the unhinged driver told them that he was possessed by the devil and that the church was the only place where he could find shelter. He was identified as a local man who owned a shop celling products for cultivation of marijuana located just 800 meters away from the scene. The 35-year-old was hospitalized with minor injuries. Tests for alcohol and other substances were reportedly done on him but their results haven’t been yet revealed. Police sources said that the perpetrator may be put under arrest. Sonseca mayor Sergio Mora expressed relief that none of his citizens were wounded in the incident and offered the church assistance in the restoring the damage.

278,Al-Sadr made his pronouncement on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump gave a relatively subdued speech praising Iran’s restraint. Rather than call for retaliation against Iran over a strike that didn’t kill any Americans Trump merely vowed to impose even more sanctions on the Islamic Republic “until Iran changes its behavior.”  Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani in turn vowed to eventually kick all US troops “out of the region” as the “final answer” to the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani killed in a US airstrike last week. Shia religious leader al-Sadr also called on Iraqi militias to be “patient” and not begin any military actions claiming that a new “strong” government capable of protecting Iraq’s sovereignty would be formed in 15 days and hold early elections. However Iraq should still evict the foreign troops inside its borders he said. The Iraqi foreign ministry condemned Iran’s missile attack on the coalition bases declaring it a “violation of Iraqi sovereignty” in a statement on Wednesday and emphasizing Iraq was an “independent state.”  “We will not allow it to become a battlefield” the ministry added. Iraqi PM Adel Abdul Mahdi stepped down last month after months of massive protests calling for electoral reforms. He has remained in a “caretaker” role while Iraq’s political leaders attempt to move forward. Another prominent Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani warned last month that “foreign interference” in the process would not be tolerated. Like this story?

280,Trump backed away from the idea of striking Iran in a much-anticipated address on Wednesday as the two nations seemed to be on the brink of war over the US killing of top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. He did however double down on promises of more crippling sanctions. Paul told RT that while Trump’s decision not to escalate militarily was positive problems and dangers still exist because the president has “too many neocons around him trying to aggravate things.” He also called US sanctions on Iran an “act of war” in themselves and said that Americans would be outraged if another country engaged in economic warfare and blockades against Washington. “There’s a war going on” already through sanctions he said. Paul reiterated his long-standing view that the US should pull its troops out of Iraq and said that the US’s “monstrosity of an embassy” in Baghdad was just “provoking” people into attacks on US personnel. The former congressman and libertarian said that the US should be “very engaged” in the world but through diplomacy and trade rather than military aggression. He also said the narrative of Iran as the aggressor or initiating force behind recent tensions is misleading because in its position it simply “can’t afford to be” an aggressor. Like this story?

281,Israel has been developing laser weapons since the mid-1990s yet the most promising such weapon – the US-Israeli-developed Nautilus Tactical High Energy Laser – was shelved in 2006 in favor of continued reliance on the Iron Dome missile batteries. However research has continued in the meantime and Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett announced on Wednesday that a functioning laser defense system will be operational within a year and a half. The system will use multiple laser beams focused together and will work in adverse weather conditions the Jerusalem Post reported. Bennett said that the system “makes the security apparatus more lethal more powerful and more advanced.” “We will add a laser sword when dealing with threats from the north or the south” the minister said adding “the enemies of Israel better not test our resolve or our abilities.” The Israeli government’s goal is to use the system against rockets such as the Qassam commonly fired into Israel from Gaza. Defense Ministry research head Yaniv Rotem told the Jerusalem Post that the laser has been tested on “mortar shells drones and anti-tank missiles” in recent years. Crucially laser weapons are far cheaper to operate than missile batteries. Every successful Iron Dome interception costs thousands of dollars whereas a laser weapon costs only what electricity is used. It is also expected to be effective against low-flying drones and incendiary kites and balloons like those used by Palestinain rioters to set fire to Israeli farmlands near the Gaza border. ‘Star Wars’ capabilities are unlikely to deter Israel’s enemies from launching attacks on the Jewish state however. Despite the Iron Dome limiting the effectiveness of rocket strikes and the Israeli military’s often disproportionate response to Palestinian violence anger among those living in the occupied territories still regularly results in clashes and death. The country’s long-standing enmity with Iran has also seen its cities threatened with missile fire. As the US and Tehran stood on the brink of war this week Iranian leadership threatened on Wednesday to launch missiles at Haifa should the US respond with force to an Iranian attack on American bases in Iraq. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded in kind threatening to deal Iran a “most crushing blow” were the Islamic Republic to target Israel. Think your friends would be interested?

282,“I believe based on what I saw and what I know that [the strikes] were intended to cause structural damage destroy vehicles and equipment and aircraft and to kill personnel” Army General Mark Milley told reporters on Wednesday. “That's my own personal assessment” he added. “But the analytics is in the hands of professional intelligence analysts. So they're looking at that.” Milley did not elaborate whether those were the same analysts who “assessed” the truthfulness of the now-debunked ‘Russiagate’ or the equally phantom existence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction used to justify the 2003 invasion.  The overnight attacks on Al-Asad airbase and Erbil involved over a dozen ballistic missiles fired by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in revenge for the US drone strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani one of the IRGC’s top commanders.  The Iraqi government confirmed that it had received advance warning about the strikes from Iran enabling US troops to take precautionary measures and activate their “finest in the world” air defenses. No lives were lost as a result.  Both Iran and the US declared victory and stood down on Wednesday morning with US President Donald Trump describing the outcome as “a good thing for all parties concerned.” It was a stunning turn from Tuesday’s hard line championed by Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and not everyone at the Pentagon seems happy about it if Milley’s comments are anything to go by. Pentagon officials sent to Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers on the almost-war apparently didn’t do too well either. Emerging from the classified briefing Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) gave a blistering denunciation of what he heard as “probably the worst briefing I've seen at least on a military issue” adding that the military could not name a single instance in which they would feel it necessary to ask for congressional approval. Exact details of the briefing are classified but Lee hinted that the military apparently told lawmakers that they could not debate or discuss the strike that killed Soleimani or whether a military intervention against Iran was legal as that would signal division and weakness to Tehran. “It is not acceptable for officials within the executive branch of government…to come in and tell us that we can't debate and discuss the appropriateness of military intervention against Iran” Lee fumed afterward. “It's un-American. It's unconstitutional and it's wrong.” Lee and fellow Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) said the briefing convinced them to change their mind and support the War Powers resolution proposed by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) Hillary Clinton’s 2016 running mate. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story! , https://www.rt.com/usa/477762-general-iran-strikes-intended-kill/,None
283,Air raid sirens can be heard in video footage presumably captured in the Iraqi capital on Wednesday night. Multiple journalists in the city reported that two explosions rang out apparently coming from the direction of the heavily-fortified ‘Green Zone’ home to the US embassy. Iraq’s military said that “two Katyusha rockets fell inside the Green Zone without causing casualties.” Police sources told Reuters that the rockets came within 100 meters of the US embassy and caused a fire. The Green Zone was besieged by protesters last week following an American strike on an Iraqi Shia militia group near the Syrian border that killed at least 25 fighters. Days later the US assassinated Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike at Baghdad airport driving the US and Iran to the brink of war. Following a retaliatory missile attack on two American bases in the early hours of Wednesday morning tensions simmered back down later in the day as US President Donald Trump opted not to respond with force.

284,Trudeau said Canada’s foreign minister would speak with his Iranian counterpart to discuss the need for a probe but added it would be “dangerous” to speculate about the cause of the crash at this early stage. Nonetheless he said he expected Canada would have a role in any investigation into the incident. The PM also noted that he had spoken to US President Donald Trump about the incident earlier on Wednesday. The Ukrainian flight – a Boeing 737-800 – went down over Tehran on Tuesday night after an apparent technical failure with Iranian officials stating the plane’s engine caught fire before it crashed. All 167 passengers as well as 9 crew members were killed. Insisting on carrying out its own independent probe Tehran earlier refused to hand the plane’s black box to Boeing but said Ukrainian officials will be allowed to be “present during investigations.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a team of experts would be dispatched to Iran to help determine the cause of the crash and to “establish the truth and those responsible for this terrible catastrophe.” While Kiev revoked its initial statement pinning the crash on an equipment malfunction without explanation Zelensky has also urged the public to refrain from speculating about what happened.

285,“Truth and Lies: Jeffrey Epstein” is due to air Thursday on ABC the network tweeted on Wednesday as the country stood poised on the brink of war with Iran and one might assume relatively few eyes were on the Epstein saga – for once. James O’Keeffe of Project Veritas was quick to take credit for the long-suppressed footage seeing daylight – assuming of course the special ABC plans to broadcast bears any resemblance to the investigation by anchor Amy Robach that was mysteriously spiked by network management three years ago. In November the conservative muckraker published a hot-mic tape of Robach ranting about ABC’s suppression of her work revealing the network had been sitting on a bombshell. Robach had interviewed Epstein victim Virginia Roberts who supposedly implicated former president Bill Clinton the UK’s Prince Andrew lawyer Alan Dershowitz and other big names – with photographic proof – and found other women to back up her story long before the Miami Herald investigation that reopened the case in December 2018. The news that the network had spiked such a significant investigation reverberated all the way up through Congress. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California) wrote to ABC requesting a copy of the interview with Roberts as well as information about why (and by whom) the story was killed. In a letter co-signed by two of McCarthy’s fellow Republicans he excoriated the network for prioritizing “financial interests” and “outside forces” over getting to the bottom of Epstein’s (alleged) human trafficking operation. The news that an Epstein special – perhaps the fabled Robach special (though the clips ABC posted tellingly included no trace of the anchor) was finally going to grace the network’s airwaves provoked excitement and trepidation on social media. Many assumed the network had been in overdrive since Veritas dropped the hot-mic tape editing the material to expunge any awkward revelations. Just the leak of the Robach tape provoked a mad scramble at the network to find and exile the leaker leading to the firing of an innocent woman from a rival network. Others guessed they would still find some way not to broadcast it. The well-connected sex offender may be dead but his secrets are very much alive after all. Like this story?

286,Speaking at the CES convention in Las Vegas on Wednesday Twitter’s director of product management Suzanne Xie announced they would be giving users a new “conversation participants” option sometime this year. The option will allow posters to set replies on their tweets from “global group panel and statement.” The options would control the ability of other users to reply ranging from anyone (global) to no one (statement) with only those mentioned (panel) or specifically selected (group) in between. Xie said that the feature is still in development and is an “experiment we’re going to run” in the first quarter of 2020 before launching it globally later in the year. The new feature is intended to limit the power of trolls and combat abuse according to the company. To that end Twitter has already given users the option of hiding replies stating that “everyone should feel safe and comfortable while talking on Twitter.” However this is still a manual process a laborious task for prolific figures on the platform – such as President Donald Trump for instance. With Twitter being all about discussion and argument the news angered many users who suggested that limiting replies could stifle debate and allow false information from politicians journalists and public figures to go unchecked. Progressive journalist Max Blumenthal mocked the idea as the “Elite Accountability Insulation button” designed to protect “Beltway hacks and foreign policy insiders.” “Powerful people don’t like being talked back to” conservative pundit Stephen Miller tweeted “so Twitter now just becomes a newspaper the medium it killed.” Should Trump protect his tweets with the “statement” option droves of #Resistance commenters who obsessively rain scorn on every one of his messages will likely be devastated. Twitter’s previous attempts to shape discussion on its platform have often been ham-fisted. Critics have long accused the company of secretly suppressing unsavory content a charge it vigorously denied. However a change to the site’s terms of service late last year for the first time acknowledged this stating that the firm may “limit distribution or visibility” of content and “suspend or terminate users” as it sees fit. Back in 2018 Twitter announced it would de-rank posts from what it called “troll accounts.” That was also met with controversy as critics accused the social media giant of censorship. The platform’s aggressive “hateful conduct” rules have also been slammed as biased and arbitrary. Like this story?

287,The Ain Al-Asad military base in Iraq’s Anbar province as well as another facility outside Erbil in the Iraqi Kurdistan found themselves under fire by two volleys of ballistic missiles fired from inside Iran during the night between Tuesday and Wednesday. Satellite imagery released on Wednesday by the private US company Planet Labs shows only minor damage in both places mostly to warehouses and equipment storage facilities rather than barracks. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) launched the missiles as revenge for the US drone strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani one of their top commanders last week outside of Baghdad. Despite belligerent rhetoric that accompanied the missiles Iran stood down after just two volleys claiming its legitimate self-defense objectives were met. US President Donald Trump likewise declared “all is well” declined to respond with force and commended Tehran’s decision as “a good thing for all parties concerned.” No US or Iraqi soldiers were killed in the strikes. The Pentagon claimed its early warning systems caught the launches allowing US troops to seek shelter. The Iraqi government revealed on Wednesday that Iran actually called and warned them of the strike in advance which they then passed on to Washington. Finland and Lithuania which also have troops stationed at the two bases also reportedly said they were informed of the strikes in advance. All of this has prompted speculation that the Iranian missile strikes were more of a symbolic act than a true escalation of the ongoing conflict between Tehran and Washington. Iran proved it had the capability to kill US troops if it so chose but deliberately refrained from it argued former US Marine and UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter. The top US general however claimed on Wednesday that his “personal assessment” was that the IRGC was shooting to kill. “I believe based on what I saw and what I know that [the strikes] were intended to cause structural damage destroy vehicles and equipment and aircraft and to kill personnel” Army General Mark Milley told reporters.

288,The suspects “conspired and conducted religious classes with the objective of establishing Islamic rule in India through violent jihad and promoting unlawful activities” India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) said in a statement on Wednesday. The accused were charged with criminal conspiracy for their role in the religious courses and most have already been taken into custody as part of an ongoing investigation the agency added. Dubbed the “Ansarullah case” – or “Supporters of God” in Arabic – the probe was first opened last July when investigators uncovered a burgeoning terror cell with links to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The cell proselytized a violent message through courses on how to wage “jihad” and create an Islamic “caliphate.” The group was also thought to have collected funds to finance a terror operation in India. Police raids in both India and the UAE last year led to the arrest of 16 suspects five of which were thought to have ties to the notorious Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) terrorist outfit. It is unclear whether any of the 11 named in Wednesday’s charge sheet were affiliated with any other known militant groups. Like this story?

289,The spate of severe pneumonia cases may be linked to a family of microbes known as “coronaviruses” the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday adding that it would need to collect more data to confirm the suspicion. “The initial information about the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan ... pointed to a coronavirus as a possible pathogen causing this cluster” the WHO said in a statement referring to a city in eastern China where 59 cases of pneumonia have been observed in the last month. Coronaviruses encompass a wide range of ailments from the common cold all the way to SARS the deadly respiratory disease which swept dozens of countries in a series of flare-ups in the early 2000s. Though Chinese researchers have ruled out SARS in the recent outbreak – as well as bird flu adenovirus and other common respiratory infections – the WHO said a “novel coronavirus” currently unknown to science could instead be at work. Unlike SARS which spreads with relative ease Chinese scientists say the new bug does not appear to be exceptionally contagious one sign that another culprit is behind the upsurge in pneumonia. The same illness may have also spread to Hong Kong and South Korea with similar reports of respiratory infections from people who recently traveled to Wuhan. Fifteen such patients are now being treated in Hong Kong with only one known case in South Korea. Because of the rash of infections the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert on Wednesday urging physicians around the world to watch out for the novel coronavirus especially in patients exhibiting pneumonia-like symptoms.

291,Asked about India’s pursuit of the S-400s during a press briefing on Wednesday a senior State Department official said the country enjoyed no special protection from US sanctions which Washington has also threatened to impose on Turkey over its own purchase of the missile platform. “There is not a blanket waiver. Congress certainly never designed that or anticipated that nor did the administration” he said adding:  Immediately following the low-key threat however the official noted there was no “blanket application” for sanctions on India either suggesting they would be applied on a “case-by-case” basis and could in theory be adjusted to be less “deep-cutting.” Any penalties on New Delhi would be imposed under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act – CAATSA for the short of breath – which was signed into law in 2017. Despite the bill’s name Washington has largely brandished the act as a warning to allied nations mulling weapons deals with Russia – namely Turkey and India – but has occasionally used it against so-called “adversaries” hitting China with secondary CAATSA sanctions in 2018. India has insisted that it be left to make its own arms purchases independently with the country’s external affairs minister stressing last November that New Delhi would “not be influenced by other countries on what we do in terms of our national security and defense.” The S-400 is Russia’s most advanced long-range air defense system available for export designed to intercept enemy aircraft and missiles. Washington argues the platform is ‘not compatible’ with NATO defense infrastructure and claims it poses a ‘threat’ to its 5th-gen F-35 stealth fighter jet. Like this story?

293,The fire broke out on Thursday night at a paper factory in New Delhi's industrial area prompting the capital's fire service to deploy 33 engines to deal with the incident. As they fought the blaze one worker was found dead inside the three-story building. Footage and photos shared on social media showed plumes of thick smoke coming out of the factory. The fire was extinguished by Thursday morning officials said and an investigation into the incident will now be launched. It comes just a month after an inferno killed as many as 43 people at an illegal bag-and-paper factory near central Delhi. The victims were trapped inside and narrow lanes made it difficult for rescuers to reach the burning facility on time. Think your friends would be interested?

298,Eyewitnesses observed a fire on the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 while it was still airborne Iran's civil aviation organization noted. The aircraft attempted to return to Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport before crashing killing all 176 people on board the organization said. The Iranian investigators confirmed that no distress calls or messages were received from the pilot before the plane hit the ground. Ali Abedzadeh who leads the civil aviation organization stated that all relevant countries have been invited to send representatives to help carry out the ongoing investigation into what caused Wednesday's crash. His organization said that all of its findings would be published and publicly available. Ukraine had initially issued a statement claiming that the crash was due to an engine fire but later retracted the statement. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that his government was considering several possible causes of accident but urged the public against speculating and spreading conspiracy theories. Kiev has already dispatched investigators to Iran according to reports. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry revealed that the crash victims included 82 Iranians 11 Ukrainians 63 Canadians four Afghans three Germans three British nationals and 10 Swedes. The crash occurred shortly after an Iranian missile attack on US bases in Iraq prompting theories that Tehran may have accidentally shot down the plane. However five security sources told Reuters that the initial assessment of Western intelligence agencies was that the aircraft had suffered from a mechanical malfunction. Like this story?

300,Former Ljungby politician Rashad Alasaad 27 was arrested by ten undercover police officers during a raid at his home on Wednesday morning. “The person was taken for questioning and subsequently arrested. He is entitled to a public defender and that is being arranged” said police spokesman Ewa-Gun Westford. Swedish paper Expressen recorded Alasaad with a hidden camera joking about how he had smuggled several people into Sweden for money after entering the country along the smuggling route from Turkey and offering to help smuggle a child from Greece to Sweden.  “Yes I got my whole family out. I got a lot of people out. It’s not difficult at all” Alasaad said on camera. “Let me tell you why I’m doing it. To be honest the main reason is money. I want money.” Sweden’s Border Police launched an initial inquiry after the video was made public. He initially denied the allegations but when confronted about a suspected price list 20000 Swedish krona (approximately €1900) per child and 30000 krona (€2860) per adult Alasaad admitted the list was authentic.  He also reportedly ran Facebook ads under a fake name offering to smuggle migrants from Greece to Sweden using borrowed passports.  “Only those who are in Greece. Syrian passports with Swedish residence permit for sale. Only for those who look like passport holders” he allegedly wrote on Facebook though he’d previously flatly denied the allegations. Alasaad left office shortly after the video revelations came to light having joined the local council after the 2018 elections running with for the ruling Social Democratic party.  He reportedly also worked for Sweden’s social security and tax agencies as well as for the state pension fund before running for office in the local council.

301,Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Abdollah Araghi said that Iran would take “harsher revenge soon” without specifying what that might entail Tasnim news agency reported on Thursday. The deputy head of the IRGC Ali Fadavi described Iran’s missile attacks on US forces as a display of the Islamic Republic’s military capabilities claiming that the Americans “couldn’t do a damn thing” about the strikes. Earlier President Hassan Rouhani said that Iran’s ultimate goal in retaliation against the assassination of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani is the complete removal of US forces from the region. Iran’s supreme leader described the missile strike as a “slap in the face” for the US but said that the attack was not “sufficient” to remove “the corrupting presence of America in the region.” Tehran defended the strikes as a legitimate act of self-defense. US President Donald Trump said that Washington would respond with more sanctions while reserving the right to take further military action against Iran in the future. The escalation has prompted calls from the international community for an easing of US-Iran tensions. Like this story?

304,"A new study used a special camera imaging system called CDose custom-built to capture light emissions during the radiotherapy.  During the experiment at the heart of the study the patient reported seeing flashes of light. Follow-up studies were performed on pigs' eyes and allowed researchers to further identify the type and composition of the light confirming that it was indeed the long-suspected culprit Cherenkov radiation.  Cherenkov radiation or Cherenkov emissions occur as a radiation beam passes through the fluid in the eye producing light inside the organ. It is the same phenomenon that causes nuclear reactors to glow blue. ""Our newest data is exciting because for the first time light emission from the eye of a patient undergoing radiotherapy was captured"" says biomedical engineer Irwin Tendler from Dartmouth College. The discovery might help improve the accuracy of radiotherapy in the future affording doctors more information about whether the radiation beam hit its intended target or not. It may also prevent vision loss in patients if a causal link to the light flashes can be established. ""Although theories regarding direct nerve stimulation scintillation of the lens and ultraweak bioluminescent photons cannot be ruled out it seems clear that Cherenkov light production throughout the eye is quantifiable and significant"" conclude the researchers in their published paper.

305, Shyam Chaurasia from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh has developed a new patent-pending personal security device which makes women’s lips pop almost as loudly as their would-be attackers’ ear drums if test footage of the accessory is anything to go by. The ‘lipstick gun’ is reportedly fitted into an additional space inside a normal lipstick case. When triggered it sets off a loud bang alerting people in the vicinity while also sending a distress signal to the police via the 112 emergency number.  “If a woman is caught in an uncomfortable situation she can simply press the button fitted in the socket. This will trigger a loud explosion-like sound and also send a message to 112. It is easy to carry and since it is fitted to the normal lipstick it will not raise any doubts” Chaurasia who spent a month developing the gadget said. The device is chargeable and can be connected to a smart phone via bluetooth. Charausia has submitted a patent for the implement which is currently pending and he hopes to eventually sell the personal security pucker-up for Rs 600 ($8.40). “It is convenient to carry and creates a scare with its explosion sound. When you take it out no one will suspect because it looks like a lipstick” Shefali Rai a student of Benaras Hindu University who gave the lipstick a test-run said. This isn’t Chaurasia’s first foray into the world of personal protection and outlandish gadgetry. His previous expertise includes developing a (semi) functional suit of Iron Man-esque armor.

306,In a study published on Thursday scientists show how their potentially paradigm-shifting method known as FLASH radiotherapy has the same effect on tumors as traditional radiation therapy and it gets the job done in a fraction of the time. Boffins from the University of Pennsylvania’s Abramson Cancer Center have taken the first steps in making the revolutionary treatment a reality by detailing how they used proton radiation to generate the dosage needed to theoretically give a cancer patient their entire course of radiotherapy in just one brief sitting. The study also found that the FLASH method was less harmful to healthy tissue because of the shorter exposure time. “This is the first time anyone has published findings that demonstrate the feasibility of using protons rather than electrons to generate FLASH doses with an accelerator currently used for clinical treatments” explained the study’s co-senior author James M Metz. Previous groups of researchers have tried the approach with conventional photons but currently available treatment devices failed to generate the necessary dosage.  The high levels of radiation required to deliver the treatment rapidly saturate radiation detectors so the University of Pennsylvania team had to develop the tools needed to effectively and accurately measure treatment doses.  “We’ve been able to develop specialized systems in the research room to generate FLASH doses demonstrate that we can control the proton beam and perform a large number of experiments to help us understand the implications of FLASH radiation that we simply could not have done with a more traditional research setup” Metz said. The team say they are already beginning to optimize how they would use their techniques in clinical trials. Like this story?

309,"The Rok stone created in the ninth century in south central Sweden bears the longest runic inscription known in the world. Scholars have put forward a number of theories about the meaning behind the 700 inscriptions including that the stone may have honored a lost son or served as a way to preserve tribal myths. Its cryptic etchings have now inspired a new interpretation: the runestone was erected by Vikings who prophesized a climate crisis in Scandinavia. The theory has been hatched by researchers hailing from three Swedish universities. The team of academics — which included specialists in the fields of philology archaeology and the history of religion — concluded that the ancient inscription “deals with an anxiety triggered by a son's death and the fear of a new climate crisis similar to the catastrophic one after 536 CE.” Temperatures in Scandinavia plunged in the sixth century destroying crops and causing widespread hunger. The researchers believe that when the runes speak of battles being waged over hundreds of years they’re actually alluding to ""the conflict between light and darkness warmth and cold life and death.” Coincidentally the world’s best-known climate activist Greta Thunberg also hails from Sweden.

310,Iran launched a volley of ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq in the early hours of Wednesday morning bringing the two countries to the brink of war. However no American or Iraqi casualties were sustained and US President Donald Trump responded with economic sanctions instead of military action. Speaking on Iranian state television on Thursday the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) aerospace commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh elaborated on the operation the previos day. Hajizadeh added that expelling American troops from the Middle East would be “appropriate revenge” for the death of IRGC Major General Qassem Soleimani who the US assassinated in a drone strike at Baghdad airport on Friday. He said that the attack would be the start of a series of similar strikes across the region. Trump thanked an “early warning system” for tipping the US military off about the incoming Iranian missiles on Wednesday morning averting casualties at the bases. However the Iraqi government confirmed that it received advance warning of the strikes enabling US troops to take precautionary measures and activate air defense systems. Nevertheless the missiles struck with pinpoint accuracy demonstrating the advancement of Tehran’s military technology in recent years. Earlier in the day  IRGC commander Abdollah Araghi also said that Iran would take “harsher revenge soon” without elaborating further. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei both stated that the Islamic Republic’s ultimate goal is the removal of US troops from the Middle East. Like this story?

312,The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) found that offenders from England and Wales are going overseas to “commit extensive abuse of children” including in Asia and Africa. It said travel restrictions are too infrequently placed on offenders to restrict them from taking advantage of children in poor and corrupt countries who may be all the more vulnerable. Chair of the Inquiry Professor Alexis Jay claims the issue is an “urgent problem” the UK cannot hide from. He explained that there were “gaps in our legal system” that were allowing known offenders to target children in developing countries which was “simply not acceptable.” As of March 31 2018 just 0.2 percent of the 58637 registered sex offenders in England and Wales had their overseas travel restricted. The report highlighted high-profile cases including that of singer Gary Glitter (real name Paul Gadd) who sexually abused children in Asia after being convicted of possessing indecent pictures of kids in the UK. Another notorious offender to be singled out was Richard Huckle - known as “Britain's worst paedophile.” He was convicted in 2016 of 71 counts of serious sexual assaults against children while employed as a teacher in Malaysia.

313,The US attacks on Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) known in Arabic as Hashd al-Shaabi prompted the Iraqi government “to resume negotiations regarding the S-300 deal” Mohammad Ridha chairman of Iraqi parliament’s Security and Defense Committee told Sputnik on Thursday. The US military have launched the air strikes against the PMU units in late December blaming them for an attack that killed an American civilian contractor. The Shia militia force backed by Iran later said it lost 25 fighters. It started a vicious chain of events beginning with fiery anti-American demonstrations near the US Embassy in Baghdad. Though no one from the US diplomatic staff was hurt the Pentagon responded with brute force killing a top Iranian general who they said masterminded the unrest and ratcheting up tensions around Iran.  Now Ridha said he’s unaware of the stage the talks are currently in but mentioned the deal was greenlighted by Iraqi leadership. In his view the prospective purchase won’t sit well with the Americans: “We await US opposition on this issue.” Washington has piled enormous pressure on nations that have bought Russian-made air defense systems or considering buying them. Turkey has been targeted with an array of US penalties for procuring the S-400 while India another prospective operator of the system faces similar ramifications.

Therefore Russia is interested in the Arctic remaining a 'zone of peace and cooperation a fresh report by the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS) which was seen by RT read. But with the rivalry of superpowers – the US Russia and China – intensifying in the region it's the stance of Washington that is causing concerns as the Americans believe that Moscow and Beijing must be ""contained and suppressed"" the report said. DIIS which prepares researches for Denmark's government and parliament said that Washington remains a key ally to Copenhagen but acknowledged that it's not always easy to work with the Americans. One of the stark examples of such unpredictability were Donald Trump's attempts to persuade Denmark to sell Greenland to the US last year. But Danish PM Mette Frederiksen firmly rejected the offer stating that the island was not for sale. Greenland is currently home to the northernmost base of the US Air Force Thule Air Base. The facility hosts the US Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) while also handling around 3000 flights every year. The think tank advised Denmark and other northern nations – Iceland Finland and Norway – to carefully monitor not only the regional activities of Russia and China but the US as well the think tank said. It's paramount for Denmark to boost its own potential in the Arctic in order to lower the dependence on the US and NATO DIIS researches said in the report.

317,Netflix was ordered to remove ‘The First Temptation of Christ’ a Christmas special by Brazilian comedy group Porta dos Fundos from its platform on Wednesday. Conservative Catholic organization Associacao Centro Dom Bosco de Fe e Cultura had claimed the film “attacked the protection of religious freedom” with its insulting portrayals of the Holy Family.   “The consequences of spreading and exhibiting this ‘artistic production’… are more likely to provoke more serious and irreparable damage than the movie’s suspension” state court judge Benedicto Abicair said. The movie incensed conservative Christians by depicting Jesus as a gay man bringing a boyfriend home to his family: a dimwitted Joseph and a lustful Mary. After its release last month the film was controversially received with petitions to remove it gaining over two million signatures. One particularly dedicated group of detractors even firebombed Porta dos Fundos’ offices in Rio de Janeiro on Christmas Eve filming the attack so there was no question about the cause of the fire (which was quickly contained) and boasting that they had acted against the filmmakers’ “blasphemous bourgeois and anti-patriotic attitude.”  Abicair’s ruling reversed a previous one by a lower court and may still be overturned according to local media. Netflix has the option of appealing to the entire court since the injunction was issued by a single judge.  The decision inspired the defenders of Porta dos Fundos (“backdoor” in Portuguese) to pry into the judge’s background where they discovered he has written articles slamming everything from scantily-clad airline passengers and unhygienic dog owners to ‘disrespectful’ clothing worn by lawyers.

It’s an ugly world out there.” Come again? Krugman was immediately savaged for what commenters saw as an act of pre-emptive ass-covering. “Good one @paulkrugman” one wrote. “I’m sure the @FBI will totally buy it.” As Krugman was dog-piled online he took the matter not to law enforcement but to his employers at the New York Times. After all where else would a smeared liberal journalist run to than into the protective arms of the liberal media. A short while later and evidently after a chat with his bosses Krugman tweeted “Times thinks it may have been a scam. Anyway will have more security in future.” So did Krugman a Nobel-prize-winning economist out himself as a pedophile for the whole world to see? Highly unlikely. Instead the 66-year-old writer likely fell for a ‘spearphishing’ scam in which pop-up ads or emails warn gullible computer users that child porn has been found on their PC usually accompanied with a request to hand over money to make the problem go away. Looking back through Krugman’s twitter feed it seems he’s not the most computer literate writer at the Times. Krugman has a history of falling for internet scams whether they’re attampts to hack his Facebook account or sign him up for sites offering “live sex cams.” He also has a history of making terrible predictions. In 1998 Krugman wrote that “the growth of the internet will slow drastically” and “by 2005 or so it will become clear that the internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.” He also predicted in 2016 that Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election would bring about “a global recession with no end in sight.” Neither have come true yet based on recent events the internet continues to regularly vex and frustrate Krugman. At least he hasn’t sent any money to Nigerian princes...yet. Like this story? Share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/477845-paul-krugman-child-porn/,None
320,"Despite its passage the bill lacks the teeth to actually curb Trump’s warmaking powers should he decide to take military action against Iran. As a ‘Concurrent Resolution’ it does not need Trump’s signature will not go on to the Republican-controlled Senate for approval and will not become law. Instead it simply expresses the position of the House. The bill was sponsored by former CIA analyst and Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin (Michigan) and calls on Trump to ""to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or against Iran"" unless Congress formally declares war on the Islamic Republic. The bill was written in the aftermath of the American assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani who was killed at Baghdad airport on Friday in a drone strike. Iran responded by launching a volley of ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq used by American troops. The attacks killed nobody with Baghdad reportedly forewarned and Trump declined to respond with force opting to place further economic sanctions on Iran instead. Despite the apparent cooldown House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called a vote on the bill regardless stating on Wednesday that “America and the world cannot afford war.” The power to declare war is held exclusively by Congress under The War Powers Resolution of 1973. Without Congressional authorization the President cannot commit troops to any foreign conflict for more than 60 days. However the resolution was allegedly violated by Bill Clinton when he ordered the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. Since 2001 the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) has allowed successive administrations to wage war against anyone they deemed “planned authorized committed or aided” the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Since its passing the act has been invoked 41 times to allow US military action in 19 countries including Afghanistan Iraq Syria Somalia and Yemen. However the AUMF may soon be scrapped too. Pelosi announced on Wednesday that the House may soon consider legislation to repeal and replace the act. In the hours leading up to Thursday’s vote Trump asked House Republicans to “vote against Crazy Nancy Pelosi’s War Powers Resolution” calling the resolution “Just another Democrat fraud” and “Presidential Harassment.” Think your friends would be interested?

321,A Downing Street spokesman revealed that British PM Boris Johnson had sought to establish the facts of the disaster in a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday. The Boeing 737-800 operated by Ukrainian International Airlines crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini Airport early Wednesday morning. Eyewitnesses have described seeing the aircraft engulfed in flames in the sky before it came down. Johnson has said that there needs to be “a full credible and transparent investigation into what happened” according to his spokesman. There is a body of information indicating the flight was shot down by an Iranian missile Johnson claimed later on Thursday. The remarks come after Oleksiy Danilov secretary of Ukraine’s Security Council told Ukrainian media that officials were working on a number of theories regarding the crash including that of a missile strike “as information has surfaced on the internet about elements of a missile being found near the site of the crash.”  Ukraine had initially suggested that the crash was due to an engine fire or another technical issue but later retracted the statement. President Zelensky cautioned the public against spreading conspiracy theories and speculating on what could have caused the crash – which has already been named the deadliest in the history of modern Ukraine.

322,"Trump told reporters on Thursday that a new round of economic sanctions on Iran are “done” and will be applied pending an announcement by the Department of the Treasury.  The sanctions – which come in addition to close to a thousand pieces of sanctions already applied since Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA or Iran nuclear deal) in 2018 – are Trump’s response to an Iranian missile strike on two military bases in Iraq on Wednesday. The Iranian attack was itself a response to the American assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Friday. READ MORE: The US unwittingly helped create Qassem Soleimani. Then they killed him The president also addressed the crash of the Ukrainian International Airlines plane which hit the ground shortly after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday killing 176 people on board. A preliminary Iranian report suggested that the Boeing 737-800 caught fire and tried to turn around before crashing while Ukrainian authorities are investigating whether a terrorist attack or “surface-to-air” missile brought down the airliner. Trump stopped short of accusing Tehran saying that he has “suspicions” that “somebody could have made a mistake.” Tehran has yet to hand over the plane’s black box and in the meantime the US media has reported anonymous US officials as saying the aircraft was“highly likely” brought down by Iranian air defenses. The Pentagon however is refusing to comment on the matter. The government in Tehran has said its ultimate goal is the removal of American troops from the Middle East. Trump too campaigned on bringing American forces home from foreign conflicts but in the wake of the latest standoff called for more NATO boots on the ground.

323,"The internet was at pains to process the news after Grimes posted a picture of what seems to be her baby bump with an image of a fetus photoshopped onto it. “Being knocked up is a very feral &amp; war-like state of being” she wrote in the Instagram post. The couple who have been dating since 2018 are generally seen as a fairly odd pairing. The idea of Grimes with her reputation as a counter-culture queen who has aired anti-capitalist views dating the multi-billionaire Tesla CEO has been a hard pill for her fans to swallow. Likewise Musk’s fans aren’t exactly enamored by her eccentric style and personality. Naturally the announcement that Grimes was possibly pregnant with “the spawn of Elon Musk” was going to produce some strong views. One person called the mere concept of Grimes being pregnant “the most uncomfortable thing I have ever experienced.” Some were worried the potential offspring would undoubtedly be “a pioneer in colonizing mars (sic).”  Another user was concerned that the baby — despite being born ""very rich"" — could be sacrificed in ""some weird AI blood ritual."" There were also plenty of alien jokes. Yet some weren't so sure that Grimes’ pregnancy announcement was even real at all suggesting that maybe she meant she was pregnant with her new album — or that it could all just be a ""publicity stunt.""

325,Scientifically it is impossible that a missile hit the Ukrainian plane and such rumours are illogical Ali Abedzadeh head of Iran's of Civil Aviation Organization said on Thursday according to the news agency ISNA. Citing anonymous Pentagon and intelligence officials US media have reported that the Boeing 737 was “highly likely” brought down by Iranian air defenses. The Ukrainian International Airlines flight 752 crashed within minutes of departing Tehran just hours after the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps fired two volleys of missiles at US targets inside Iraq as reprisal for last week’s assassination of General Qassem Soleimani. Even US President Donald Trump seemed to speculate about a missile in a speech on Thursday though he didn't blame the Iranian military but said that “somebody could have made a mistake.” Iranian civil aviation authorities considered the possibility that the plane was shot down but dismissed it because the plane attempted to return to the airport. Ukrainian officials cited a photo of missile debris that “was published on the internet” as possible evidence of an attack but Iranian authorities say the photos do not match physical evidence. “No parts of a missile were found at the scene of the crash” civil aviation inspector Hassan Rezaeifar told the IRNA news agency describing the missile scenario as “off the table.” A preliminary Iranian report suggested that the plane caught fire and tried to turn around before crashing.

326,Executives from the American taxi app unveiled the new features at a press event in New Delhi on Thursday. It said that users will be allowed to record their entire trip and may send it to the company if they are feeling uncomfortable. The feature will be in the testing phase in the country later this year. It also announced the introduction of a four-digit authentication code to ensure that passengers get in the correct car and promised to intervene when there is a long unplanned stop in a journey. This intervention dubbed Ride Check will come in the form of a phone call to both the driver and the passenger. However the feature relies on the driver’s smartphone to detect irregularities in the trip. Uber has been continually dogged by concerns over safety. Last month the company revealed that it received nearly 6000 reports of sexual assaults in the US in 2017 and 2018. The self-produced safety report also revealed 464 reports of rape in the two-year period.  Drivers reported sexual assaults at roughly the same rate as passengers though in 92 percent of the reported rapes the passenger was the victim.

327,"The social media behemoth has announced that it will continue to allow political ads to target users based on specific attributes (“microtargeting”) and exempt these ads from fact-checking two controversial practices that have been the subject of much pearl-clutching as the 2020 US presidential election approaches. While Facebook had briefly thought of limiting microtargeting it explained in a blog post on Thursday that talking with political campaigns NGOs and other groups that use the technique had convinced the company that it was necessary. Instead Facebook has opted for “expanded transparency” allowing users to learn about what ads are targeting them and why. A feature allowing the user to see fewer political ads will be introduced in the summer Facebook promised. Critics exploded. The Federal Election Commission’s Ellen Weintraub accused Facebook of “hurting democracy” and placing its profit margins above “protect[ing] the democracies that have nurtured its existence.” “These so-called ’transparency’ solutions are neither transparent nor solutions” she sniffed hinting that the platform’s intransigence might convince Congress to take away the Section 230 exemptions that allow it to avoid liability for content users post. Microtargeting Weintraub warned in the Washington Post recently “may be undermining the united character of our United States.” Others suggested Facebook was literally putting users’ lives at risk by allowing politicians to pay for the ability to lie to their constituents. Actor Sacha Baron Cohen who made waves when he declared last month that Adolf Hitler would have used Facebook to spread negative information about Jews called the move “outrageous” and slammed CEO Mark Zuckerberg for helping “the demagogues of the world.” The company - already blamed by some for the outcome of the 2016 election - was “actively destroying election integrity intentionally” all for the sake of its bottom line its detractors said. But not even Facebook believes voters should rely on the platform in place of their own critical thinking certainly not for something as important as choosing their leaders - at least so says Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth. “If we limit what information people have access to and what they can say then we have no democracy at all” he mused in a memo to Zuckerberg last month taking a surprisingly moral stance on informational coercion. Zuckerberg himself has said he does not want his platform to be viewed as an “arbiter of truth” with regard to political statements. Given that Facebook partnered with NATO-backed pro-war think tank Atlantic Council in 2018 and since then has been deplatforming dissident voices at a rapid clip many on mere suspicion of being linked to foreign ""manipulators"" the platform's users would be wise to take his words to heart.  Facebook’s laissez-faire approach to truth in advertising diverges wildly from the platform’s usual infantilization of its users whom it tends to treat more like human-shaped data-teats to be milked mercilessly than like intellectually curious critical thinkers. Yet this flicker of humanity in the soul of a corporation notorious for censoring “wrongthink” and promoting establishment-friendly content not the platform’s trading in private user data with third parties without consent or the frequent “breaches” that spill users’ information into the dark corners of the internet — is what the movers and shakers of American politics object to. For all that American politicians pay lip service to “media literacy” — House Democrats introduced a bill to promote critical thinking skills just a few months ago ostensibly to give citizens the tools to recognize disinformation — the explosive reaction to Facebook’s ad policy has shown it is more concerned with controlling the narrative than with encouraging voters to think for themselves. When Mark Zuckerberg is a society’s champion of free speech that society is in deep trouble. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

329,Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a truce in Libya during their meeting on Wednesday in Istanbul after Turkey sent troops and equipment to Tripoli in support of the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA).  Haftar’s LNA controls most of Libya however and has been advancing on Tripoli in recent days. He rejected the idea of a ceasefire on Thursday after returning from Rome where Italy tried without success to mediate a deal between the LNA and GNA head Fayez al-Sarraj. The general also declared jihad against Turkey last week after the parliament in Ankara voted to approve the troop deployment. The UN-backed government is only “hanging on in a coastal strip of the country” and has “very little control” over Libya political analyst Chris Bambery told RT. It is unlikely Haftar would agree to back down just when the LNA appears to be nearing victory he said. Italy which ruled Libya as a colonial power from 1911 into the 1940s tried to get Haftar and al-Sarraj to negotiate in Rome but the GNA leader canceled his trip after finding out the LNA general was also invited. Al-Sarraj went to Brussels instead for talks with EU officials which he called “very productive.” Once the most prosperous country in Africa Libya collapsed into chaos and civil war after a US-led NATO intervention in 2011 overthrew the government of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. Haftar’s LNA is one of the factions that emerged from the chaos with the backing of neighboring Egypt. Think your friends would be interested?

330,Video from outside the deceased financier’s cell on the day he was found semi-conscious on the floor with marks on his neck believed to have attempted suicide has been permanently deleted by Metropolitan Correctional Center according to a court filing. The jail allegedly saved video from the wrong tier of the facility. A backup system that should have retained the deleted footage stopped functioning in August and the video no longer exists there either due to “technical errors” prosecutors claimed. It is the latest in a long series of “mistakes” and anomalies surrounding the convicted sex offender’s death. The footage had a complicated journey before its final meeting with oblivion if media reports are to be believed. Prosecutors claimed to have “found” the video on December 19 a day after a prosecutor said it had gone missing during a hearing. When it was found it was said to have been properly preserved by MCC staff. The footage had been requested by attorneys for Epstein’s former cellmate a burly ex-cop named Nicholas Tartaglione accused of killing four people in a drug deal gone bad and burying them in his backyard.  They asked to see the tape in the hope of obtaining a more lenient sentence for Tartaglione after he claimed he had helped save Epstein’s life - only to be stonewalled for nearly five months.  Epstein allegedly attempted suicide on July 23 only to be saved by Tartaglione. Just two days later Tartaglione’s attorneys asked to see the surveillance footage only to be “told that it was not retained” one lawyer recalled to CNBC. It’s not clear why this went unremarked-upon for five months or where the footage was ultimately found.  Crucially it appears the footage was still in limbo when Epstein was found dead on the morning of August 10. His death was ruled a suicide though a celebrity pathologist hired by his family claimed his body showed evidence of homicidal strangulation and witnesses heard “shrieking and yelling” coming from his cell that morning. Epstein’s death - the first 'suicide' inside the MCC in decades - remains shrouded in mystery. Two guards have been charged with negligence for failing to check on their infamous prisoner for hours and surveillance video from that day was deemed “unusable.” Revelations that Epstein had compromising material on many of his powerful friends gave rise to numerous alternate theories about his death.

Alkhas Kvitsinia who lost to Khajimba by less than 2 percent in the second round argues that a new vote is needed as none of the candidates was able to pass the 50 percent threshold.

Trudeau’s claim follows statements from UK PM Boris Johnson that his government is “urgently looking into” reports that the plane was shot down by a missile and speculation from US President Donald Trump that he had “suspicions” that “somebody could have made a mistake.” While Trump did not explicitly accuse Tehran of shooting down the plane anonymous US officials have told media that it was “highly likely” Iranian air defenses brought it down.

Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran on its way to Kiev early Wednesday morning killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board. Ukraine has sent investigators to Tehran and an inquiry is underway into what caused the crash.

While it’s unclear when the image scans started Apple’s chief privacy officer Jane Horvath confirmed at an event in Las Vegas this week that the company is now “utilizing some technologies to help screen for child sexual abuse material.” Apple initially suggested it might inspect images for abuse material last year – and only this week added a disclaimer to its website acknowledging the practice – but Horvath’s remarks come as the first confirmation the company has gone ahead with the scans. A number of tech giants including Facebook Twitter and Google already employ an image-scanning tool known as PhotoDNA which cross-checks photos with a database of known abuse images. It is unknown whether Apple’s scanning tool uses similar technology. The move sent off alarms for critics some disputing Apple’s sincerity in its avowed desire to crack down on crime as well as whether the photo scans will further erode the privacy of consumers especially given the scant detail the company has so far offered about the screening process. “Of course everyone is for stopping child abuse and that’s not the issue here. It’s that I’m simply not buying it” journalist and political commentator Chadwick Moore told RT. “I don't believe that Apple really cares about fighting crime.” Moore said the company has been excessively vague about the scans noting “all it says is that they can scan all your images flip through all your data and look for potentially illegal activity including child pornography.” Tech expert and privacy advocate Bill Mew said the critics are wrong however arguing that the new measure may be less intrusive than it appears given Apple’s technological capabilities. “The technology that is in use is really clever” Mew told RT. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that Apple can actually see your photos” as the company can “sift through these images and test them against a set of known ‘fingerprints’ ... without actually de-encrypting the images themselves.” While Apple has gone to bat for data privacy in the past – on several occasions tussling with law enforcement agencies seeking access to one of the company’s devices – its track record on the question in somewhat mixed. In August it was revealed that company contractors were granted access to customers’ private conversations through Apple’s AI assistant program Siri in an effort to “grade” its performance. Several other tech giants have come under fire for similar intrusions with both Google and Amazon’s home assistant devices also found to surreptitiously record users. Like this story?

In its release of the redacted communications on Thursday following an internal probe Boeing acknowledged some of the messages were “completely unacceptable” and contained “provocative language.” In one missive sent in 2017 an employee castigated the 737 MAX – which was grounded globally last March after a series of fatal crashes – slamming both its designers and ‘supervisors’ apparently referring to federal regulators. The employee has not been named and it is not clear what problems he had identified with the MAX at the time. Another damning message sent in 2018 shows an employee grappling with ethical concerns telling a colleague “I still haven’t been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year” another apparent reference to the company’s interactions with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In addition to the faulty flight control system thought to have caused the two MAX crashes the aircraft’s flight simulators also came under fire by employees in the internal messages. “Would you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn’t” one employee asked a coworker who simply replied: “No.” In a statement issued along with the documents Boeing apologized “to the FAA Congress our airline customers and to the flying public” for the “content of these communications” adding it would pursue “disciplinary or other personnel action once the necessary reviews are completed.” An FAA spokesman however noted the documents do not reveal any new safety risks with the 737 MAX’s simulators despite the potentially incriminating communiques indicating employees concealed problems from the agency.

It is believed that the strike on Soleimani was carried out by an MQ-9 Reaper spy and combat UAV. Soleimani's death sparked a new flare-up between Iran and the US. Tehran retaliated in response to the assassination by launching missiles at military bases that house US troops in Iraq.

But we want to believe that these letters that came to life will also serve as a reminder of the price of victory” the project’s Creative Producer Kirill Karnovich-Valua explained. “We managed to put together a unique creative team of young artists designers illustrators composers and directors. Digital art is a modern and universal language that the youth speaks. Therefore we thought that on the 75th anniversary of the end of one of the worst wars it was important that we should try talk about the war’s legacy in the language of modern media.” Karnovich-Valua went on to say. The font was created by Contrast Foundry. Each letter has several alternate forms and sits in line somewhat unevenly creating a handwritten effect similar to the style of inscriptions on walls. A larger font size displays rich texture similar to something written on a rough surface while smaller lettering hardly shows any texture at all making it easier to read – this is possible due to a special algorithm that modifies the outline of the letters. The project comes from the team behind #1917LIVE and #Romanovs100 and will be rolled out primarily in Russian from January to May 2020. On Twitter #VictoryPages will relive the last months of the war in real time Instagram Stories will feature quotes from thousands of actual letters exchanged between the war front and home with illustrations by RANEPA students and a score from Maxim Makarychev (On-The-Go Sirotkin). A YouTube documentary series will tell the stories of soldiers and officers who made it to Berlin in 1945 and young graphic designers and digital artists will present their interpretation of the legacy of the Great Patriotic War using Facebook while producer Anna Fedorova will team up with musician Maxim Makarychev to create a series of Podcasts for VK.

337,If the Islamic Republic continues “with unraveling” the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on its nuclear program Tehran could obtain a nuclear weapon in the nearest future Le Drian told RTL radio on Friday. EU foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss ways of reducing the US-Iran tensions. Iran’s ambassador to the UN Majid Takht-Ravanchi reassured the public that this is not the case – even though the JCPOA is now in jeopardy. There is “no place for nuclear weapons in Iran’s defensive doctrine” he told PBS Newshour adding that his country is also abiding by the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty – a pact that strives for nuclear disarmament and provides for the setting of standards in arms control.

338,The trio of galaxies named EGS77 dates back to when the universe was just 680 million years old. In the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang the universe was a thick cloudy soup dense with hydrogen atoms and almost entirely bereft of light.  After 500 million years the epoch of deionization began in which ever-expanding galaxies began to burn away the fog splitting the hydrogen atoms into bubbles of plasma thus allowing light to travel across the cosmos. Think of ice melting on top of a lake in the spring as NASA so eloquently put it. This trio located some 13 billion light-years away is just now leaving the darkness encased by three overlapping bubbles of cosmic plasma which are only now deionizing their corner of the universe (clearing away the fog) and letting the light in (and out) thus ending the cosmic dark age.  “EGS77 is the first galaxy group caught in the act of clearing out this cosmic fog” study co-author James Rhoads of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center said. Astronomers think they’ve spotted these plasma bubbles expanding for the first time reshaping the universe around them and giving us an albeit distant glance into the cosmic past showcasing some of the earliest light ever observed.   “EGS77 has formed a large bubble that allows its light to travel to Earth” study co-author Vithal Tilvi a researcher at Arizona State University explained. “Eventually bubbles like these grew around all galaxies and filled intergalactic space reionizing the universe and clearing the way for light to travel across the cosmos.” Like this story?

339,"Kiev expects that it will be provided with all the data necessary to conduct an ""objective investigation"" Zelensky said on Friday. “The theory about missile hitting the plane is not ruled out but it's not confirmed as of today. Given the recent statements by countries' leaders to the media we urge all international partners – primarily the governments of the United States Canada and the UK – to provide data and evidence on this tragedy” Zelensky stated revealing that he will discuss the investigation with the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later in the day. The Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 crashed outside Iran's capital on Wednesday shortly after takeoff from Imam Khomeini airport. All 176 people on board were killed in the crash — the majority of the victims were Iranian and Canadian nationals. The incident occurred shortly after an Iranian missile attack on American bases in Iraq in response to the US assassination of Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani. The coincidence prompted allegations that the jet might have been downed by an anti-aircraft missile – and while no proof for that is available the claims have been backed by top politicians already. US President Donald Trump said that ""somebody could've made a mistake"" suggesting that Tehran was behind the crash. The US allies followed doubling down on the allegations – Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said he received ""intelligence"" from multiple sources that the jet was downed by an Iranian missile adding however that it might have been unintentional. Similar claim was produced by his UK counterpart Boris Johnson who said he possesses a ""body of information"" indicating the flight was shot down by the Iranians. Iran however has firmly denied the allegations of shooting down the aircraft. Iranian civil aviation authorities said that no missile debris had been found at the crash site and urged the US and Canada to release the data backing the missile hit claims.

Alpine sites have removed trees and other vegetation as well as using sprinklers to keep the ground wet in a bid to avoid the fate of the Selwyn Snow Resort just 50km (31 miles) from Threbdo which was burnt down several days ago. Meanwhile the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) warned that two large fires have merged into a 'mega-fire' burning more than 250000 hectares of land combined. The fires are ""just kilometers"" away from a third blaze raging in the Snowy Mountains and the Kosciuszko National Park the authorities said. Earlier reports indicated that the merger of devastating fires in New South Wales and the neighboring Victoria State could create a gigantic 600000-hectare blaze. More than 3300 firefighters have been deployed against the fire in New South Wales but the situation remains dangerous due to ""really erratic fire behavior"" the local RFS spokesperson said on Friday. The state's RFS community safety officer Marty Webster said that hot and windy weather conditions in the area were ""likely to deteriorate.""

345,Short footage of the recorders was released by Iranian media on Friday. The black boxes — that are actually bright orange — are seen sitting inside a crate handled by the officials with the Iranian Civil Aviation Organization (CAO). The flight data recorder appears to be largely intact yet it’s quite charred and has a handful of visible dents in its body. The cockpit voice recorder for its part appears to be missing most of its assembly — only the data storage itself is seen in the crate. Earlier head of the CAO Ali Abedzadeh revealed that the black boxes were damaged during the crash and the country might seek foreign help — from Russia Canada France or Ukraine in particular. Extracting data from the flight data and voice recorders is expected to take up to three months while the whole probe will take up to two years. The black boxes are expected to be “opened” on Friday Iranian media reported. The crash — that killed 176 people primarily Canadian and Iranian nationals — occurred outside Iran’s capital on Wednesday. Shortly after the incident western media — followed by top politicians citing “intelligence data” — alleged that the aircraft might have been downed by an Iranian surface-to air-missile.

347,Robinson –real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon– appeared on Ross Kemp’s ITV series ‘Welcome to HMP Belmarsh’ on Thursday night. The documentary gives viewers an insight into one of Britain’s most dangerous prisons where Robinson was an inmate for nine weeks last year before being released in September.  During one moment Kemp’s questions reduced Robinson to tears as he struggled to convey how being in solitary confinement had affected him.  Asked how he was feeling Robinson fought back tears responding: “I’d say that my thing is ‘cause I know I’m going home to my kids and you just wanna be normal.” The 37-year-old is then seen walking away from the camera before adding: “Yeah that’s embarrassing.” However the controversial figure does manage to open up more about life inside Belmarsh insisting: “I know what 10 weeks of solitary confinement does.” The claim was ruthlessly slapped down by Kemp. Robinson was found guilty of contempt over his filming of criminal defendants outside a court and broadcasting the footage online. He was originally sentenced to nine months but was told in July 2019 that he would only serve 10 weeks in prison due to time already served for the same offense. Fellow Belmarsh prisoner Liridon Saliuka 29 was found dead in his cell on January 2 following a dispute over whether he should have been classified as disabled. He was the third inmate to have died in the jail – which is also where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is being held – in less than a year.

Greminger said that ""concerns"" about media freedom have been conveyed to Estonia and Desir had asked local authorities to provide more information about the case. On Thursday tensions surrounding Sputnik Estonia were officially listed among the 'media freedom alerts' on the Council of Europe's website. The case was registered under the 'other acts having chilling effects on media freedom' category. Estonian police have been sending letters to journalists working for Sputnik's bureau in the nation's capital Tallinn in which they threatened them with ""criminal liability"" unless they cut all work ties with Russian state-owned media agency Rossiya Segodnya Sputnik's parent company. The officials insisted that this was completely lawful since the head of Rossiya Segodnya veteran journalist and media producer Dmitry Kiselyov has been sanctioned by the EU since Crimea voted to leave Ukraine and rejoin Russia. Rossiya Segodnya slammed the actions of Estonian police as a ""flagrant violation of the freedom of speech"" and said that Sputnik's employees in Estonia had been pressured into terminating their employment contracts with the agency.

349,The bizarre incident with the aircraft operated by Russian carrier Nordwind occurred on Friday afternoon. The pilots requested an emergency landing over smoke that began to appear in the cabin according to media reports. The landing turned out to be rough as the plane apparently hit the tarmac with its front way too hard. Photos from the scene show its airframe badly bent around the front landing gear — which penetrated the plane’s structure entering the cabin a little. Both of the gear’s tires have been ruptured during the landing yet the strut itself was able to survive the hit and remained standing. The incident has been acknowledged by Russia’s Consulate General in Antalya. The plane was not carrying passengers and nobody was injured among the crew the diplomatic mission said.

350,An international research team has discovered unexpectedly large amounts of water vapor accumulating at an altitude of 80km up in the Martian atmosphere.  The scientists gathered the data thanks to the Trace Gas Orbiter probe from the ExoMars mission which is financed by the Russian space agency Roscosmos and the European Space Agency. Previous studies had already established that water vapor escapes the Martian atmosphere via violent dust storms. The gigantic dust tornadoes act as a kind of space elevator transporting the H2O far enough up that sunlight breaks up the molecules into their constituent parts forming a vast cloud of hydrogen in the process. However boffins have now found pockets in the atmosphere containing 10 to 100 times more water vapor than should theoretically be possible given the temperature in a phenomenon known as “supersaturation.”  The extraordinary levels of supersaturation “are observed nowhere on any other body of the solar system” Franck Montmessin a planetary scientist at the University of Paris-Saclay and the study’s co-lead author explained.   While most of the Red Planet's remaining water is now trapped in the polar ice caps given the planet’s relatively weak gravity (40 percent as strong as Earth's) the loss of water vapor at such an unprecedented rate throws a spanner in the works of any future plans for colonization or even terraforming until the mystery can be solved once and for all.

351,The team wanted to investigate if increasing the number of stem cells in the brain would help in recovering cognitive functions like learning and memory that had worsened or had been lost entirely during the aging process.  To do so researchers from TU Dresden’s Center for Regenerative Therapies used a method to stimulate and increase the number of neural stem cells located in the brains of mice and thus increase the number of neurons they generate.  Much to their surprise the newly generated neurons survived and formed new contacts in neighboring brain cells. To put these freshly minted neurons to the test the boffins then tested the navigational abilities of the test subject mice.  Mice and humans develop strategies for navigation in much the same way: when both species are young our brains build and remember cognitive maps of an environment. As we age however this ability fades significantly. Older mammalian brains must instead learn the list of detailed navigational steps to reach a target destination within an environment with little to no access to the overall cognitive map. This means that should the starting point change in the same environment it would take far longer to navigate to the end destination.  By stimulating the neural stem cells in their brains the old mice in the study successfully recovered their cognitive mapping ability and remembered the layout of a given environment for far longer effectively reversing the effects of the aging process on this particular skill.  “Age-related impairments can be rescued by hijacking the endogenous neurogenic potential of the brain thus rejuvenating its function” explained Professor Federico Calegari senior author of the study. The researchers took it one step further and carried out the same neural stem cell stimulation treatment on the brains of young mice and found that cognitive impairments were delayed and memory was preserved for longer over the course of their lives.  A part of the brain known as the hippocampus is crucial for remembering places and events but this degrades over time and as a result older brains use other structures that are more closely associated with habit-forming. The researchers now believe they can delay this switch and thus improve overall cognition throughout an animal’s lifespan though this treatment is of course some time away from human trials.  Think your friends would be interested?

354,The office of the Prosecutor General in Kiev has urged that everyone “refrain from speculations” concerning the plane crash. The prosecutors stopped short of mentioning anyone by name but the statement was likely a rebuke of Yuriy Lutsenko who despite lacking a law degree had served as the nation’s prosecutor-general for three years until he was dismissed last August. Lutsenko had earlier accused the prosecution of “burying its head in the sand” by treating the plane crash as an air traffic rules violation case rather than a terrorist act. Kiev-bound Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran airport on Wednesday killing all 176 people on board. The tragedy occurred on the same day as Iran fired a volley of ballistic missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house US troops. The action was a response to the US drone strike that killed top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani along with several other Iranian and Iraqi officials at Baghdad Airport. This close sequence of events immediately sparked a flurry of speculation in the media as to whether Iran’s army could have shot the airliner by mistake. US president Donald Trump Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and their British counterpart Boris Johnson have all suggested that that could have been the case. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky asked foreign partners to share their data which could help the investigation. The Prosecutor General’s office confirmed on Friday that it had requested assistance from foreign governments. Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko who is meeting his American counterpart Mike Pompeo on Friday tweeted that US diplomats have provided Ukraine with “important data that will be examined by our experts.” Iran firmly denies the airliner was downed by a missile and says that it likely crashed due to some equipment failure or other issues on board.

His remarks were delivered by Iran's UN Ambassador Majid Takht-Ravanchi after Washington refused to issue a visa for Zarif to attend the meeting himself — a violation of its obligations as the host of the UN headquarters.

358,UK police say Gemma Watts may have assaulted up to 50 school girls while posing as a 16-year-old school boy named ‘Jake Watton.’ Officers said many of her victims may only realise they had been duped by the predator now that she has been jailed and her case widely publicised. The 21-year-old groomed her victims via Snapchat Instagram Whatsapp and other social media services. She tied her hair up and wore a baseball cap baggy trousers and a hoodie to fool the children.  Watts began what the judge described as her “predatory behavior” when she was 19 and targeted a number of 13 to 16 year olds. She convinced the children to swap intimate photos sometimes speaking with them over the phone before travelling by train to meet in person. She reportedly even met some of the girls’ parents while in character as ‘Jake.’ One of the victims said that her ‘heart exploded’ in an impact statement which was read aloud to Winchester Crown Court. “My world stopped I actually stopped breathing… I loved him so much” the victim wrote. Watts previously pleaded guilty to seven charges of sexual assault and grooming of four girls between the ages of 14 and 15. However she continued to groom young females whilst on police bail after her initial arrest and partial confession and was later placed under surveillance to prevent her from offending again while investigations were ongoing. “The level of manipulation and deceit used by Watts to snare her victims in this case was truly shocking” Police Constable Nicola Benson from Hampshire Constabulary said.  “Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation online with increased use of social media apps and there is a real risk that any contact with a stranger online can lead to a child meeting an offender in person” she added. On Friday Watts was sentenced to eight years in prison was placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life and was made subject to a life-long Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

361,"In a statement on Friday department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said that the US military presence in Iraq was ‘appropriate’ and that any delegation the US might send to Iraq to discuss arrangements between the two countries would not discuss the removal of troops. Ortagus acknowledged that there does “need to be a conversation” between US and Iraqi officials “not just regarding security but about our financial economic and diplomatic partnership.” Earlier Friday Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi had asked US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to send a delegation to begin preparations for a troop pullout. The Iraqi parliament last week passed a non-binding resolution asking the government to expel foreign troops and to cancel the ongoing request for military assistance from the US-led coalition.  There are currently 5200 US troops stationed at bases across Iraq who were invited by the Iraqi government in 2014 to help combat ISIS militants in the region. The relationship between Washington and Baghdad has soured in recent months however as tensions in the region flared. The mood got even more tense after a US drone strike in Baghdad killed a commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force. Iraq’s parliamentary resolution was dismissed by US President Donald Trump who threatened the country with ""very big sanctions"" and said the US would not leave until Iraq paid Washington back for an expensive air base it had built there. Pompeo has also disregarded the will of the Iraqi parliament saying he was ""confident"" that the Iraqi people want US troops to remain. Saad Al-Muttalibi a member of the Baghdad Security Committee told RT last week that it was ""very important"" for the US to withdraw its troops from Iraq because Iraqis “don't want to be drawn into a war between Iran and America on Iraqi soil.” Think your friends would be interested?

362,"Torreon mayor Jorge Zermeno said the boy turned the gun on himself after shooting his teachers and classmates leaving two people dead. The Attorney General of Coahuila Gerardo Marquez told reporters that the child had left the class to use the restroom where he apparently changed clothes into an outfit that included a t-shirt bearing the words 'Natural Selection.' A similar shirt was donned by Columbine student Eric Harris when he and fellow twelfth-grader Dylan Klebold shot 13 people dead at their school in 1999. When the 11-year-old failed to return to class after 15 minutes the teacher went looking for him and the boy opened fire using two handguns Marquez added. Footage from outside the Colegio Cervantes school shows anxious parents and children gathered around. The school was evacuated after the alarm was raised when shots were fired shortly before 9am local time. Local media initially reported 3 dead but the number was later lowered to two with six others reportedly admitted to hospital. The injured who reportedly include one adult and a girl as young as seven are being treated at the Sanatorio Espanol hospital. A police investigation is underway to establish the motive for the attack.""We are already investigating but not even the boy's father knows how he had access to the weapon"" Coahuila State Attorney delegate Maurilio Ochoa told the media.

363,“We have no reason to not believe the reports we have seen from different NATO allies…that the plane may have been downed by Iranian air defense systems” Stoltenberg told reporters on Friday. He called for Iran to “participate and contribute to a transparent and thorough investigation.” Iran has welcomed countries that lost citizens in the crash of Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 which killed all 176 people on board to participate in the investigation. It has suggested it will enlist the help of France or Canada in decoding the data from the black boxes retrieved from the wreckage but refuses to hand them over to the US. The US-led narrative that Iran shot down the plane by “mistake” has gradually eclipsed other explanations in the media even from outlets that had previously aired competing narratives though no evidence has emerged to support the hypothesis. US President Donald Trump hinted on Thursday that “somebody could have made a mistake” and anonymous US officials went further to claim it was “highly likely” Iran had shot it down. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau piled on with his own claims that multiple pieces of intelligence supported the narrative though he admitted it was too early to be “drawing any conclusions.” Iran has called the claims “psychological warfare” and asked the US and its allies to produce evidence to support the rapidly-congealing narrative. Ukrainian prosecutors have meanwhile called for an end to “speculations” and the “shameless self-promotion” of certain politicians that are trying to capitalize on the narrative. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed to foreign partners to share the evidence mentioned in the public claims. The plane crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini Airport en route to Kiev not long after Iran had fired missiles at two US bases in Iraq. Aside from temporal proximity however no evidence has yet emerged implicating Iran in the flight’s demise. Like this story?

364,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday announced a new round of sanctions against Iran which he said would be aimed at stopping Tehran’s “global terrorist activities.” The new restrictions would affect Iran’s construction textiles mining steel and iron industries among others. The sanctions will also target eight senior Iranian officials whom Washington accuses of being involved in the latest missile attacks. Mike Pompeo in turn described the newly-sanctioned officials as members of Iran’s “inner security apparatus.” Among those sanctioned are the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council and the deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian armed forces. A leader of a paramilitary group within the Revolutionary Guard’s Corps that acts as law enforcement and social services provider in Iran was also slapped with restrictions. Washington also subjected 17 major Iranian metal manufacturers and mining companies to sanctions and imposed restrictions against several China- and Seychelles-based enterprises which it described as major ""purchasers and transporters"" of Iranian steel as well as providers of critical materials for the relevant Iranian industries. The Secretary of State also said that he has ""no doubt"" Iran had ""full intention"" to kill Americans in its latest missile strike on Iraqi bases housing the US troops. He also added that the US believes that Iran was ""likely"" to jave shot down the Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed after taking off from Tehran airport as well. Pompeo went on to call Trump's response to Tehran's actions ""appropriate"" adding that the US ""does not want war."" Instead he said Washington would ""continue its strategic effort"" to force Iran to abandon what he called a ""40-year-long"" campaign to ""terrorize the world."" The announcement comes a day after President Donald Trump promised more sanctions against Iran following the missile attack targeting the US troops in Iraq. The newly announced restrictions would come in addition to a thousand pieces of earlier constraints Washington relentlessly imposed against Tehran ever since Trump unilaterally left the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018. The tensions between the two nations have been high for more than a year and a half but saw a dramatic escalation after the US assassinated a top Iranian general in a drone strike in early January. The Iranian attack on the US bases in Iraq was a response to this strike. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!  ", https://www.rt.com/news/477960-us-sanctions-iran-pompeo/,None
365,Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko asked that the media not spread “unconfirmed” information on Friday pleading with reporters to “reduce the level of speculation” while the probe continues. The experts are still analyzing evidence looking at the bodies of the victims and the wreckage in hope of gaining insight into what took down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 killing all 176 people on board. Kiev has not ruled out any explanation for the flight’s demise Prystaiko said adding that Iran has been cooperative and that the investigative team has accessed the black boxes retrieved from the wreckage. He said the Ukrainian team could not confirm the photos purporting to show bulldozers working at the crash site. Prystaiko also denied that either the US or Iran were pressuring Kiev in regard to the investigation. Ukraine will seek compensation for the victims if the crash is determined to be deliberate he said. There is no evidence yet that the plane fell victim to a terrorist attack the foreign minister said. He confirmed it had turned around after “something happened” but did not put forth any possibilities as to why. Think your friends would be interested?

366,"“The balance of power is shifting internationally” Kurz told lawmakers as he presented his new government formed after his conservative People’s Party struck a coalition deal with the Greens. The chancellor admitted that America’s global dominance is continuously being challenged by other resurgent powers like China. Ties with Russia Austria's ""largest neighbor to the east"" have been also stirred up.  Yet Europe which is still tightly aligned with its partner across the pond would hardly win anything in this situation if its relations with America’s rivals stay the same he noted. Speaking of Europe’s position on the global stage Kurz said that despite being “unbelievably successful” the EU still lacks courage to act decisively and independently with regards to international relations.When it comes to these international issues the European Union is sometimes “weak and not fully capable of acting” he said. The Austrian chancellor’s statements came less than a day after the US President Donald Trump once again claimed that his country “defends” Europe against Russia while also lambasting the European nations for their alleged reluctance to pay their NATO bills. In fact relations between the US and its allies in Europe have been sour for some time. Washington has been attempting to force Europe to back away from the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project with “extremely pro-European” sanctions sparking resentment in Berlin in particular. Washington’s unilateral withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal and aggressive policy towards Tehran also did not sit well with the Europeans who desperately sought to keep the agreement although with little success.The assassination of Iran’s top general did not make relations between the US and Europe any easier. The US strike which almost pushed the two nations to the brink of war prompted the European leaders to call for calm and restraint as well as to try and distance themselves from the potential conflict.The stance was met with an angry reaction in Washington. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that “the Europeans haven’t been as helpful as I wish that they could be” while stating that they “need to understand” that Washington acted in their interests as well.

367,Celebrities like Jane Fonda and Joaquin Phoenix headlined the protest which was part of the Friday Fire Drills originally inspired by teen climate change activist Greta Thunberg.  “Fire drill Fridays call for fast action on the Green New Deal and an end to all fossil fuel exploration extraction and taxpayer subsidies to oil companies” a notice for the protest read. 'Joker' star Phoenix as well as Martin Sheen Susan Sarandon and Fonda — who has been arrested multiple times while protesting — attended and spoke at the rally.  During brief remarks in front of the crowd Phoenix preached about the meat and dairy industries being the “third leading cause of climate change.” The famous vegan encouraged people to make better choices about what they consume. He ended his remarks by admitting he had flown on an airplane to the protest.  The celebs also joined the march and held placards. Various other speakers railed against the “patriarchy” and “colonialism” and preached: “We are the woke.”  Phoenix previously earned criticism for bragging about wearing one tuxedo to every awards ceremony most of which he is attending for recognition of his performance in ‘Joker.’ The activism did not earn much praise. “My husband and his co-workers wear the same firefighter outfit when they go into burning buildings to try to save people. But yeah good for you Joaquin” one Twitter user wrote. The thought was retweeted by former Fox News host Megyn Kelly. “How out of touch are these ppl?? Oh the sacrifice! Just ONE tuxedo! Spare us” Kelly commented. The political preaching clearly did not follow the advice of Golden Globes host and comedian Ricky Gervais who told a Hollywood crowd which included Phoenix last week to avoid political preaching because they “know nothing about the real world.” At Friday's protest Phoenix ended up following in Fonda's footsteps and being one of many arrested by police after not following orders to cooperate and disperse.  Like this story?

368,In a statement posted to her website on Friday Williamson said she had run for president to “forge another direction” for the country and to bring topics to the agenda which otherwise would not be discussed. The 67-year-old self-help guru and proponent of a more “mindful politics” was polling at around one percent support and had not qualified for the next Democratic debate – but said she stayed in the race to take advantage of every opportunity to share her message. With a crowded Democratic field of candidates Williamson said she recognized that the upcoming presidential primaries might be tightly-contested and she did not want to “get in the way of a progressive candidate” winning any of them. Earlier this month she had laid off her campaign staff but said she would continue running without them. She was often mocked for what many saw as her eccentric ideas including advocating the formation of a US ‘Department of Peace.’ Williamson raised some eyebrows during a July debate when she said US President Donald Trump had harnessed the “dark psychic force of collectivized hatred.” During her campaign she also released plans on “racial reconciliation and healing” and was a strong supporter of reparations for slavery explaining that on an “emotional psychological and spiritual” level the country couldn’t afford not to pay them.  “A politics of conscience is still yet possible. And yes….love will prevail” Williamson wrote at the end of her statement on Friday. Williamson was also unsuccessful in her 2014 campaign for California's 33rd congressional district seat.

369,As Biden once the solid favorite in Democrat primary polls continues to tank the usual suspects are emerging to pin his fall from grace on the Kremlin and not Biden’s own mouth problematic family members or uninspiring policies. The former vice president’s once-certain status as the establishment favorite for the nomination has faded with even CNN taking shots at him recently after he lied about his early and enthusiastic support for the Iraq war. Institutional Russophobes would have voters believe their growing disillusionment with the moderate centrist was implanted by Kremlin propaganda however.  “US intelligence and law enforcement officials” are already probing whether Biden is the target of a Russian “disinformation” campaign according to two anonymous officials who spoke to Bloomberg on Friday.  Putting aside the insult implicit in telling voters who dislike Biden that their opinions are not their own the claim – unsupported by evidence in the manner of most 'Russian meddling' allegations – suggests that Democrats are already bracing for the loss of the 2020 election and rushing to get the narrative scaffolding in place to explain away a second Trump victory.  Even after the “Russia hacked the 2016 election” narrative fell apart with the ignominious “no further indictments” conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation boomeranging into an Inspector General inquiry and a criminal probe of the FBI malfeasance that kicked off the whole affair the American political elite don’t seem to be able to resist the temptation to blame Russia yet again. Bloomberg’s breathless report blames Russia for promoting Biden’s own Ukrainian scandal while Trump was being impeached over allegedly withholding military aid to pressure Kiev into restarting a probe of the natural gas firm where Biden’s son was a director. The case against Trump was shaky from the start and only Democrats’ white-hot hatred for the president pushed it to the level of an impeachable offense.  Yet the much more solid quid-pro-quo case against Biden – who publicly bragged about bullying Ukraine into firing its chief prosecutor by withholding $1 billion in IMF loan guarantees – went largely ignored in the US media except for conservative outlets. This is hardly “disinformation” unless Bloomberg is using the Newspeak definition floated in a recent academic paper that includes “truths arranged to serve a particular purpose.”  It is simply assumed Russia would want Trump to be president for four more years even though he scrapped arms treaties and piled more sanctions on the country and nearly led the US into a catastrophic war with Iran. Nevertheless former FBI agent Clint Watts – one of the minds behind the notorious Hamilton 68 “Russian bot” dashboard – nevertheless insists “a second term of Trump would be great” for Moscow. National Counterintelligence and Security Center director William Evanina warns Russian “influence campaigns” will only grow commandeering “new vectors of disinformation” to hoodwink the American public. Biden has repeatedly bragged “Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be president” accusing the Russian president of sending an “army of bots” after him. Like Hillary Clinton before him Biden has focused more on demonizing Trump than touting his own record possibly because his service in an administration that turned two wars into seven left Libya a failed state and allowed a huge amount of wealth to “trickle up” from the working class to the rich diverges wildly from even the tepidly pro-middle class pro-peace positions outlined on his campaign website. Even when he’s not making what the media has decided to politely call “gaffes” bursting blood vessels in his eye on live TV or sniffing little girls’ hair Biden offers little more than reheated Obama-era policies without Barack Obama’s smooth stage presence. Evidence shows it is the Democratic Party’s insistence on embracing middle-of-the-road candidates ideologically indistinguishable from most Republicans – not “Russian disinformation” – that is hurting them at the polls. Pinning Biden’s failure on Russia however has repercussions that reach much further than just a single candidate’s campaign or a single election. With the first primaries rapidly approaching intelligence agencies are pushing the “election meddling” story hard hoping to make lemonade out of the lemon that a second Trump victory would be.  Not only Russia but China and Iran will “seek to interfere in the voting process or influence voter perceptions” a joint statement from seven agencies in November warned. Literally anything could be construed as “influencing voter perceptions” and that’s the point: to retroactively paint perfectly innocent reporting as agitprop. This paves the way for a major crackdown on alt-media and other forms of dissent – one that has arguably alreadybegun.

370,The US Naval Forces Central Command on Friday accused a “Russian Navy ship” of provoking a near-collision with the US Navy destroyer USS Farragut in the North Arabian Sea. In a statement that was promptly picked up by many western outlets the US Navy said that the Russian vessel had “aggressively approached” the American destroyer during the incident on Thursday. It claimed the Russian ship ignored its warnings about a potential collision before ultimately altering its course. “While the Russian ship took action the initial delay in complying with international rules while it was making an aggressive approach increased the risk of collision.” Russia’s Ministry of Defence responded by calling the US claim “not consistent with reality.” It further explained that it was in fact the USS Farragut that crossed the path of the Russian ship in violation of international maritime regulations and called the American crew’s actions “unprofessional.” The ministry also said that the two videos shot by the Americans actually prove that the Russian vessel had the right of way. One of them shows the Russian ship sailing to the right of the US destroyer without making any dangerous maneuvers. The two ships can be seen gradually coming closer to each other however. The second video shows the Russian ship sailing closely behind the USS Farragut before it turns away to seemingly avoid a potential collision. The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea – a 1972 convention regulating the rules of navigation in the open sea – states that “the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall if the circumstances of the case admit avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.” If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/news/477976-us-russian-ships-aggressive-approach/,None
371,“I have asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to be prepared to bring to the Floor next week a resolution to appoint managers and transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate” Pelosi (D-California) wrote in a letter to House Democrats on Friday. “Pelosi caves” declared Senator Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) who authored the motion to change the Senate rules so the charges could be dismissed if the House continued to withhold them. Having rushed to impeach Trump on December 18 arguing he posed a “clear and present danger” to US national security and the very fabric of democracy Democrats proceeded to sit on the articles for over three weeks. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) sought to use them as leverage to force the Senate Republican leadership to accept their terms for the trial. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) rebuffed all of their requests and eventually signed up to Hawley’s proposal. Pelosi and Schumer claimed there was “new evidence” that could come to light during the Senate trial pointing to a statement by former national security adviser John Bolton that he would be willing to testify if asked. McConnell countered that the rules for the impeachment trial were set in 1999 for President Bill Clinton and that he had no intention of changing them.  Republicans pointed to the delays as proof the Democrats were not serious and that the entire process was a partisan attempt to overturn the 2016 election. No Republicans voted in favor of the articles of impeachment while at least one Democrat dissented on one or both of them. They also pointed to Pelosi holding a vote to approve the trade deal with Mexico and Canada a day after the impeachment and inviting Trump to deliver the annual State of the Union address on February 4 as if nothing had happened. Pelosi did not get “a single one of her absurd demands because her own party got fed up with her games” said House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana). The speaker denied there was any dissent in her party however telling reporters on Friday that she had “absolutely total cooperation” from fellow Democrats.  “We have 1000 flowers blossoming beautifully in our caucus” she added using the phrase commonly attributed to Chinese leader Mao Zedong during a short-lived campaign to promote dissent within the Communist party in 1957.

372,Martin Scorsese’s ‘The Irishman’ may be an awards favorite at the moment but a spotlight was just blasted onto one of the movie’s most glaring flaws: the de-aging of its star cast. Robert De Niro Joe Pesci Al Pacino and others are de-aged throughout the film which tells a story that spans three decades. Even positive reviews of the Netflix feature which debuted in November pointed out that the de-aging CGI effects were lacking in the believability department. Now YouTube user iFake a deepfake video specialist has released their own video de-aging the actors with free technology and then comparing the results to those of Netflix which reportedly spent well over $100 million on the Martin Scorsese-directed feature.  The video reportedly took only seven days to make (it’s only a few minutes long) and the results show the characters in the actual Netflix movie to be a bit too rough around the edges and unfinished.  Though many Hollywood insiders are likely hesitant to criticize Scorsese and company in the middle of awards season this new video is already earning fans. ‘The Grey’ and ‘Narc’ director Joe Carnahan took to Twitter to praise the video and throw some shade at the effects in Scorsese’s effort. “All I can say about this is HOLY S**T” the director tweeted. After one user responded by saying iFake was at an advantage since they were de-aging the already de-aged footage from the film Carnahan doubled down on his criticisms. “Then that's what they should have been doing. Results is results guys. We can say it's 2k and wouldn't hold up yadda-yadda but the stuff on the right looks better than the stuff on the left” he wrote.  Some critics have begun turning on Scorsese’s vision as well. “It’s enough to make you wonder whether outspoken big-screen advocate Scorsese spent all that money in an effort to try to bankrupt Netflix from the inside” Joe Berkowitz wrote for Fast Company about the new video just one of many critics to praise the effects of the deepfake video of Scorsese’s film.

373,Cybersecurity was nonexistent in Microsoft’s audio transcription and rating program according to a former contractor who spoke to the Guardian on Friday. The company sent contractors a username and password in plaintext unencrypted email using the same password for everyone who joined in a given year. They also neglected to vet workers the ex-contractor said adding that they merely took his bank account details when he was hired.  Other than the popular VoIP and messaging service the Cortana voice assistant is also claimed to have been affected. Theoretically any contractor could access the account of any other allowing one “bad apple” to wreak immense havoc on the system while covering their tracks.Nor were there any security measures in place to protect the recordings contractors listened to the ex-employee said.  These were accessed over the open internet in China where the companies Microsoft outsourced to were located. This the report emphasizes means users’ data could be pilfered or otherwise misused not only by a rogue contractor but also by the Chinese government.  What it does not mention is that the American government has had access to Microsoft users’ data at least since the company became the first tech firm to join the NSA’s PRISM program in 2007 or that Microsoft actually helped the NSA penetrate its encryption. While it’s now common (if controversial) knowledge that AI voice assistants like Cortana Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa have human “helpers” rating their performance by listening to snippets of recordings Microsoft extended the practice to Skype calls that used its real-time AI translation feature. The company admitted in its privacy policy that it would “analyze audio” of calls but it did not spell out the possibility of un-vetted contractors halfway around the world accessing that audio over insecure internet connections - often in the comfort of their own homes according to the former contractor who claims to have heard “all kinds of unusual conversations including what could have been domestic violence.” Cortana is often triggered accidentally meaning some recordings are made without the user’s knowledge. Like Apple and Google before it Microsoft now claims it has ended its human grading program for Skype and Cortana for Xbox. The remaining audio reviewers have been relocated to “secure facilities” which Microsoft was careful to point out are not located in China. “We review short snippets of de-identified voice data from a small percentage of customers to help improve voice-enabled features” Microsoft said in a statement in defense of its practices acknowledging that “we sometimes engage partner companies in this work.” The snippets it maintained are “typically fewer than ten seconds long” and not linked to longer conversations. The massive security lapse doesn’t speak well of Microsoft’s security software particularly the Pentagon-backed “ElectionGuard” that will supposedly be guarding Americans’ votes from malicious interference in November.

374,The man had no known address and was detained on the Flagler Memorial Bridge on Friday morning. He had “several knives” and an undisclosed amount of cash on him according to WPTV. Other local outlets claimed the man’s arsenal included a machete two knives a pick axe and $22000 in cash and that a bomb squad was searching his vehicle found at the Palm Beach International Airport. The now-deleted photos by a WPEC-TV reporter showed a Saturn getting towed away from the parking garage with ‘I’m Germany’ [sic] written on the back window. The arrest comes just days after Iran fired missiles at two US bases in Iraq in revenge for the US drone attack that killed Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps General Qassem Soleimani at the Baghdad international airport. There were no casualties in Iran's strikes and both Trump and the Islamic Republic chose not to escalate the situation any further. There were multiple reports in Western media that Iran had offered an $80 million bounty for the killing of Trump but those reports were based on comments made by an unidentified mourner at Soleimani’s funeral rather than an actual government announcement.   The bridge where the suspect was arrested is less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) north of Mar-a-Lago the resort Trump favors on the weekends and holidays. Federal officials were involved in the investigation according to WPBF-TV. Mar-a-Lago has been a popular destination for tourists hoping to get a glimpse of the US president. In two instances so far Chinese tourists that made their way to the private club grounds have been detained by the authorities. A 56-year-old woman was arrested for trespassing on December 18 while a 33-year-old pleaded guilty to an earlier trespassing incident in April. Like this story?

375,Home Secretary Priti Patel filed a formal extradition request on Friday for Anne Sacoolas who struck 19-year-old Harry Dunn with her car last August while driving on the wrong side of the road near a joint US-UK military base in Northamptonshire. Dunn who was riding a motorbike did not survive. “The Home Office has sent an extradition request to the United States for Anne Sacoolas on charges of causing death by dangerous driving” the Home Office said in a statement. “This is now a decision for the US authorities.” The authorities in question wasted little time in voicing disapproval to the request with the US State Department calling it “highly inappropriate” and stating that it would “establish an extraordinarily troubling precedent.” Soon after the crash Sacoolas was granted diplomatic immunity and allowed to leave the country but some UK officials have questioned the move with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab opening a probe into the matter last Fall arguing the immunity rules in place were not “right.” While British prosecutors charged Sacoolas for reckless driving in December she has so far refused to “return voluntarily” to face the music with Sacoolas’ lawyer saying she would not risk jail time in the UK for a “terrible but unintentional accident.” The US State Department meanwhile said it was “disappointed” by the decision to bring charges insisting Sacoolas’ diplomatic status should insulate her from all legal consequences. Some netizens couldn’t help but draw comparisons between Sacoolas’ case and that of WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange who currently awaits proceedings for extradition to the US in a maximum security UK prison over his role in publishing classified material. Sacoolas’ treatment at the hands of the authorities of both countries sits in stark contrast to Assange’s however who has been deprived of a proper legal defense and health care. Like this story?

376,The FAA said Boeing had “failed to adequately oversee its suppliers to ensure they complied with the company's quality assurance system” in a statement on Friday adding that it had “knowingly submitted aircraft for final FAA airworthiness certification after determining that the parts could not be used due to a failed strength test.” The aviation regulator announced in June that over 300 Boeing aircraft might contain faulty components which could injure passengers or prevent planes from landing safely and said it would require the company to replace the parts. While the company has taken a serious hit in quarterly earnings over the last year after a series of fatal crashes involving the 737 MAX – which has been grounded worldwide since last March – each year Boeing counts its profits in the billions making the proposed fine a barely perceptible slap on the wrist. Boeing’s recently ousted CEO Dennis Muilenburg who was fired in December as the company struggled in the aftermath of the MAX crashes was given $62 million in benefits as he departed the firm – a sum dwarfing the FAA’s latest fine. He was slated to receive a “severance” package and stocks worth millions more but forfeited the offer. Like this story?

377,Located along the highly strategic Strait of Hormuz which it shares with Iran Oman under Qaboos maintained better relations with the Islamic Republic than any other Gulf nation. Throughout his tenure on the throne the sultan also played a role in mediating dialogue between American and Iranian leaders often serving as a go-between for the two sides. Just last December Omani delegations met with top diplomats in both Tehran and Washington in the space of a week encouraging Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to urge for a reduction in tensions across the Persian Gulf. Oman was the only member of the Gulf Cooperation Council to refrain in 2015 from joining the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen. In November the country brokered 'indirect' talks between Saudi Arabia and Yemen’s Houthi rebel movement looking to resolve the five-year conflict that’s produced one of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. On that front too Oman has offered a hand providing desperately needed aid to Yemenis.Qaboos has ruled the Gulf Arab state since 1970 when he led the bloodless overthrow of Sultan Said bin Taimur – his father – with backing from Britain formerly a colonial power in Oman.  Before he took the throne Oman had fewer than 10 kilometers of paved road one hospital and no secondary schools. By 1980 ten years into Qaboos’ rule the country had some 12000 kilometers of asphalt roadways 363 schools and 28 hospitals according to anthropologist Mandana Limbert. The ruler struggled with a bout of health problems and was flown to Belgium last month for treatment for colon cancer after which he was said to be in “stable condition.” Omani authorities offered few additional details about his status after he returned home. Qaboos had no children and never appointed a successor publicly leaving some question about the line of succession. A statute passed in 1996 however tasks the royal family with appointing the next sultan within three days after the throne becomes vacant. Think your friends would be interested?

Haitham bin Tariq Al-Said pledged to follow the late sultan's 'non-interference' policy based on peaceful coexistence and maintaining friendly ties with all nations.

379,Soleimani was killed by a US drone strike on January 3 as he was being driven with others near Baghdad international airport. In reprisal Iran launched a limited strike on US bases in Iraq with ballistic missiles on Tuesday causing no casualties but demonstrating a capability to hit US assets at will. The weekly Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) newspaper Al-Naba portrayed Soleimani’s death as an act of god in support of its cause and Muslims in general according to BBC Monitoring. An editorial in the jihadi paper was careful not to credit the US or even mention Soleimani by name. It couched the gloating in a historical analogy referring to “Roman-Persian wars” that enabled early Muslims to overrun both Persia – today’s Iran – and parts of the Eastern Roman Empire also known as Byzantium. The paper also reported on the US and its allies suspending operations against IS as an opportunity for the group’s resurgence according to BBC journalist Mina Al-Lami. While IS has not been entirely destroyed it has not controlled any territory for months. Soleimani’s Quds Force fighters were among those that turned the tide against the IS ‘caliphate’ alongside the Syrian Army and the Russian expeditionary force in Syria – while the US-backed Iraqi army and Kurdish militias advanced from northern Syria and Iraq. Citing the possibility IS might reappear the US is refusing to withdraw from Iraq in open disregard for its ‘partners’ in the government in Baghdad. Iraqi lawmakers passed a nonbinding resolution demanding US withdrawal shortly after Soleimani’s killing but the US State Department said on Friday that no such thing would be happening. Both the US and several of its NATO allies have suspended their training of Iraqi security forces for the moment as they braced for Iranian reprisals. Some allies even pulled their personnel out of Iraq to neighboring Kuwait. However US President Donald Trump has called for an expanded role for NATO in Iraq. Like this story?

380,The bug’s first fatality was reported in the city of Wuhan early on Saturday by Chinese state media which offered few details beyond the death itself. Unknown to science when it first emerged on the scene the coronavirus has hit Wuhan hardest where it rapidly spread to at least 59 confirmed patients seven of whom are now in critical condition. While the World Health Organization first suggested earlier this week that a SARS-like coronavirus could be driving a spate of severe pneumonia cases – Chinese scientists have now confirmed that suspicion. Chinese health officials have moved to shut down a number of open-air markets and other public meeting places identified as epicenters for the virus fearing they would aid in spreading it to other parts of the country. Several other suspected cases of the illness have also been observed in both Hong Kong and South Korea many of them involving people who'd recently traveled to Wuhan.

381,"The Army General Staff stressed that the tragic mistake was made amid the flare-up of tensions with Washington. The nation's air defenses were placed on alert and ready to ""respond to possible threats of the highest level"" after US President Donald Trump warned that the Pentagon would strike targets on Iranian soil if US citizens or assets were attacked by Iran. On Wednesday the Iranian Army fired a volley of ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq that house American troops. It was a retaliation in response to a US drone strike which killed top Iranian military chief Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad's airport. For several hours after the missile attacks the army was detecting increased activity of US warplanes around the country and received alerts of possible airstrikes on ""strategic sites"" across Iran the General Staff said. The Kiev-bound Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 which took off from Tehran's airport the same day was approaching ""an important military site"" of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) while traveling at the altitude of a ""hostile flight"" the statement noted. The General Staff said that a further investigation will determine all the causes of the incident and those responsible would face consequences. All 176 people on board the airliner were killed in the crash. Most of the victims were Iranian and Canadian nationals. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

383,As Iran and the United States seemingly limbered up for war Russia and Germany as the continent’s two most powerful countries have a special responsibility to protect it from any fallout. Merkel’s decision to travel to the Russian capital may be conceived as a signal to Washington that: a) Berlin remains capable of mounting an independent foreign policy if pushed b) the Germans won’t be cowed by sanctions the US has placed on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline which further connects their country directly to Russia’s gas supply network and c) Merkel wants the US leadership to know she agrees with Moscow about Donald Trump’s order to murder Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Russia has labeled it “reckless” and the Germans have questioned the legality of the killing. Especially given that she was already due to visit Moscow in May for the 75th anniversary of Soviet Russia’s victory over the Nazis. Washington’s move to sanction the pipeline amounted to straight-up racketeering right out of the mafia playbook. It’s trying to force Germany a supposed ally to buy liquefied gas from US companies which is more expensive than the product it gets from long-time supplier Russia. Germany and Russia need each other. They are Europe’s most powerful economies measured by purchasing power parity. And together they are home to around a third of its population. Moscow relies on revenue from its exports to the German market and Berlin would be in serious bother without access to Russian resources. Geopolitically they also complement each other in many ways. From all points west of the Poland-Belarus border Berlin is the most influential player. But east of that and south of the Black Sea Moscow is in the driving seat. The Germans will be eager to see how Moscow’s influence in the Middle East can be leveraged – a region where they have little or no clout. On Saturday there is much to discuss with Libya Syria Iran and Ukraine top of the agenda. Just this week Iran and the US clashed in Iraq and Tehran gave up on an international nuclear deal which both Berlin and Moscow have championed although Donald Trump had already rendered it essentially useless last year. Meanwhile Turkey which both Merkel and Putin view as an important player sent soldiers to Libya.  Ukraine itself is another important issue for the two leaders given that it has driven a wedge between Germany and Russia for well over half a decade now. Put plainly Moscow believes that the EU over-reached by attempting to bring Kiev into its sphere of influence in 2013 although it accepts the heavy lifting was done by pro-US/NATO elements in Brussels and is aware Berlin was never super keen on EU membership for the Ukrainians. The Germans think Russia was overly aggressive in its response to the 2014 ‘Euromaidan.’ Berlin rejects Moscow’s re-absorption of Crimea believing it to be a dangerous ‘precedent’ in redrawing European borders (which of course ignores Germany’s own role in the collapse of Yugoslavia). And it also holds Russia responsible for fueling the Donbass conflict through its support for the self-declared republics. When it comes to Libya Putin and Merkel are basically on the same page – they both want an end to the fighting. They’ve never been especially personally friendly but Putin will miss Merkel when she finally steps down. The German chancellor is the last remaining Western leader who featured in both his stretches as Russian president. This year will be pivotal in terms of what sort of Germany-Russia relationship she leaves behind. The countdown begins on Saturday.

The Ukrainian leader also expressed hope that the probe into the tragedy would continue “without artificial delays and obstacles.” “Our 45 experts must be granted complete access and cooperation” during the investigation Zelensky stressed. While accepting responsibility for the mistake the Iranian Army said its air defenses were placed on high alert because US President Donald Trump had threatened to strike dozen of sites on Iranian territory. The Army General Staff said that they had received reports of possible US airstrikes after which the Ukrainian passenger plane was mistaken for a hostile target because it was flying towards a military installation near Tehran.

Korea's leader and US President Donald Trump might have good personal relations it won't get the two countries anywhere. ""Although Chairman Kim Jong Un has good personal feelings about President Trump they are in the true sense of the word 'personal'"" the statement reads adding that the country's leader ""would not discuss the state affairs on the basis of such personal feelings as he represents our state and its interests."" Washington-Pyongyang negotiations that have blossomed in 2018 and early 2019 turned out to be a waste of time for the country the Foreign Ministry said. The talks have been stalled since March 2019 when Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi flopped. N. Korea will not make any new generous proposals like it did before – for instance dismantling of nuclear facilities in exchange for UN sanctions relief – and won't seek engaging into talks with the US altogether until the latter makes some real concessions first. ""The reopening of dialogue between the DPRK and the U.S. may be possible only under the condition of the latter's absolute agreement on the issues raised by the former but we know well that the US is neither ready nor able to do so"" the statement reads. Pyongyang also did not miss the opportunity to take a jab at its southern counterpart mocking the efforts of Seoul to convey Trump's birthday wishes to Kim and to become a mediator in US-N.

389,The short video was captured by a surveillance camera at a parking lot presumably located on the outskirts of the Iranian capital. Footage shows the launch of a projectile which goes vertically upwards and apparently explodes off-screen causing a bright flash of light. The authenticity of the video however remains under question. The date mark on the footage says it was actually shot on Friday whereas the Boeing went down near Tehran on Wednesday. A car sitting in the parking lot also appears to have had its alarm set-off well before the launch and the flash. It indicates the vehicle had possibly been startled by some loud noises beforehand and the launch seen in the video might have been not the only one.

390,"The INS Vikramaditya with a fleet of MiG-29K fighter jets on board has arrived to monitor large nine-day naval exercise 'Sea Guardians 2020' which was kicked off by Beijing and Islamabad in the northern part of the Arabian Sea on Monday. The Navy spokesperson praised the ""high levels of motivation &amp; #willtowin that were evident onboard the 'Queen of the Battle'"" as the flagship carrier is often called in India. Military sources told PTI that the top officials from the Navy HQ were present on board. They also said that the ship was sent on a voyage with ""a strategic objective"" but did not disclose further details. The carrier was reportedly testing out new hardware as well. A prototype of the HAL Tejas light combat aircraft (LCA) has successfully taken off from the ship's flight deck and landed on it on Saturday military sources told NDTV and Hindustan Times. By doing so the Tejas has become the first Indian-built jet to land on an aircraft carrier. China brought five big warships for its drill with Pakistan including the guided-missile destroyer Yinchuan and the guided-missile frigate Yuncheng while Islamabad sent two Zulfiquar-class frigates among other vessels. Pakistan's Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi said that the joint maneuvers highlight ""the long-term relationship and mutual trust"" between the nations. New Delhi has been tracking the increased activity of Chinese ships in the Indian Ocean. Last month the Indian Navy reported that it had chased away a Chinese surveillance vessel after it had supposedly entered the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in September.  China is also absent from the list of more than 40 nations that India invited to participate in its major Milan 2020 naval drill next year. Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh explained in December that Beijing was not invited because India was calling only the ""like-minded"" countries. India and Pakistan nearly went to an all-out war last February when cross-border shelling was accompanied with the first case of open aerial combat since 1971. After a brief period of friendly gestures the tensions between the neighbors began rising again since last summer as India revoked the longstanding autonomy of the part of the disputed Kashmir it controls and reorganized the region. Indian authorities argue that the changes in Kashmir will help fighting terrorism and that better integration into India proper will boost the region's economy. The country also recently adopted a citizenship law which simplifies naturalization for several religious groups that have arrived from Afghanistan Bangladesh and Pakistan but does not do the same for Muslims. Pakistani officials have blasted the law as discriminatory.

391,“After hearing about the crash of the Ukrainian plane I wished to die” Hajizadeh said during a press conference on Saturday. The commander explained that the incident had occurred as the country was bracing for potential US strikes and that the “likelihood of conflict” between the two nations has been “unprecedented” since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. According to an early assessment the Ukrainian plane was erroneously identified as an incoming cruise missile which resulted in the tragedy. Air-defense units received a warning that cruise missiles had been fired at the country and stayed on high alert at the time of the incident Hajizadeh stated. The commander of the anti-aircraft unit had sought confirmation for the launch from his superiors but experienced communication problems and had to make the decision –which turned out to be wrong– on his own. The officer only had 10 seconds to make the decision Hajizadeh added. Hajizadeh stated that the IRGC notified the authorities that it had likely hit the plane back right after the incident yet this information was not disclosed to the public while the crash site was being investigated. Neither IRGC nor the country’s military sought to hide the incident the due procedure was to be followed he explained. Like this story?

Iran then proposed for the black box to be decoded at an ""impartial"" facility overseas where the data could be extracted without any damage to it. France was chosen because it has an agreement with Iran for extracting data from flight recorders the official explained. The lead investigator stated the decision was supported by the US as well as Ukraine Canada Britain and Sweden whose citizens were on board the doomed plane.

394,The nationwide strike against pension reforms has entered its 38th day in France coinciding with ‘Act 61’ of demonstrations by the Yellow Vests the movement that has been protesting state austerity measures each weekend for over a year now. Tensions this Saturday appear to be particularly high as clashes between the protesters and law enforcement erupted in multiple locations across the country. In Paris the protesters were seen pelting police with stones trying to erect barricades in the streets as well as setting dumpsters on fire. Law enforcement in turn responded with volleys of tear gas that creeped through the streets as a large whitish toxic cloud.  A billboard –reportedly advertising a bank– was also set on fire with flames then engulfing the adjacent residential building.  The rallies in several other French cities appear to be as turbulent as in the country’s capital. In Nantes for instance the police was seen trying to disperse the crowds using two fire hoses as well as liberally deploying tear gas. Scuffles between the police and the protesters have also erupted in Montpellier Caen and other locations. In Rouen the rowdy protesters tried to block the streets with garbage cans and other objects which yet again prompted the police to deploy tear gas as well as to baton charge the crowds. Observers filming the clashes from their apartment ‘received’ a tear gas grenade from the police right into it. Fortunately they escaped the incident unscathed except from suffering exposure to the gas while the grenade left burn marks on their floor. The Rouen incident prompted inevitable comparisons with the fate of Zineb Redouane an 80-year-old woman from Marseille who died a year ago after getting hit by a police grenade in her face. Redouane was at her apartment during a Yellow Vests rally and merely came up to her window to close it when the projectile struck her in the face. The anti-pension-reform protests which have received massive support from French trade unions kicked off early in December. They came in the form of mass rallies strikes work walkouts and attempts to disrupt vital infrastructure. The unrest was triggered by the government plan for a reform that will see the country’s 42 pension plans merged into a single points-based one. While the authorities insist the main goal of the reform is to make the pension more transparent and simple its critics believe the government is basically trying to rip workers off stealing their hard-earned benefits.

395,Both leaders believe that the 2015agreement also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) still can and should be preserved despite the latest spike in tensions sparked by the US assassination of a top Iranian general. Speaking to journalists in Moscow following her meeting with Putin Merkel said that “everything must be done to keep the JCPOA going” and vowed to use “all the diplomatic tools to help this agreement.” Putin also described the deal as “tremendously important” and said that both Moscow and Berlin agree that all parties need to “come back to the deal.” Iran has rolled back all the restrictions it had committed-to under the 2015 nuclear deal following the US assassination of Quds Force commander Major General Qassem Soleimani as well as a barrage of crippling sanctions imposed by Washington after America itself left the agreement. Putin further expressed hope that a special-purpose vehicle called INSTEX Europe created to facilitate trade with Iran and circumvent US sanctions would soon “be up and running” and that European nations “would deliver on their promise to create an independent mechanism free of the dollar influence.” So far Europe’s endeavors in this area have not been particularly successful. The mechanism was originally created in early 2019 but was apparently limited to what the European nations called high-priority “humanitarian goods” such as food and medical supplies. Meanwhile European companies have been in no rush to trade with Iran out of fear of losing the American market as a result of possible sanctions.

396,Demonstrators gathered in the Kelvingrove Park from where they set out on a march to the Glasgow Green Park around 11:30 GMT. Crowds of people flooded the streets in the center of Scotland’s largest city. The marchers were waving Scottish national flags and were holding banners and placards in support of the referendum as well as of Scotland’s independence from the UK. A group of demonstrators were wearing kilts — a part of the Scottish national costume — and were playing bagpipes. The march was organized by a grassroots pro-independence movement ‘All Under One Banner’ (AUOB) which insists it is not aligned with any political force. It is the first such event out of at least eight that the group plans to hold across Scotland this year. The next one is scheduled for April and will be held in Arbroath on the 700th anniversary of the signing of Scotland’s declaration of independence. Initially AUOB also planned to stage a rally after the march but it was called off due to safety concerns in light of weather warnings. This fact however did not apparently discourage people from turning to the streets in support of the referendum. The exact number of demonstrators is not known yet the organizers expected up to 100000 to attend the event. Scotland already held a referendum in 2014 when the push for independence was defeated in a narrow popular vote as 55 percent of those who took part in it chose to stay in the UK. Yet after the Scottish National Party gained 45 percent of the votes during the latest UK general elections in Scotland and won 48 out of 59 Scottish seats in the House of Commons the idea of another referendum was once again put on the table by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. Speaking a week after the general elections Sturgeon said that her government has “a clear democratic mandate to offer people a choice on that future in an independence referendum and the UK Government has a democratic duty to recognize that.” She also vowed to consider “all options” should the British government turn down her bid for the second referendum. Yet that appears exactly what London plans to do. In December the UK government rejected Sturgeon’s demands arguing that it would be a “damaging distraction” for the UK after it leaves the EU.

401,It appears Meghan Markle has traded in the royal family for Hollywood as a new report reveals she has signed a deal to do voiceover work for Disney. The move follows Markle and her husband Prince Harry announcing they are taking a step back from the royal family and becoming financially independent.  Markle who was an actress long before she was Duchess of Sussex will perform voiceover work for Disney in exchange for a donation to Elephants Without Borders an organization that works to protect animals from poaching.  While a noble goal the donation could also be viewed as a PR spin considering Markle has been dealing with bad press following her and Prince Harry’s decision to move on from the royal family. If good PR was the goal it does not seem to have worked as many are taking news of Markle’s Disney deal as another sign of her trying to build her celebrity status at the expense of her husband. “This woman has always been absolutely desperate to be a celebrity” commenter Katie Hopkins said of Markle in a video that has been viewed more than half-a-million times. The report from The Times suggests members of the royal family were aware of the Disney deal before Christmas and were not happy about it.

403,German Chancellor Angela Merkel also called for an end to hostilities between the two warring sides in the troubled North African country after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow earlier on Sunday and promised to hold a peace conference in Berlin. The Tripoli-based internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) confirmed that the head of the Presidency Council agreed to a ceasefire “starting 00:00 on Jan. 12.” The ceasefire is conditioned on the rival side upholding it LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said. The truce was suggested by Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul earlier this week but Haftar initially rejected it. “We welcome Putin’s call for a ceasefire. However our fight against terrorist organizations that seized Tripoli and received support of some countries will continue until the end” he said through a representative. Haftar’s position seems to have changed now. The Tripoli-based government led by PM Fayez al-Sarraj backed the ceasefire immediately releasing a statement late Wednesday that showed its full support for “any serious calls for the resumption of the political process and the elimination of the specter of war.” Libya has been torn apart by warring factions seeking control of the nation since a US-led NATO intervention to overthrow the government of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The Libyan National Army controls most of the country but the GNA is internationally recognized. The fighting between the two sides intensified over the last few months with the LNA advancing towards Tripoli and Turkey sending troops to support the government there. Other countries have also become involved recently: Italian PM Giuseppe Conte met with Haftar in Rome and Sarraj met with European Council President Charles Michel and EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell in Brussels. Germany suggested holding a peace conference in Berlin to find a political solution to the conflict.  Think your friends would be interested?

404,“To the brave long-suffering people of Iran: I’ve stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency and my Administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely and are inspired by your courage” Trump wrote both in English and Farsi addressing the protesters in Iran. “The world is watching” Trump said in a separate tweet warning the government of Iran against “another massacre of peaceful protesters” and demanding it “allow human rights groups to monitor and report facts from the ground.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s meddling in Iran’s domestic affairs was even more blatant stopping just short of an open call for a regime change. “The voice of the Iranian people is clear” Pompeo stated tweeting out footage of the protest in Iran. Earlier on Saturday the British ambassador to Iran Rob Macaire was briefly detained outside of Amirkabir University in Tehran over his alleged role in “inciting and directing” anti-government protesters. The UK Foreign Office called it a “flagrant violation of international law” insisting that Macaire was detained without any “grounds or explanation.” The General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces admitted that Flight 752 was shot down on Wednesday due to human error on the day that Tehran was responding to the US assassination of General Qassem Soleimani.  Offering his condolences to the victims’ families Iranian President Hassan Rouhani apologized for the “disastrous mistake” on behalf of Iran fully acknowledging that the tragedy was caused by the erroneous actions of his country’s military.

407,“I repeat again Citizenship Act is not to revoke anyone’s citizenship but it is to give citizenship” Modi said on Sunday at a rally at Belur Math Monastery in the state of West Bengal bordering Bangladesh.  “Our government has only delivered on the wishes of our great freedom fighters who got us Independence. We’ve only done what Mahatma Gandhi had said decades ago” Modi said. He once again stressed that people “are being misled” about the law. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which was adopted last year makes it easier to obtain citizenship for people of six religious groups that have arrived from Afghanistan Pakistan and Bangladesh but does not do the same for Muslims. The legislation sparked protests and was accused by the opposition and some celebrities of being discriminatory. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan earlier slammed India’s policy as anti-Muslim.

410,"Qasym-Jomart Toqayev wrote on Twitter that Iran's decision to admit responsibility for the downing of the plane was ""an important"" one. Kazakhstani Foreign Minister Mukhtar Tleuberdi had previously expressed concern over the “deterioration” of the situation in the Middle East in a phone call with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif. The Iranian army said its air defenses mistook the Kiev-bound Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 for a hostile target amid the flare-up with the US and shot the plane down after it took off from Tehran’s airport on Wednesday killing all 176 people on board. Iran fired ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq housing US troops and was bracing for possible American airstrikes that day. The missile attack was a response to an earlier US drone strike in Iraq that killed Iranian high-ranking military commander Qassem Soleimani who the US accused of plotting terrorist attacks. Tehran promised a transparent probe into the tragedy and to punish those responsible.

411,The eruption began on Sunday and was caught on video by numerous bystanders as well as surveillance cameras used to monitor the volcano. While Taal has been quiet since 1977 when the last major eruption occurred it has been exhibiting increased seismic activity over the past few years. The initial eruption is described as phreatic – meaning it occurs when heated magma evaporates ground or surface water. The plume darkened shortly afterwards indicating that the steam was joined by actual volcanic ash.  As if footage of the eruption didn’t already look menacing enough several lightning strikes have been observed in the area. The lightning bolts were seen hitting the center of the ash column which is towering over the volcano. As well as ‘enjoying’ a doomsday view nearby communities have experienced an ashfall shortly after the eruption. The eruption has prompted the evacuation of people living in the immediate vicinity of the volcano with some 8000 locals affected. Communities on the shores of the Taal lake were told to watch out for potential water disturbances and high waves that might be created by the increased seismic activity. The spike in the mountain's activities prompted the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) to upgrade its threat level twice within an hour. The alert level skyrocketed from 'abnormal' to 'magmatic unrest' suggesting that the volcano might even spew some lava.  Later in the day the alert was raised even further and now it stands at level four – ‘hazardous eruption imminent.’ The complex volcano rises from the waters of its namesake lake featuring a number of craters. Its largest crater has a small lake of its own.   The Taal belongs to the so-called 'Decade Volcanos' – 16 mountains known for violent and deadly eruptions in the past and therefore considered worthy of close study and monitoring. The greatest recorded eruption of the Taal occurred back in 1754 and lasted for nearly eight months. The deadliest eruption occurred in 1911 claiming the lives of over 1300 people and effectively wiping out all human settlements on the volcanic island. Think your friends would be interested?

412,"“Today Rob Macaire was summoned because of his unconventional behavior of attending an illegal rally on Saturday” the Iranian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It also demanded that the British government provide clarification on the matter. The diplomat was briefly detained late on Saturday outside of Amirkabir University in Tehran as part of a group of people attending a chaotic vigil – held for the victims of the Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crash – which turned into an anti-government rally. According to Iranian state media the official was seeking “to organize instigate and direct some radical and destructive actions.” While many people brought candles and flowers to the event seeking to mourn the dead some showed up with anti-government banners and began chanting slogans demanding “prosecutions and constitutional changes.” The event escalated into clashes between the police and protesters who were ultimately dispersed. The ambassador however maintains that he was only seeking to attend the vigil. The Ukrainian plane was accidentally downed by Iranian air defenses on Wednesday after the passenger jet was mistaken for an incoming cruise missile. “Thanks for the many goodwill messages. Can confirm I wasn’t taking part in any demonstrations! Went to an event advertised as a vigil for victims of #PS752 tragedy” the diplomat tweeted earlier on Sunday insisting that he was detained half an hour after he left the event. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the incident a “flagrant violation of international law” insisting that Macaire was detained without any ""grounds or explanation.” Commenting on the issue the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell called for “de-escalation and space for diplomacy”. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the British ambassador was arrested “because of his participation in an illegal gathering” but he was released “due to his diplomatic immunity and after confirming his identity”. The country´s Deputy FM Seyed Abbas Araghchi explained in a tweet that he was deeply surprised the arrested man turned to be the UK ambassador. Meanwhile Macaire’s participation in the rally – whatever his true motive – prompted an angry reaction from the Basij militia. The militia – which is subordinate to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – staged a rally outside the UK embassy and according to local media demanded its closure.

Modi also called Qaboos “a beacon of peace for our region and the world.” Qaboos who passed away at 79 on Friday after ruling Oman for five decades was known as a skilled mediator and described by experts as India’s key partner in the Persian Gulf region. He also studied in India as a young man. India is among Oman’s top trading partners and according to the Economic Times bilateral trade reached $5 billion in 2018/19.

414,"The volcano erupted on Sunday emitting a large column of steam and smoke and subjecting the surroundings to a heavy ashfall. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) has revised the alert level of the volcano several times through the day and currently it stands at level four – out of five possible – ‘hazardous eruption imminent’. The institute said two volcanic earthquakes have been registered while volcanic tremor persisted since 0300 am GMT. Earlier Manila international airport has suspended flights over the eruption of the Taal volcano located some 55 km to the south. ""Flight operations at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport have been temporarily suspended due to the volcanic ash from the eruption of Taal Volcano"" the Manila International Airport Authority stated. The eruption prompted the evacuation of some 8000 people living in the immediate vicinity of the restless hill which is located on an island in the waters of its namesake lake. People living in the communities on the shores of Taal Lake have been warned that the seismic activity could trigger potentially hazardous high waves. Heavy ashfall was recorded in the province of Cavite – located between the volcano and the capital city of Manila – prompting authorities to suspend classes at all levels on Monday. Affected residents are urged to stay indoors and to use dust masks and goggles if going outside is an absolute necessity.

415,“I believe the US sanctions will delay the project but will not end it” Mateusz Morawiecki told German newspaper Die Welt in an interview. Swiss-Dutch pipe-laying company Allseas stopped its work on the pipeline in December through fear of getting hit by the sanctions which were adopted by the US earlier that month. Morawiecki whose government argues that the project will make the EU too dependent on Russian gas called Berlin’s decision not to abandon Nord Stream 2 a “step in the wrong direction.”  “In Poland naturally we would prefer that the construction of Nord Stream 2 would have never begun” he said. The PM noted that despite Poland “regularly” voicing its concerns over the pipeline to German Chancellor Angela Merkel it “doesn’t change the fact that Warsaw and Berlin have different opinions on this issue.” Merkel has strongly opposed US attempts to derail the construction of the pipeline arguing that it will be beneficial for both Germany and the EU. During a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Saturday the chancellor stressed that Nord Stream 2 “will be implemented no matter what” and vowed to continue her support for the project. Putin said that Russia is capable of completing the project on its own and that although construction could take a few months longer it would be finished “either by the end of this year or early next year”.

416,Pickering power plant located on the shore of Lake Ontario sent out an alert stating that emergency staff are responding to an incident at the facility although “there has been no abnormal release of radioactivity from the station.” It also said that locals do not need to evacuate or take any other protective measures. Still scarce information about the nature of the supposed incident apparently did not reassure residents and the alert certainly got under the skin of quite a few people. They in turn soon sent Twitter into meltdown as hundreds of people turned to social media to voice their fears and skepticism about whether the situation was really safe. The panic on Twitter soon reached such proportions that #Chernobyl started trending in a matter of minutes. However it quickly turned out that the alarm was in fact false and there was no incident at the station so the alert was called off. It seems that not everyone was convinced though that there was no reason to remain alert. Others criticized Pickering power plant for issuing a false alert and sarcastically joked about the station’s staff not being particularly good at their jobs. Commissioned back in the early 1970s Pickering Nuclear Generating Station is the third-largest such facility in Canada. Located on the northern shore of Lake Ontario it currently has six operating reactors and generates about 15 percent of the province’s power. Like this story?

417,“We're willing to sit down and discuss without precondition a new way forward a series of steps by which Iran becomes a more normal country” Esper said on Sunday speaking on CBS’s ‘Face the Nation’.  Asked whether there was a contradiction between calling the Iranian authorities “corrupt” and openly siding with anti-government protesters yet expressing readiness to talk at the same time Esper assured the show’s host that it was a perfectly fine thing to do. Iranian authorities are “still a legitimate government” of the country he said and therefore Donald Trump’s offer to come and talk “without preconditions” still stands. His words come as the president and other US officials are busy issuing warnings to Tehran on how to deal with protests over the downing of a Ukrainian passenger jet. On Saturday the US president even went to the trouble of tweeting in both English and Farsi appealing directly to the Iranian protesters and expressing his full – and years-long – support for them. “To the brave long-suffering people of Iran: I’ve stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency and my Administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely and are inspired by your courage” Trump wrote warning Tehran against “another massacre of peaceful protesters” in a separate tweet. In fact senior US officials have repeatedly expressed willingness to talk to Tehran “with no preconditions” calling upon it to “behave like a normal nation.” While this definition appears vague it was actually summed up by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in June 2018 when yet another call for talks was accompanied by a list of demands which basically urged Iran to give up its independent policies and surrender to Washington to become a “normal country” again. Needless to say these ‘no-precondition’ proposals for talks tend to fall flat and only spark anger in Tehran. Think your friends would be interested?

418,Though his opening monologue and razor sharp jokes from this year’s Golden Globes telecast went viral and were heavily celebrated online Ricky Gervais no doubt made producers a little too uncomfortable with his takedown of Hollywood’s empty political activism as well as shining a light on the industry turning a blind eye to the deeds of people like disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein and the late Jeffrey Epstein. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler have been announced as the hosts of the 2021 ceremony. The pair last performed the task in 2015. NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association released statements about their excitement to have the two return but the decision isn’t going over too well with fans of Gervais’ Globes performance. “And with that move and the exit of Ricky Gervais with the inclusion of these two self-styled comedic wits with all of that the Golden Globes never again enjoyed a moment of their theretofore enjoyed popularity ever again” wrote one Twitter user in response.  “What @goldenglobes⁩ ?? No ⁦@rickygervais⁩ ?? Too bad. That’s the only way you would get big viewer numbers!! I’ll select ‘opt out’ to your lame self-indulging elitist awards” tweeted another user.  Fey and Poehler are about as far away from Gervais as you can get comedically. The two SNL alums cut their teeth as hosts making soft celebrity-friendly jokes and playing it safe. Fey made a name for herself by impersonating one of the easiest targets on the planet former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and Poehler has said Trump being president makes it “hard not to have a full-on panic attack every day.” Nothing says playing it safe in Hollywood like planting your flag as far to the political left as possible.  And zingers from past shows hosted by the two include Fey dropping dimes like “Meryl Streep is so brilliant in ‘August: Osage County’ proving that there are still great parts in Hollywood for Meryl Streeps over 60.” Wow. Cutting edge. Brutal. Gervais on the other hand has a comedy style that protects no one. Even the celebrities in the room are on the table. His opening monologue at the last ceremony was so brilliant because it was a takedown of the award show itself and the political elitist mess it had devolved into. With Fey and Poehler there won’t be discomfort in the room. There won’t be Weinstein jokes. There won’t be Epstein jokes. That may disappoint fans but it’s exactly what producers want after Gervais put their feet to the fire and laughed. Hollywood may love to lecture us but it definitely does not like being lectured.  Like this story? Share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/478076-golden-globes-gervais-fey/,None
419,At least eight ‘Katyusha’ rockets hit the base located some 80 kilometers north of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad the prime minister’s office has confirmed. The rockets allegedly struck a runaway located inside the facility military sources earlier told Reuters. There have been no casualties among the US military personnel. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the strikes somewhat surprisingly without immediately pinning the blame on ‘Iranian proxies’. US bases in Iraq were also hit by a ballistic missile attack from Iran on January 8. The move almost put the two nations on the brink of war but a large-scale conflict was eventually avoided. It is still unclear who might be behind the repeated attacks on the Iraqi base hosting American troops but such actions do not fit the strategy of Iran or the Popular Mobilization Forces – a group of Iran-backed Shia militias – Ammar Waqqaf a Middle East analyst told RT.  “These attacks use non-precise weapons. The margins of error are huge. Even if there were American forces at this base it is still not a solely American base there are Iraqi soldiers there. So whoever targets this base does not necessarily care about the Iraqi army or personnel” he said adding that Tehran eventually decided to focus on pushing American forces out of Iraq and out of the Middle East in general through diplomacy and influence on its neighbors rather than through military means. In fact anti-Iranian sentiment which has been on the rise in Iraq for quite some time went down in the wake of the assassination of Soleimani by the US Waqqaf noted adding that “there was some sympathy and unification among key factions” in Iraq. Tehran or pro-Iranian forces in Iraq would gain little if they shattered this unity by hitting some Iraqi personnel in an attack supposedly aimed against the US. Following the US's assassination of Soleimani the Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding resolution last week asking the government to expel foreign troops and to cancel the ongoing request for military assistance from the US-led coalition. Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi also asked US State Secretary Mike Pompeo to send a delegation to begin preparations for a troop pullout. Washington however made it clear that it would not discuss any withdrawal plans calling the US presence on Iraqi soil “appropriate.” Think your friends would be interested?

420,Secretary of Defense Mark Esper revealed in a Sunday interview with ‘Face the Nation’ on CBS that he “didn’t see” specific evidence that supported the president’s claim that Soleimani was planning attacks on four US embassies which Trump touted in a Friday interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham. “The president said that he believed that there probably could have been attacks against additional embassies” Esper said to host Margaret Brennan. “I shared that view. I know other members of the national security team shared that view.” “‘Probably and could have been’ that is — that sounds more like an assessment than a specific tangible threat with a decisive piece of intelligence” Brennan replied. “Well the president didn’t say there was a tangible — he didn’t cite a specific piece of evidence” Esper said. Asked if there was any specific evidence Esper then replied “I didn’t see one with regard to four embassies. What I’m saying is I shared the president’s view that probably my expectation is they were going to go after our embassies.” Esper later told CNN’s Jake Tapper that the president never claimed to have “specific evidence” of the imminent attacks he has warned Americans about.  The administration’s shaky reasoning for Soleimani’s assassination has earned them plenty of heat with some saying they can’t “keep their story straight.” “The public justification for this action has been all over the place from the beginning. They cannot keep their story straight. They’re just throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. Admitting it was an ideological revenge killing would be much more honest” journalist Mike Tracey tweeted in response to Esper’s ‘Face the Nation’ interview. Utah Senator Mike Lee similarly criticized the administration in a CNN interview where he said it’s “frustrating” to have the president warn of “imminent” attacks but to get “no details” about said attacks or the evidence behind the claims. Others saw it as the latest example of Trump lying. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also recently failed to provide any concrete evidence about the potential danger of Soleimani when he spoke to the press. Pompeo insisted Trump was given “multiple pieces of information” in regard to “imminent” dangers against the US but he failed to detail what that information was.  Despite struggling to explain the “imminence” of the situation Pompeo insisted “we got it right” with the assassination. He also insisted that “If you’re looking for imminence you needn’t look no further than the days that lead up to the strike.” If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/478078-trump-soleimani-esper-evidence/,None
421,"US officials and establishment figures certainly spared no effort as they went out of their way to show how much they supposedly admire the ‘courage’ of Iranians who took to the streets to vent their anger at the fact that a Ukrainian passenger jet with many Iranians on board was mistakenly shot down by Iran's military – something Tehran admitted of its own volition before the results of the crash investigation were made public. However Washington apparently decided that this tragedy which took the lives of 176 people is a good enough reason to remind Iranians – who are already consumed by grief – just how much they are ‘suffering’ at the hands of a supposedly ‘oppressive’ regime that by sheer coincidence turns out to be America's arch-rival in the region. President Donald Trump spent the last couple of days tweeting compliments to the protesters and warnings to Tehran both in English and in Farsi. On Sunday he demanded that Tehran ""stop the killing of your great Iranian people."" There are no reports of deaths during the protests over the plane downing even though law enforcement had to deploy tear gas and water cannons against an agitated crowd on several occasions. Earlier the president went so far as to remind Iranians that he – who vowed just days ago to annihilate 52 targets on Iranian soil in the event of a conflict with Iran including prominent cultural sites – has allegedly stood with them since the beginning of his presidency. Other US officials also wasted little time before they joined the cheering chorus of the Iranian protesters' supporters. American Ambassador to the UK Woody Johnson took to social media on Sunday to express his admiration for the protesters and ""call out the cruel Khamenei regime."" Pentagon Chief Mark Esper meanwhile hinted at how Washington really views the protests sparked by the downing of the Ukrainian jet. ""You can see the Iranian people are standing up and asserting their rights their aspirations for a better government — a different regime"" he told CBS's 'Face the Nation'. Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton – a notorious American arch-hawk and a big fan of the idea of launching a war against Iran – was much blunter in his words openly stating that ""regime change is in the air"" and ""the people of Iran can see it."" State Secretary - and former CIA Chief - Mike Pompeo was the first though to try his hand at interpreting the ""voice of the Iranian people"" and stopped just short of openly calling for a regime change on Saturday. It is true that Iran is still reeling from the tragic Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crash. Aggrieved Iranians are hitting the streets of Tehran for the second day amid growing public outcry over the government's actions. When it comes to America's adversaries though any sign of protest sparks a keen interest in Washington. The reasons for this interest however do not appear to be humanitarian. During previous protests in Iran sparked by the rise in fuel costs Pompeo urged Iranians to send him videos of the police crackdown – but only so that “champions of democracy” in Washington could impose even more sanctions against the rival nation.

422,Netanyahu requested immunity after he was indicted in November on charges of bribery fraud and breach of public trust saying he needs “to continue to lead Israel to great achievements.” On Sunday Eyal Yinon the Knesset’s legal adviser issued a ruling that Speaker Yuli Edelstein should allow the formation of a Knesset House Committee that will look into the matter and is expected to reject the request. Edelstein who is part of Netanyahu’s Likud Party warned at a press conference in Jerusalem that “convening the Knesset committee” is a “grave mistake” as it will turn the legal process into a “jungle that will debase the honor of the legislative body.” Yinon delivered his opinion shortly before Edelstein’s press conference and said the speaker does not have the authority to block the formation of a committee to debate Netanyahu’s request for immunity.  When requesting immunity Netanyahu said it was only “temporary” and that “there is no possibility for anyone to avoid standing trial.” The prime minister has denied any wrongdoing and said that immunity laws exist to protect “elected officials from political lawsuits.” Israel has been facing political turmoil for quite some time with close election results in April and September last year preventing the formation of a government. A committee can usually only be formed afterthe government has been sworn in but with Yinon’s ruling this means one will need to be formed anyway. When Netanyahu’s request is rejected as many expect to happen then a corruption trial can officially begin.  And with Israel’s general election set for March 2 Netanyahu may become the first sitting prime minister to enter an election while on trial.

423,While speaking on ABC’s ‘This Week’ Pelosi told host George Stephanopoulos that “this president is impeached for life regardless of any gamesmanship on the part of Mitch McConnell.” While Congress passed articles of impeachment against the president he still technically needs to go through a trial in the Senate to determine his guilt. One is not “impeached” until a decision is made through a trial. Congress merely conducted an inquiry into accusations that Trump tried pressuring Ukraine into investigating political rival Joe Biden in exchange for foreign aid. His guilt or innocence would not be officially determined until the Senate votes and with Republicans holding a majority there and the case against the president flimsy at best it’s highly unlikely he will actually get impeached. A Senate trial is expected to begin within the next few weeks.  Claiming victory on impeachment was not the only odd statement from Pelosi in her Sunday interview. She also at one point claimed Democrats are “in court” fighting to get Ukraine-specific witnesses to comply with subpoenas put out by Congress. The administration had previously told officials not to comply with the investigation. “We are in court on the witnesses. It could take a very long time” Pelosi said after Stephanopoulos played a clip of Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins questioning Democrats not legally pursuing compliance with their subpoenas.  People to defy congressional subpoenas from the House include Rudy Giuliani one of Trump’s personal lawyers and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. Such a crime can land a person in jail for a year and slapped with a $100000 fine but no one has been sweating the consequences too much. When asked about the House potentially taking him to court over defying a subpoena Giuliani simply said “we will see what happens.” It’s unclear what Pelosi means by being “in court” anyway since no Ukraine-specific witnesses have been pursued in court.  The only cases being pursued by Democrats in court are related to grand jury material from Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian collusion in the 2016 presidential election and a motion to force Don McGahn to testify about accusations of obstruction of justice related to that same investigation. Again neither of these two cases have anything to do with the Ukraine investigation. Despite Pelosi’s dubious comments Trump critics still took to Twitter to celebrate her “impeached for life” claim and even got the phrase trending. Think your friends would be interested?

424,The proposal to legalize sex work is sponsored by four female lawmakers and is currently pending in the House Judiciary Committee. Rep. Selene Colburn a cosponsor of the bill and a member of the Progressive Party said decriminalizing sex work would improve the health and safety of prostitutes.  She added that prostitutes should feel they have the “protection of the police if they need it.” Other sponsors of the bill are Diana Wolnooski Maxine Grad and Emilie Kornheiser.  Nevada is currently the only jurisdiction in the United States to allow some prostitution. There are active brothels in seven counties in the state. There is a growing push from left-wing liberals and more Libertarian-minded conservatives to legalize sex work in more jurisdictions. Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders who is a senator from Vermont said last summer that he would be open to decriminalizing prostitution. The Libertarian Party has also endorsed decriminalizing sex work but their 2016 candidate Gary Johnson received less than four percent of the popular vote in the election so one could argue that the ideas of the party are not exactly mainstream. There was even a bill introduced to decriminalize prostitution in Washington DC last year. In a fierce debate more than 100 people testified for and against it. The DC Council Committee ultimately did not vote on the bill. Some argue that decriminalizing prostitution will increase the demand for sex workers which will increase the demand for human trafficking a point made in a Harvard Law and International Development report. Colburn and others believe though that by decriminalizing the act the government is not driving sex workers “underground” and they would essentially be ending black markets and giving protections to those who take part in the exchange. Social conservatives however remain staunchly against the idea of legalizing sex work accusing the ‘pimp lobby’ of seeking to increase their profits from the sex trade rather than caring for anyone’s safety or wellbeing.

425,"“Actually I couldn’t care less if they negotiate. Will be totally up to them but no nuclear weapons and 'don’t kill your protesters'” Trump said in a tweet Sunday night contradicting the narrative of National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien. O'Brien told Fox News earlier that he believes the “maximum pressure"" sanctions campaign which cripples Iran's economy coupled with anti-government protests in the streets are working and Tehran is now being forced into a corner. President Donald Trump spent the last couple of days tweeting support to the protesters and warnings to Tehran both in English and Farsi. On Sunday he demanded that Tehran ""stop the killing of your great Iranian people.""  There are no confirmed reports of deaths during the latest protests even though law enforcement had to deploy tear gas and water cannons against an agitated crowd on several occasions. Meanwhile the UK envoy’s detention during an anti-government rally in Tehran sparked a diplomatic scandal. Rob Macaire was arrested outside of Amirkabir University in Tehran as part of a group of people attending a chaotic vigil held for the victims of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crash which turned into an anti-government rally. According to Iranian state media the official was seeking “to organize instigate and direct some radical and destructive actions.” The envoy summoned on Sunday by the Iranian Foreign Ministry says he was at a “peaceful vigil” for the victims of the plane crash.

426,Debriefing a session of Iran’s parliament on Sunday Salami stated that the IRGC has no other purpose or wish “but to be torn into pieces for the sake of the security welfare and peace of [the Iranian] people.” Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was misidentified as an incoming cruise missile according to Iran’s military which was on high alert at the time of the incident following a strike against US assets in Iraq. According to the IRGC the military never sought to hide the incident and immediately notified the authorities but this information was not immediately disclosed publicly pending an internal probe as due procedure was to be followed. Among the 176 people who perished in the tragedy 147 were Iranians – including dozens of students with dual Canadian citizenship. Some of the mass vigils held for the victims across Iran turned into anti-government rallies while Western officials and establishment figures wasted no time showing how much they admire the ‘courage’ of the Iranians who took to the streets to vent their anger and clash with authorities.

430,In a lawsuit filed to the Bombay High Court and cited by local media make-up artist Srikant Sabnis 40 alleges that his biological mother willfully abandoned him when he was just two years old. Sabnis claims that in September 1981 his mother Aarti Mhaskar left his hometown of Pune for Mumbai to seek a job in the film industry. According to the plaintiff the woman left her infant son on the train once they arrived in the city. The boy was found by a railway officer and was sent to an orphanage the lawsuit says after which he was forced “to live like a beggar” until his grandmother obtained custody over him. The plaintiff allegedly did not learn the identity of his mother until 2017 and met her a year later. According to the lawsuit the woman admitted to leaving Sabnis nearly four decades ago due to “unavoidable circumstances” but she and her current husband asked him not to reveal who he really is in front of their other children. Having already suffered a “dreadful” life because of his abandonment at an early age Sabnis was “totally devastated by this unacceptable condition” the lawsuit says. He now wants Mhaskar to officially recognize him as her son and seeks 15 million rupees (US$212000) in compensation for moral damages. “The plaintiff has undergone a life full of agony mental trauma inconvenience mystery about his own parents and his existence” the lawsuit says.

431,Authorities say it could occur “within hours or days.” The volcano located some 70km (44 miles) south of the capital Manila spewed lava early on Monday. There was a brief respite from activity immediately after the lava release but Taal continued erupting later in the day. Sporadic “lava fountaining” and releases of steam continued throughout Monday the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) said. The volcano has also opened a handful of new lateral vents in the northern part of its main crater. The Taal’s first eruption in decades began on Sunday when the volcano produced a large column of steam followed by massive ash emissions. The eruption created a menacing-looking cloud of ash which has been repeatedly hit by volcanic lightning.  The eruption caused a massive ash fall which affected the areas lying primarily to the north of the volcano. The ash cloud caused a temporary shutdown of Manila’s international airport and cancellation of at least 240 domestic and international flights. The ashfall also prompted the closure of schools and businesses on Monday while citizens were urged to stay at home and wear masks and dust goggles if going outside was a must. In some areas the ash fall was followed by rain which turned the ash into thick mud hampering relief and evacuation efforts. So far about 8000 people have been evacuated from the communities in the immediate vicinity. While most of the initial ash has largely settled the ongoing eruptions continue to produce new emissions. The ash however appeared to be heading in a new direction on Monday and heavy ash fall has been reported to the southwest of the volcano. The alert level raised by the PHIVOLCS several times throughout Sunday remains at level four – out of a possible five. The eruption also prompted a tsunami alert which also remains in place. The volcano is located in the middle of its namesake lake and shore communities have been warned about the potential emergence of hazardous waves due to volcanic tremors. The Taal might not look very imposing – it’s one of the world’s smallest volcanoes – but it is one of the so-called Decade Volcanoes. There are only 16 such volcanoes around the globe boasting such a designation meaning they are known for violent and deadly eruptions and are therefore worthy of close monitoring and study. The last major eruption of the Taal Volcano occurred in 1977 while the deadliest one recorded happened in 1911 killing over 1300 people and destroying all the settlements on the island.

432,"“Hands and tongues smeared with threatening sanctioning and terrorizing the #Iranian nation are not entitled to dishonor the ancient #Persian language” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Abbas Mousavi tweeted on Monday. Mousavi was responding to Trump´s tweet in Persian Iran's official language which is also known as Farsi. The US leader backed the anti-government protests in the Islamic Republic and promised to ""continue to stand"" with the Iranian people. On January 3 a US drone strike in Iraq killed high-ranking Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani who Washington accused of plotting terrorist attacks. Soleimani's funeral procession drew massive crowds in several cities across Iran and was attended by over a million mourners in Tehran alone.  Trump also Farsi to call on the Iranian government “not to kill protesters” and express that it’s “totally up to” Iran to start negotiations as he “couldn’t care less.”  Iranian government spokesperson Ali Rabiei said that Iranians “saw how Trump was shedding crocodile tears” as he claimed to stand by them. Rabiei recalled that Trump had threatened to bomb sites which are important to “Iranian culture” after the “assassination of the country’s most popular commander.” The official also noted that Trump slapped Tehran with sweeping sanctions which are the “root cause” of the economic problems that Iranians are facing today including food and drug shortages. The protesters meanwhile are denouncing the Iranian authorities after they admitted to having mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian passenger airliner amid the dramatic flare-up of tensions with the US.

433,An explosive charge was reportedly placed on the gate outside a property in the area at roughly 1am local time in the Östermalm area. The blast which completely destroyed one vehicle damaged several others and blew the windows out of apartments along the entire street could be heard several kilometers away. No one was injured in the incident but 30 residents were evacuated immediately as a precaution and spent the night at emergency accommodation in a local school.  “We believe that the explosion happened in or at the building but exactly where is still unclear. There are damaged cars nearby but the explosion probably didn’t happen in them” Stockholm police spokesperson Mats Eriksson said Monday. A staircase was reportedly severely damaged which may have prompted the ongoing evacuation. In addition a door was blown to the opposite side of the street by the sheer force of the explosion which also took out a large section of an apartment balcony.  The Swedish bomb squad was also deployed to the scene to begin their investigations into the circumstances of the explosion. However just two hours after the Stockholm blast there was another suspicious explosion reported in the university town of Uppsala roughly an hour away. Again one building and several vehicles were damaged in the explosion but there were no reports of any injuries. Police have not indicated whether the explosions were connected.  Sweden’s authorities are struggling to curb a spate of bombings which has swept the country in recent months despite the establishment of a specialized task force.

434,The revelation was made by the king during an exclusive interview with France 24 which aired on Monday. The monarch said that his “major concern is that we have seen over the past year the re-establishment and rise of ISIS not only in southern eastern Syria but also in western Iraq.” Ironically the timeframe given by King Abdullah corresponds with the announcement of a decisive victory over IS by US President Donald Trump who repeatedly praised himself for the achievement in early 2019. After said ‘victory’ however the terrorist group is apparently on the rise again. Moreover thousands of fighters have moved from Syria into another of the region’s terrorist hotspots the king stated implying they were able to travel there through Turkey. Such a flow of extremists brings the whole Middle Eastern mess significantly closer to the EU – and the bloc must deal with it as soon as possible. The interview comes ahead of King Abdullah’s EU tour with the monarch scheduled to engage in talks in Brussels Strasbourg and Paris later this week. The situation in Libya – and the inflow of terrorists the war-torn country endures – will be among the main topics of discussion with the European leaders. “From a European perspective with Libya being much closer to Europe this is going to be an important discussion in the next couple of days” Abdullah said.

435,Writing in his local newspaper Sir Desmond Swayne the Conservative MP for New Forest West suggested that food banks were an “important contribution” to the welfare system but checks on how families spend their benefits were required. Swayne 63 then claimed that one in five children in Britain is “obese” by the time they leave primary school with those from the “lowest household incomes” being disproportionately affected.  The remarks have provoked anger online with many on Twitter suggesting that Swayne maybe should have taken a look around his own Tory benches before commenting. One person remarked: “Wow ... has he seen our PM? Not exactly the poster-boy for lean healthy living!” While another tweeted: “This is absolutely disgraceful.” Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner who is running to become the party’s next deputy leader hit out at the UK lawmaker. She insisted that the last thing poor people need is “finger wagging” and “derogatory insults” from a Tory MP. Another person seemingly frustrated by Swayne’s claims said: “Why do the rich always think they can tell the poor how to behave.”  Swayne caused controversy in October after a photo emerged of him ‘blacked up’ at a party when dressed as the legendary soul singer James Brown. He insisted that it was “fun” to do and refused to apologize maintaining that the only reason he wouldn’t do it again was because it was hard to wash off. Think your friends would be interested?

440,In the ongoing diplomatic spat London summoned Ambassador Hamid Baeidinejad in an apparent tit-for-tat move. UK envoy Rob Macaire was summoned to the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday over his “unconventional behavior.” “This was an unacceptable breach of the Vienna Convention and it needs to be investigated” the Foreign Office said on Monday. “We are seeking full assurances from the Iranian government that this will never happen again.” The scandal broke out after the brief detention of Macaire on Saturday during a vigil for victims of the Ukrainian plane downing which turned into a large protest. Iran’s deputy FM Seyed Abbas Araghchi said the detention came as a “big surprise” for him and that the envoy was released immediately after his identity was confirmed. The UK envoy however received objections from the Iranian authorities over his participation in the rally while local media reports indicate he was believed to have actually been directing the protesters. Macaire denied the allegations insisting that he was only seeking to attend the vigil to pay his respects to the victims of the Ukrainian jet tragedy and only spent a few minutes there.

The group was included in a guide titled: ‘Safeguarding Young People and Adults from Ideological Extremism.’ The document marked “official” was produced by counter-terrorism police. Patel’s comments drew an angry response from Labour leadership hopeful Rebecca Long-Bailey on Twitter who said the home secretary’s “defence of listing XR alongside neo-nazi terrorists is a disgrace.” XR staged mass demonstrations and a number of controversial stunts in London during April and October this year. In total around 3000 protesters were arrested. The group’s protests throughout autumn caused major travel disruptions in the UK capital. Public opinion towards the group soured when members staged a demonstration at a London Tube station climbing on top of train carriages until angry commuters pulled them back to the ground allowing services to resume.

444,Following the LHC ruling the ex-president is now a “free man” Ishtiaq A. Khan Additional Attorney General of Pakistan who represented the government in the case told AFP. The whole process against Musharraf – including the creation of a special court – was deemed to be void. LHC “has declared everything from the initiation of the complaint and its conclusion unconstitutional” Khan said as cited by Reuters. Earlier in the day Musharraf’s lawyer Azhar Siddique told the media outside the court that the judges have “nullified everything” against his client. Musharraf was sentenced to death in absentia on charges of high treason and undermining the constitution by the now-void special court in December last year. The verdict received a mixed reaction with Pakistan’s top military and government figures harshly criticizing the decision. A provision to hang Musharraf’s body in front of parliament for three days should he perish before the death sentence could be carried out was included in the verdict by one of the judges and sparked a backlash. It was branded “unprecedented and despicable” by Law Minister Farogh Naseem who called for the “mentally unfit” judge to be ousted. A controversial figure in Pakistan Musharraf was a general and army chief when he seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999. The accusations of treason against him date back to 2007 when he imposed a state of emergency as he sought reelection as president. Critics say Musharraf’s leadership was a setback for Pakistan. They accuse him of opening the country up to the CIA and its anti-terrorism program of targeted drone killings. They also believe he was linked to the assassination of his political opponent Benazir Bhutto in 2007. He has always firmly denied the allegation. His supporters however believe he is a true patriot who stood up to Islamist militants and staunchly defended Islamabad’s interests both at home and internationally.

445,The years-long chaos in Libya “didn’t give much room for optimism” so “a month or two ago no one had thought that the leaders of the two main warring factions would arrive in Moscow and sit down to negotiate” President of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vitaly Naumkin told RT. Fayez al-Sarraj the head of Libya’s Tripoli-based UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) and his rival the Libyan National Army (LNA) commander Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar arrived for peace talks in Moscow on Monday. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov are intermediaries in the discussions. Grigory Lukyanov a senior lecturer at the Moscow-based Higher School of Economics stressed that Russia’s unique role as “an independent neutral mediator” provides a chance to actually bring the conflicting parties together after all previous formats failed to do so. Haftar for one thing agreed to fly to Moscow because he does not consider Turkey an impartial side in the conflict Lukyanov told RT. The researcher noted that Russia’s primary goals are to end the bloodshed in Libya and lay the groundwork for further dialogue.   “The main task right now is to convince the parties that dialogue is better than war” he said adding that Turkey prefers a peace process to be created for Libya that would be similar to the existing Astana talks for Syria.    Naumkin agreed that a “lasting ceasefire” would be the most tangible result coming out of the talks. Libya has been devastated by war since 2011 when its longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed during a NATO-led bombing campaign. “NATO had never intended to bring democracy to Libya” Naumkin said. Remembering that the military bloc’s mission focused on getting rid of Gaddafi which ultimately led to the collapse of state institutions he added: “Democracy can never be introduced at the point of bayonets.” Lukyanov noted that it was “difficult to expect” that well-functioning democratic institutions could emerge after intervention from abroad. Russia warned about this back in 2011 and continues to do so today he said adding that the current “crisis was triggered by the ill-conceived destructive actions of the US and its allies such as France.” Think your friends would be interested?

448,The draft document suggests that all parties would stop military actions and observe the ceasefire conditions. Meanwhile a commission is to be established to determine a contact line between the warring sides. Russia and Turkey promised to support all sides in the conflict to help them implement the agreement. The talks in Moscow which involved the leaders of the major Libyan warring parties as well as foreign and defense ministers from both Russia and Turkey lasted for more than six hours and were mostly focused on detailing the terms of the ceasefire regime. Libya has been plunged into chaos for years after its longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed during a NATO-led bombing campaign. Following the years of devastation and chaos the country became engulfed in a civil war. Previous lengthy UN-backed talks on reconciliation which led to the establishment of the GNA eventually failed to bring peace to the war-ravaged land.   Haftar began an offensive against Tripoli last year and over the last few months the two sides were engaged in intense fighting. LNA controls most of Libya’s territory but it is the GNA which is recognized by the international community. Ankara became involved in the conflict in December promising to send troops to help the government in Tripoli as the international community called on all sides to enter negotiations.

449,The president claimed in tweets marred with misspellings that it does not matter if Soleimani presented an imminent threat to the US something he had said previously to defend the assassination because of the general’s “horrible past.” Trump also accused the media of trying to portray “terrorist Soleimani” as a “wonderful guy.” Though the president has claimed the January 3 assassination of Soleimani was due to the general planning attacks against US forces and embassies his own defense secretary admitted on Sunday that he “didn’t see” any specific evidence to suggest those attacks were imminent. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also struggled in a recent press conference to define the “imminent” threat Soleimani presented to the US. He claimed the US “got it right” with their decision to kill the general.  Huge crowds of Iranians took to the streets in the aftermath of the general’s death to protest the killing and his funeral drew an enormous procession. Tehran targeted military sites in Iraq housing US forces in retaliation for the assassination. No American casualties were reported in what was believed to be a show of force by the Iranian authorities.  Think your friends would be interested?

450,The Libyan National Army (LNA) and the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) have agreed upon some ceasefire details but they are still working on a document to elaborate upon some aspects of the ceasefire deal. Some warring parties signed the agreement immediately but General Khalifa Haftar the LNA commander wanted to wait until Tuesday morning to have more time to study the document. The talks in Moscow which involved the leaders of the major Libyan warring parties as well as foreign and defense ministers of both Russia and Turkey lasted for more than six hours and were mostly focused on detailing the terms of the ceasefire regime. The draft document suggests that the hostilities would stop and all parties would observe the ceasefire without any preconditions. A commission is also to be established to determine the contact line between the GNA and the LNA. Lavrov also made it clear that Russia and Turkey would further lend their support to all Libyan parties to help them implement the agreement reached in Moscow. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also expressed hope that both sides would eventually commit to complying with the newly-reached agreement paving the way for the start of political process in Libya. According to Lavrov the agreement was signed by Fayez al-Sarraj the head of the UN-backed Tripoli-based Government of National Accord and Khalid al-Mishri the head of the High Council of State an advisory body formed after the UN-backed 2015 talks which is technically able to advise both the GNA and the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR) aligned with Haftar’s LNA. Aguila Saleh the head of HoR did not sign the document. However Lavrov hopes the group will sign it on Tuesday. Both leaders “view this document positively and just want some extra time until tomorrow morning to make a final decision about signing it” the Russian minister told journalists. “I hope this decision will be positive” he added. Libya was devastated after its long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed during a NATO-led bombing campaign. The country was plunged into chaos in the years that followed and eventually centers of power emerged in Tripoli and Tobruk – engulfing the nation in another civil war. Previous UN-backed attempts to bring reconciliation to Libya eventually failed. Last year Haftar – whose forces controlled most of the war-ravaged country – began his offensive against the internationally recognized GNA. Turkey got involved in the conflict in December promising to send troops to aid GNA. Moscow and Ankara called for all parties in the Libyan civil war to end hostilities and join a ceasefire following a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul. The ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia and Turkey is seen as a huge breakthrough in the peace process for the war-torn country. A Libya summit is expected to take place in Berlin on Sunday.

451,Booker did not manage to capture any significant attention among Democratic voters in an already crowded race for the nomination consistently polling in the low single digits (an average of two percent nationally according to some data). He fell short of qualifying for a second consecutive televised debate due to take place Tuesday in Iowa.  “I got in this race to win and I’ve always said I wouldn’t continue if there was no longer a path to victory” Booker said in a statement to supporters adding that he couldn’t raise the funds required to continue while claiming that the “urgent business of impeachment” would keep him in Washington.   Booker’s campaign only managed to run $300000 of television ads in Iowa in the past two weeks which was unlikely to ever compete with the millions spent on advertising alone by his billionaire rivals for the nomination Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg. Booker will likely run for re-election to the Senate later this year. US President Donald Trump wasted no time skewering the former Democratic hopeful on Twitter with a scathing and sarcastic tweet. “Really Big Breaking News (Kidding): Booker who was in zero polling territory just dropped out of the Democrat Presidential Primary Race. Now I can rest easy tonight. I was sooo concerned that I would someday have to go head to head with him!” Think your friends would be interested?

452,“Democrats had better attack Sanders before it’s too late!” Monday’s Daily Beast headline may be hyperbole but it accurately expressed the mood of the party’s centrist establishment. Independent Vermont Senator Sanders is running for president as a Democrat and has promised to back the Democratic nominee should he fail to secure the top prize. But that’s cold comfort to the party elite who are beginning to worry after a poll published on Monday showed the unabashed leftist in first place in Iowa with less than a month to go before that state holds its influential caucus. Nor is that the only state Sanders appears poised to win. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren – who has tried to position her campaign as a more moderate pragmatic version of Sanders’ progressive platform – has charged to the party’s rescue latching onto a fundraising script allegedly used by the Sanders campaign that described her supporters as “highly educated more affluent people.” Portraying her constituents thus equates to “trashing her” she told reporters when confronted with the script on Sunday. Warren then went on to use it as the basis of a fundraising email pleading for “unity.” While Warren condemned Sanders for injecting “factionalism” into the contest statistics don’t lie – she is more popular among the “educated and rich” while Sanders enjoys more support among poorer voters and those without a college education. Only in the rarefied climate of the Democratic primary would “educated and rich” even be considered an insult - the fundraising email sent by a campaign staffer for Harvard professor Warren even insisted that the phrase “doesn’t describe me or many of the passionate volunteers and organizers I know.” But 2020 is not a normal election and after the ‘catastrophe’ of 2016 the Democrats are not a normal party. The centrist faction that triumphed over Sanders to run (and lose) with Hillary Clinton is locked in a battle with the leftist faction he represents – a mostly younger and scrappier group determined not to let ‘electability’ trump principles this time around. Sanders responded to Warren’s “disappointment” by claiming he’d never personally said anything negative against her explaining that with “hundreds of employees… people sometimes say things they shouldn’t.” A Sanders volunteer even hinted at a conspiracy to smear the campaign suggesting “anyone” could dump a negative script into the chat volunteers used. #ITrustBernie was trending on Monday as Sanders fans pledged their support after Warren's attack. Sanders’ ‘small-s’ socialism has won him enormous popular support. He broke Democratic fourth-quarter fundraising records earlier this month and has so far raised over $96 million in small donations eschewing the large corporate donors he has said he wants out of electoral politics altogether. His (in)famous claim that “billionaires should not exist” and plans to redistribute their wealth have ruffled some influential feathers in a party kept afloat by billionaires however and the establishment media has redoubled its own attacks as Sanders surges in the polls. The New York Times published a lengthy interview with the candidate on Monday framing the piece by reminding the reader of his recent heart attack and his support for leftist political movements “plagued” with “corruption and even violence.” Peppered throughout Sanders’ responses are links contradicting his claims even “fact-checking” his reference to having been interviewed by the Times before (“All but three members of the current editorial board joined after Mr. Sanders’s endorsement interview in 2015” it sniffs). The outlet hints that he is on the payroll of Big Vape (“campaign finance reports reveal that the Sanders campaign has accepted donations from Juul Labs employees”) attempts to frame his observation that exploitation of migrant workers drives wages down as anti-immigrant rhetoric and makes much of his unfamiliarity with social media and smartphone apps (because he’s old get it?!). But current polling puts Sanders ahead of Trump in an electoral face-off - only Biden can say the same and his numbers have been sliding so fast the political establishment has preemptively started blaming Russia. For once the Democratic Party may have to choose between the lesser of two evils.

453,"US President Donald Trump was impeached in the House of Representatives based on the narrative that he interfered in Ukrainian domestic affairs for personal political gain – but it was Biden himself who interfered while he was Barack Obama’s deputy according to ‘UkraineGate: Inconvenient Facts.’ The documentary was produced by French investigative journalist Olivier Berruyer founder of popular anti-corruption and economics blog Les Crises.  Biden publicly boasted about using US and international aid as leverage in 2015 to get prosecutor Viktor Shokin fired and replaced by Yuriy Lutsenko who was an interior minister in 2005-2006 but was later convicted by a Ukrainian court for corruption. After the 2014 Euromaidan coup the sentence was quashed. Those interviewed in Berruyer’s film describe Lutsenko as a “crook” who was “abusing his office” a man who “does not have any moral values and principles” and who had done “nothing” to fight corruption while in his post. ""Our investigation and its many powerful testimonies prove that Joe Biden lied brazenly and misled many people"" when he claimed Shokin's replacement was “someone solid” says Berruyer.

454,The Libyan National Army (LNA) and the UN-backed Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) have joined a ceasefire suggested by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as the leaders of the two warring factions arrived in Moscow for talks aimed at brokering a lasting truce. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov acted as intermediaries in negotiations between the LNA commander Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and the GNA head Fayez al-Sarraj. The negotiations ended with al-Sarraj and his allies signing the deal and Haftar asking for some time. The draft document suggests that the hostilities would stop and all parties would observe the ceasefire without any preconditions. A commission is also to be established to determine the contact line between the GNA force and the LNA. Even before the outcome of the talks was known the process received praise from some officials around the world. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the initiative of Russia and Turkey and praised the temporary truce as an important step but said that said that Libya needs a complex process of “consolidation” which according to her should be supervised by the UN. “A ceasefire yes it is a first step in the right direction but what you need is a process for consolidation for reconstruction and a government of unity. There is a long way to go. This has to be a UN-led process” she told reporters after a meeting with Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel. Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas also called the ceasefire “a positive signal” adding that his nation also plans to contribute to the political process in Libya by hosting a Libya summit later in January. “We currently have a good chance of making progress here” he said. African Union Commissioner for Peace and Security Smail Chergui emphasized Putin’s role in encouraging both warring parties to come to the negotiating table. “I welcome this step as well as the efforts taken by President Putin” he said adding that “signing a ceasefire agreement should be the first step to complying with the UN Security Council’s arms embargo and putting an end to any outside interference into Libya.” Libya was plunged into chaos for years after its longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed during a NATO-led bombing campaign. Following years of devastation and chaos the country got engulfed in a civil war. Previous lengthy UN-backed talks on reconciliation which led to the establishment of the GNA failed to bring peace to the war-ravaged land. Like this story?

455,Indian film actor director and producer Ajay Devgn’s ‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior’ and Indian superstar actress and producer Deepika Padukone’s ‘Splash’ are very different movies in ways that extend far beyond storyline or budget. They appear to have divided audiences along ideological lines ever since they hit cinemas together on January 10. The intense rivalry over the two films can be gauged by the fact that workers for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party are distributing free tickets for ‘Tanhaji’ – based on the legend of a Hindu warrior from the medieval era – in many places while Congressmen members of the main opposition party in India are doing so for ‘Splash’ a biopic about acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal. Several BJP leaders have called for a boycott of ‘Splash’ but in the Congress-ruled states of Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan the movie has been declared tax-free in a bid to boost its prospects. Box-office figures for the two movies have only served to further intensify their fight. ‘Tanhaji’ has been met with a tremendous response bringing in Rs 61.75 crore (US$8.7 million) at ticket windows over its opening weekend; in contrast takings for ‘Splash’ were much lower totaling Rs 19.02 crore ($US2.6 million) in the same period. It may not be a battle of equals. ‘Tanhaji’ is an extravagant period drama depicting the exploits of Tanaji Malusare a 17th-century Maratha military leader from Maharashtra who took on the mighty Mughals during the reign of Muslim emperor Aurangzeb. ‘Splash’ on the other hand is a low-budget film tackling the rampant issue of acid attacks on girls across India which seeks to deliver a strong social message. Despite their vast differences the two movies are locked in an epic clash – primarily because of Padukone’s visit to Jawaharlal Nehru University two days before the release of her movie apparently to express solidarity with agitating students who had earlier been beaten by the police. The university campus has long been a hotbed of left-wing politics with students having protested for quite some time against the policies of the Modi government including the recent amendment to the citizenship laws and the hikes in various university fees. Padukone’s visit therefore raised the hackles of Modi supporters who not only accused the 34-year-old actress of resorting to a cheap publicity stunt to boost her film’s prospects but also called for its boycott due to her support for the allegedly divisive elements on the JNU campus. Unsurprisingly the actress was on the receiving end of their barbs once it became clear on Monday that her film had fared poorly compared to ‘Tanhaji’. Padukone’s baiters claim that audiences have summarily rejected her film while extending wholehearted support to ‘Tanhaji’ because the Devgn-starrer containing themes of nationalism reflects the overall national mood against divisive forces in the country. They also construe its success as a validation of the Modi government’s policies underpinned by a sense of national pride and patriotism. “It is no longer #Tanhaji vs #Chhapaak (‘Splash’ - RT.) at the BO it’s about those For India vs Against India. I hope the message is loud and clear” tweeted Gunjan Mehta apparently a supporter of the government. Others dubbed ‘Splash’ a commercial disaster claiming only three people had gone to watch it in a theatre in the eastern city of Patna on the day of release. Film analysts believe that the success of ‘Tanhaji’ which is set to be the first movie of the year to net Rs 100 crore ($US14 million) – a benchmark for any blockbuster in India – points to a growing preference among audiences for nationalistic films. They cite the massive success of 2018’s ‘Uri’ starring Vicky Kaushal which was based on India’s surgical strikes on the terror camps of Balakot in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in 2016. ‘Tanhaji’ director Om Raut also feels that the general atmosphere in the country today is one of pride and patriotism. ”The environment is of a very strong feeling of being an Indian of patriotism” he says. “The entire environment is such. Cinema and filmmakers are only a reflection and part of society.” Nonetheless ‘Splash’ has not turned out to be a damp squib after all. Trade experts say that although it may have done less business than ‘Tanhaji’ it is a smaller movie by comparison. ‘Splash’ has been made on a tight budget they note with both Padukone and director Meghna Gulzar also adopting the role of co-producers. Since it does not contain any big stars other than Padukone herself it is likely not only to recover its costs but also to make a profit towards the end of its first week in cinemas. It is altogether a different matter that ‘Tanhaji’ a veritable ode to Hindu valor and pride will have become a blockbuster by then – and that will be a cause for celebration for Modi supporters in and outside of the Indian film industry.

456,The shooting was an “act of terror” that was “motivated by jihadist ideology” Barr told reporters on Monday at a press conference adding that Alshamrani is believed to have acted alone. Alshamrani visited the 9/11 memorial during the Thanksgiving holiday after posting a cryptic message on September 11 stating that the “countdown” had begun Barr revealed. Following an exhaustive investigation the US will return 21 Saudi military students to their home country later on Monday. After the probe turned up “derogatory material” on the 21 cadets’ computers in addition to “jihadi or anti-American content” on 17 of them and “some kind of contact with child pornography” on 15 the Saudi government “determined that this material demonstrated conduct unbecoming an officer in the Royal Saudi Air Force and in the Royal Navy.” However none of the material would result in criminal prosecution on its own under US law Barr clarified. Barr praised the actions of two US Marines who attempted to stop Alshamrani as well as a navy airman shot five times by the gunman who helped others escape the hail of bullets and the Saudi government which gave “complete and total support” to the investigation. While Alshamrani was not inspired by or working with any particular group his social media posts showed he harbored “anti-US military and anti-Israel sentiment” and believed “violence was necessary to defend Muslim countries” deputy FBI director David Bowdich told reporters. Some of his statements echoed those of Anwar al-Awlaki an American cleric killed in a drone strike in Yemen he added. Barr took time to excoriate Apple for refusing to unlock the shooter’s phones despite a court order returning to an anti-encryption theme that has frequently surfaced in the AG’s public statements. Alshamrani a second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force killed three people and wounded eight at the naval base before he was himself killed in a shootout with Escambia County Sheriff’s deputies on December 6. Barr dispelled early reports that Alshamrani had arrived at the base with colleagues who filmed the violence. The US trains Saudi military students on American soil with some 850 personnel reported to be in the country when the Pensacola shooting resulted in a temporary suspension of their military training. The tragedy has elicited a call for stricter vetting of all foreign military personnel who receive permission to train in the US from Pentagon chief Mark Esper. Like this story?

457,"      Little Women: This drama follows the story of four women dealing with life during the Civil War.  Nominations: Six including including Best Actress (Saoirse Ronan) and Best Supporting Actress (Florence Pugh). Good or woke: The film has earned some backlash for containing uncharacteristically modern liberal speeches. The moments include characters being ashamed of America and explaining why marriage is bad for women. The speeches are sprinkled throughout the movie and make the proceedings feel odd and disjointed. It’s yet another Hollywood feature that suffers from too much focus on modern agendas and not enough focus on story. Though the film was nominated for Best Picture and several other awards producer Amy Pascal has said men’s “unconscious bias” has led to awards snubs at several ceremonies.  Rating: Woke The Irishman: Martin Scorsese’s film joined the talents of Robert De Niro Al Pacino and Joe Pesci – all staples of gangster cinema classics – for the first time. It follows the story of Jimmy Hoffa’s (Pacino) – an uncharacteristically popular labor union leader with mob connections who mysteriously disappeared in 1975 – rise and fall through the eyes of a gangster and pal (De Niro). Nominations: Nine including Best Picture Director and Supporting Actor (both Pacino and Pesci).  Good or woke: The de-aging of the actors was atrocious and an actual story doesn’t really kick in until the film’s last hour or so. Producers behind the movie tried to win over politically correct social media mobs before the flick’s release by talking up the story’s supposed takedown of “toxic masculinity."" It’s easy to see how the makers filtered this move through a “toxic masculinity” lens. They seem so afraid to give any energy to their characters. While Scorsese’s ‘Goodfellas’ and ‘Casino’ were fun and vibrant ‘The Irishman’ ended up being a tepid and lifeless look at gangster life and all it has to offer. Rating: Woke Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: An aging actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stuntman (Brad Pitt) attempt a comeback in the movie business in 1969 Los Angeles.  Nominations: Nine including Best Picture Director Actor (DiCaprio) and Supporting Actor (Pitt) Good or woke: ‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’ got away with quite a lot for being released in 2019. The film included extreme violence Brad Pitt beating up hippies and plenty of right-leaning talking points from its main characters. It got away with so much because the new strategy for being politically incorrect without angering anyone is simply setting your story in the past. That way you can hide behind excuses like “it was a different time” or “of course these characters are mean but they didn’t know any better.” Past or no past we should still be grateful a movie as unforgivably free-wheeling in its dialogue and action like this was released in a year where wokeness in movies was dialed up to 11. Rating: Good especially when Pitt beats up those hippies Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The concluding chapter to the rebooted saga based on George Lucas’ original films. Nominations: Three including Best Visual Effects and Original Score. Good or woke: From the Mary Sue main character in Rey to the lame “hate the rich” speeches in ‘Last Jedi’ to the overall muddy storytelling that makes Lucas’s prequel trilogy look like a masterpiece we should all be grateful this trilogy has come to a conclusion.  Yes it’s more diverse than the other ‘Star Wars’ chapters but that does not suddenly make this good storytelling.  Rating: The wokest of the woke Parasite: An unemployed family takes various jobs working for a wealthy family who may have a few twisted secrets.  Nominations: Eight including Best Picture and Director.  Good or woke: ‘Parasite’ is an incredibly well-made film. It’s beautifully shot and expertly builds tension until its final moments – but it’s also woke woke woke.  The film’s intention in contrasting the families is clear from the beginning. One scene even shows how the two families deal with the same rain storm. The rich family look out their window and simply enjoys a rainy night in their cozy abode while the poor family who quite literally live miles below fight for their lives as they battle incoming water.  Rating: Super woke but super good 1917: Two British soldiers in World War I are tasked with moving through enemy lines to warn 1600 soldiers that they are walking into a trap. Nominations: Eight including Best Picture and Director Good or woke: ‘1917’ was this year’s gimmick movie but luckily the gimmick worked. The World War I feature was filmed to look as though everything happens in one take and it really adds to the rising tension of the film. The Sam Mendes-directed movie spends so much time wrapped up in telling its story that it doesn’t have a whole lot of time to push an agenda. Just pure filmmaking here. Rating: Good Bombshell: Three blonde “bombshells” (Charlize Theron Margot Robbie Naomie Watts) work at Fox News and face sexual harassment at the hands of the late Roger Ailes (John Lithgow). Nominations: Three including Best Actress (Theron) and Supporting Actress (Robbie). Good or woke: It’s a story worth telling considering Ailes had some very real and harsh accusations lodged against him toward the end of his life but told through the filter of liberal Hollywood ‘Bombshell’ is an insufferably one-sided affair. According to this flick Fox News is the only place where these sorts of things were happening which anyone with an internet connection knows is far far from the truth. It also goes out of its way to make its main characters including former Fox News host Megyn Kelly (Theron) look bad. It’s afraid to humanize conservative women. Rating: Woke Ford v Ferrari: Matt Damon and Christian Bale star as Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles two racing legends tasked with helping Ford take the Le Mans racing title from Ferrari. Nominations: Four including Best Picture and Editing. Good or woke: It was a bit of a shock to see ‘Ford v Ferrari’ earn a Best Picture nomination considering how little the film caters to modern cultural standards. The James Mangold-directed feature looks lovingly at men and ambition two things almost never shown in a good light in modern Hollywood. It’s an old school tale of hard work passion and competition bringing out the very best in men who dedicate their lives to doing what they love.  Rating: Good Marriage Story: This film quite simply tells the tale of a married couple (Scarlet Johansson and Adam Driver) going through the painful process of a divorce.  Nominations: Six including Best Actress (Johansson) and Actor (Driver). Good or woke: One could say Noah Baumbach’s ‘Marriage Story’ is a socially liberal anti-marriage film since it’s such a cynical and uncomfortable look at every step of a marriage falling apart but there’s really no agenda here besides giving an honest and uncomfortably real look at a relationship devolving. Rating: Good Jojo Rabbit: The satirical film follows the story of a young Nazi boy who worships Hitler but finds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl. Nominations: Six including Best Picture and Supporting Actress (Johansson) Good or woke: ‘Jojo Rabbit’ remains one of the most surprising movies of the year. At a time when people especially conservatives are accused of being “Nazis” on a daily basis it seemed unlikely that Hollywood would turn its attention to a Nazi comedy but that’s exactly what they did. What commences may make some uncomfortable but it is also surprisingly charming. Rating: Good Joker: This was the movie the mainstream media warned us would cause violence and panic in the streets. Todd Phillips’ slowburn look inside the mind of a man losing a grip with sanity ended up causing nothing but people to actually go to cinemas. The Popeye’s chicken sandwich inspired more violence than this flick. Nominations: 11 including Best Picture Director and Actor (Joaquin Phoenix). Good or woke: Despite tackling serious subjects like mental health and class division the film managed to not be a preachy diatribe. It was an actual story with a nuanced lead character and a layered message that doesn’t fully align with any political party.  ‘Joker’ may have been the hit the media and woke crowds didn’t want but people came out in droves for this flick. The $60 million film made a colossal billion dollars at the box office and is sure to change the landscape of comic book movies for years to come.  Any movie that can get praises from both Glenn Beck and Michael Moore can’t be all bad right? Rating: Not just good but great Zachary Leeman author of the novel Nigh and journalist who covers art and culture. ", https://www.rt.com/usa/478164-oscar-nominations-woke-good/,None
458,Fayez al-Sarraj who heads the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli and Khalifa Haftar who commands the rival Libyan National Army (LNA) forces spent six hours in closed-door discussions mediated by Russia and Turkey. The meeting came as a bit of a surprise as Haftar previously snubbed the ceasefire suggested by Moscow and Ankara. By Monday evening Moscow time a draft agreement between Haftar and al-Sarraj said that both sides supported an “unconditional open-ended” ceasefire but only GNA representatives signed the deal while Haftar asked to have till Tuesday morning to consider the agreement which also called for a “military commission to determine a contact line” between the warring parties. Russian media reported that while the two men were in the same building al-Sarraj refused to engage in direct talks with Haftar.  While unsurprisingly no major breakthrough was made Monday the Moscow talks were an important step and were intended to pave the way for another summit to be held in Berlin later this month. A spokesperson for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday that the planned Berlin talks would be the start of a “longer process.” The Libya sit-down came as something of a surprise to many. “Few – particularly in Europe – saw this coming” tweeted Libya researcher and journalist Mary Fitzgerald. With Haftar's LNA looking poised to close in on Tripoli the situation in Libya had been left to fester and looked to be at a point of major escalation before the Russian and Turkish intervention. Russia was in the optimal position to host the talks Grigory Lukyanov a senior lecturer at the Moscow-based Higher School of Economics told RT. That is because Russia is “the only player today that has the trust” of both major factions in Libya as well as of Turkey and Egypt which back opposing sides in the conflict. Of course the big question now is whether any ceasefire can remain in place after the Moscow and Berlin talks Mark Almonddirector of the Crisis Research Institute Oxford (CRIOx) UK told RT. But even if the current fighting lines are frozen that “at least gives time and possibilities for further discussions.” It is unlikely that Haftar would travel to Moscow if he was unwilling to sign an agreement but he will have to ensure that all sub-groups and militias within the LNA are on board with the ceasefire Almond said. Libya has been in a state of chaos since NATO’s military operation nine years ago plunged the country into civil war and opened up a power vacuum which various warring factions have attempted to fill. Having created the crisis in the first place the West then stepped away from efforts to solve it and quarrelled with each other over the best approach. The European Union itself does not have one unified position on Libya. Italy was once seen as a major influence in Libya and now increasingly seen as less relevant to talks. French President Emmanuel Macron told Putin in a call on Monday that he would support any ceasefire that was “credible durable and verifiable.” “Now [Russia and Turkey] not only have their seat at the table they provide the table. And Europe is nowhere to be seen” tweeted Der Spiegel journalist Mathieu von Rohr. European and Arab powers “scrambled to catch up” as Putin used “the levers of diplomacy” to take the lead on Libya the Independent wrote.  The decision by Russia and Turkey to take the lead on Libya can be compared with how the pair also stepped up to take control of political negotiations in the Syrian conflict. Russia’s proactive role in Syria sparked a frenzy in the West with the media raising the alarm about Russian influence in the region and even portraying Russia’s efforts as sinister. Yet the results can sometimes speak for themselves. Al-Sarraj and Haftar’s willingness to travel to Moscow to begin fresh talks – something that a month ago seemed unimaginable – indicates that even the most complicated and multi-layered conflicts could be solved through diplomatic means rather than through threats and arm-twisting.

459,Grisham says Democrats are “taking the side of terrorists” and that was the point Trump was trying to make when he retweeted an image of Pelosi and Schumer photshopped with Muslim garb on in front of an Iranian flag. Fox News host Harris Faulker confronted Grisham about the tweet on Monday and even read a response that called the photoshopped image a “slur.” “Why the actual hell is the president of the United States using the way I and millions of other Americans dress and the religious beliefs that We hold as a slur. This absolutely must be condemned by congressional lawmakers on both sides of the aisle” read the tweet brought up by Faulkner which was originally posted by Libyan-American writer and commentator Hend Amry. “Why would the president take even the time to retweet something like this?” Faulker asked Grisham.  The press secretary went into a long-winded defense about the “point” the president was trying to make with the rather silly retweet. “I think the president is making clear that the Democrats have been parroting Iranian talking points and almost taking the side of terrorists and those who are out to kill the Americans” she said. “I think the president was making a point that the Democrats seem to hate him so much that they are willing to be on the side of countries and leadership of countries who want to kill Americans.” Grisham’s defense sparked almost as much outrage as the actual tweet from Trump with some going so far as to bring up Grisham’s criminal history and the fact that she has not held press briefings while she has been with the administration.  Like this story?

460,Bar associations in cities all over France have staged theatrical demonstrations to draw the public’s attention to the longest general strike in decades which has been underway since December 5. Videos posted on social media show the lawyers tossing off their robes carrying a “coffin of justice” spelling out “SOS” with law books and singing protest songs as they demand a retraction of the new pension system Macron’s government recently unveiled. The strike has disrupted some major trials including that of former priest Bernard Preynat - the worst clergy abuse case to reach French courts so far. Preynat is accused of sexually abusing 75 Boy Scouts; while he admitted to the abuse in the 1990s he was only defrocked in July after his superiors covered up for him. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted but the case is on hold due to the strike. The lawyers are just one of many professional groups that have stopped work to protest the proposed “one-size-fits-all” pension scheme. Under the current system different professions retire at different ages and receive different benefits complications Macron has complained is unfair and too expensive. As the strike edged into its sixth week the government offered to withdraw the most controversial proposal - raising the retirement age two years from 62 to 64 - but not all unions took the offer.  The general strike is the longest one for transit workers since the creation of France’s national rail service.Nurses teachers refinery workers and port workers have joined also in their opposition to the government. The Yellow Vests still protesting after more than a year have joined the strikers in solidarity at marches in the cities with the past weekend’s march reportedly drawing over 1.3 million across the country. The Yellow Vest protests were initially sparked by another of Macron’s austerity reforms a gas tax that was ultimately rescinded in the face of massive public opposition.  Like this story?

461,Actress Issa Rae who was helping to announce the Oscar nominations took a dig at the recognition of the nominees by saying after their names were announced: “congratulations to those men.”  There's little doubt that Quentin Tarantino Todd Phillips Martin Scorsese Bong Joon-ho and Sam Mendes created good films. But it was an especially odd year for no females to be nominated for the Best Director Award since there were so many critically acclaimed films directed by female artists including ‘Little Women’ from Greta Gerwig. Gerwig was arguably the biggest snub since her film earned nominations for Best Picture Best Adapted Screenplay Best Actress (Soairse Ronan) Best Supporting Actress (Florence Pugh) Best Original Score and Best Costume Design. With that many nominations it was a bit of a surprise to see Gerwig’s name not pop up as a nominee. Other women directors seen as snubbed include Lorene Scafaria for ‘Hustlers’ and Merielle Heller for ‘A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood’ a film which earned a Best Actor nomination for Tom Hanks. Kathryn Bigelow remains the only woman to win a Best Director Oscar in the 92 year history of the Academy Awards something some critics were quick to point out in light of the new nominees.  Bigelow won the award for 2009’s ‘The Hurt Locker.’ To make matters worse only five women total have been nominated in the Best Director category. Whether the male nominees were actually more worthy of their nominations than the acclaimed female directors of the year is also up for debate. Martin Scorsese was nominated for a movie — ‘The Irishman’ — that has special effects outshined by a YouTuber using free software and ‘Joker’ director Todd Phillips is earning plenty of criticism for being nominated for a film that is essentially one long homage to the work of Scorsese.  But still the choices seemed puzzling in the light of Hollywood's self-promoted woke image making the Academy Awards a prime example of why diverse industry is nothing but a mirage.  If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/478170-oscar-nominations-female-snubs/,None
462,"The Treasury said in a statement that China agreed to publish relevant data on exchange rates and made an effort to refrain from ""competitive devaluation"" ahead of the agreement signing. In its semi-annual report released on Monday the Treasury said that while China “took concrete steps to devalue its currency” Beijing still needs “to take the necessary steps to avoid a persistently weak currency.”  The report explicitly credits the tentative phase one trade agreement between the US and China struck in December for helping to bring about the reforms. The report also notes an “extremely large and persistent trade surplus” Beijing enjoys with the US which it said is “dwarfing all other trade imbalances” between the US and other countries. The Treasury urged China to boost domestic demand and lessen its economy's reliance on export and investment apparently to reduce the trade gap. The US goods trade deficit with China stood at $401 billion as of June 2019 which accounts for about 45 percent of the total US trade deficit from January to June of last year the report states. While the Trump administration struck China off the roll of currency manipulators it has placed Beijing along with nine other countries on the Treasury’s ‘Monitoring List’ of major trading partners that “merit close attention to their currency practices.” The list includes staunch US allies such as Germany Korea and Japan. The move to yank China off the blacklist comes more than five months after it was formally designated a currency manipulator in August a decision that added more fuel to the smoldering tensions between Beijing and Washington which are locked in a bitter trade dispute. It comes just two days ahead of the much-anticipated signing of the phase one deal on Wednesday January 15 which is expected to mark a shaky truce after almost two years of a trade war in which China and the US have slapped tariffs on billions’ worth of each other’s goods.  Think your friends would be interested?

463,The case was filed with the US District Court in Massachusetts on Monday by Lawrence Lessig – a policy activist and founder of the Creative Commons project – who says the Times used a “clickbait” headline to misinform readers in an article published in September which led him to be unfairly “associated with the notoriety surrounding the Epstein scandal.” The paper’s actions “are part of a growing journalistic culture of clickbaiting: the use of a shocking headline... to entice readers to click on a particular article irrespective of the truth of the headline” Lessig’s lawsuit reads. The story in question is centered on an essay Lessig wrote in defense of Joi Ito the former director of MIT’s Media Lab who resigned in disgrace after it was discovered he had accepted and then covered up donations to MIT from Jeffrey Epstein. Lessig’s essay made the case that MIT had the right to keep its donors private and argued that while Ito made many mistakes he nonetheless tried to “to determine whether Epstein remained an abuser.” In covering the essay however the Times headlined its story: “A Harvard Professor Doubles Down: If You Take Epstein’s Money Do It in Secret” adding in its first paragraph that Lessig was defending “soliciting donations from the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.” The story alleges “the exact opposite of what Lessig had written” and was printed even after he brought his concerns to the newspaper pre-publication the lawsuit says. “My essay said – repeatedly – that such soliciting was a 'mistake'” Lessig wrote in a blog post on Monday discussing the suit adding “I did not defend taking money from Epstein. I didn’t say it was ok to take money from Epstein ‘if in secret.’” A spokesperson for the Times said the newspaper will “defend against the claim vigorously” in a statement to the Hill adding senior editors reviewed Lessig’s complaints and were “satisfied that the story accurately reflected his statements.” Like this story?

464,“Our principled position is clear-cut. We are against unilateral sanctions and the so-called ‘long-arm jurisdiction’” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said in a press briefing on Monday responding to a round of sanctions recently imposed on Iran’s metal exports sector three Chinese companies and a number of senior Iranian officials. Geng also urged the US to resolve differences “through dialogue” and in compliance with the UN Charter instead of through threats and ultimatums and said Washington must take “concrete steps” to ratchet down tensions with Iran. The new round of sanctions came days after Iran carried out missile strikes on US bases in Iraq launched in reprisal for the killing of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani who was assassinated by an American drone near Baghdad International Airport on January 3. Appearing on Fox News on Monday US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said American sanctions had so far cut off “over 95 percent of [Iran’s] oil revenues” adding that Beijing could face sanctions if it doesn’t halt its own petrol purchases from the Islamic Republic. While Beijing steadily decreased its oil purchases from Iran over 2019 it continues to be the top importer of Iranian crude and recently stepped up efforts to develop Iran’s energy resources as part of a “strategic partnership” deal signed last year namely by helping to boost output at the massive Azadegan oil field near the Iraqi border.

465,The US has upped the rhetorical ante on its largely unfounded claims that Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei will severely compromise a country’s cyber security if it is allowed to work on any of the world’s burgeoning national 5G networks. A team of high-ranking US officials including those from the National Security Agency (NSA) were set to present supposedly damning evidence to the UK government on Monday arguing the equipment supplied by the Chinese company may come with hidden ‘backdoors’ granting Beijing access to critical British infrastructure. In the wake of the meeting with the British ministers the Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh quoted US officials as saying that using Huawei technology for 5G in the UK would be “an act of madness.” It’s unclear exactly what proof the US officials presented to their British colleagues as several major US allies such as Germany and India have so far found no compelling reason to ban Huawei from their own 5G networks. Washington has long tried to persuade London into shunning the Chinese tech giant. In December US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien argued that once Huawei is given a green light in the UK Beijing would “steal wholesale state secrets whether they are the UK’s nuclear secrets or secrets from MI6 or MI5.”  Such an ominous prediction apparently did not strike a chord with the British intelligence community itself however with head of MI5 Andrew Parker telling the Financial Times in a recent interview that he had “no reason to think” the intelligence sharing agreement between the UK and the US would be in any danger if the British government refused to shut the door on Huawei.  Huawei has denied that it is in bed with the Chinese government and that its products can be used for spying in turn warning the UK that by caving in to American pressure it may see its own technological development fall behind on a “fabricated pretext.”  The UK is expected to make a formal decision on whether to allow Huawei to be a part of its next-generation networks later this month.

466,Barr told reporters on Monday that Apple had not “given any substantive assistance” to law enforcement agencies looking to crack into a pair of smartphones owned by the shooter – who left four people dead on a Florida naval base in December – but the company directly countered the AG in a statement. “We reject the characterization that Apple has not provided substantive assistance in the Pensacola investigation” the tech giant said adding that it had responded to the FBI’s requests for help “promptly often within hours.” Apple previously went head-to-head with the FBI in a lengthy legal battle over a similar phone-cracking case related to the 2016 terrorist attack in San Bernardino in which the company refused to provide the bureau a backdoor into one of the attacker’s phones. Though Apple still maintains “there is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys” the company has become more willing to engage with law enforcement in recent years announcing in 2018 that it would create a special police “portal” allowing officers to request data. Despite its attitude on encryption the company’s devices have also been found to contain inadvertent backdoors of a sort with fears of spying triggered last year after a curious microphone glitch popped up allowing callers to hear recipients speak before they answered the phone. Last August it was also revealed that company contractors were granted access to customers’ private conversations through Siri the AI assistant program a practice Apple says it has since ended. The company turned heads more recently when it confirmed that it scans all images stored in its cloud service for evidence of “child abuse” prompting some critics to slam the company for violating user privacy.

467,The world’s second richest person Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos should not count on a red carpet welcome in India when he arrives in New Delhi later this week with mass rallies and sit-ins being planned by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) protesting what it calls “predatory” trade practices. The CAIT which represents 70 million small traders and businesses has called on its supporters to go on strike on Wednesday when Bezos is set to touch down. The group argues that retail giants such as Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart have been engaging in predatory dumping pushing local merchants out of business. The CAIT accused Amazon of trying to spin its vulture capitalism as something that can empower small traders while peddling “a wrong and false narrative.” Branding both US-based companies “economic terrorists” that prey on India’s small businesses the CAIT asked for a meeting with PM Narendra Modi amid reports that Bezos has sought one himself. The association said its biggest rally would be held in front of Amazon India’s offices in Delhi where Bezos is set to attend an event for small and medium-sized businesses. Since late November supporters of CAIT and other trade organizations have hit the streets to voice their outrage over the two e-commerce giants’ alleged violation of competition laws. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) announced on Monday that it had opened an investigation into the alleged violations by both Amazon and Flipkart noting that “there exists a prima facie case which requires an investigation.” The complaint which spurred the probe alleges that the two companies promoted several “preferred sellers” that were in effect controlled by Amazon and Flipkart themselves. The CCI order also noted that the retailers have offered huge discounts and have played favorites with listings by particular sellers among other things. “Exclusive launch (of mobile phones) coupled with preferential treatment to a few sellers and the discounting practices create an ecosystem that may lead to an appreciable adverse effect on competition” said the 11-page order cited by Reuters. The CAIT hailed the decision to launch a probe calling it “historic.” Flipkart has brushed off the allegations while Amazon said it would “welcome” the opportunity to respond to the claims maintaining that it is “confident” it is not in the wrong.

468,Remarkable footage of the incident surfaced on social media showing the moment the ground gave way beneath the bus as it stopped to pick up passengers in the city of Xining sending it head-first into a large hole. At least one explosion can be seen inside the hole moments later. Rescue teams are now searching for the 10 passengers still missing and the cause of the accident is still under investigation according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. While uncommon sinkholes occur from time to time in China with one 60-meter hole opening up in Guyuan last September devouring a taxi cab whole. Fortunately unlike the recent case in Xining there were no casualties. Like this story? Share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/news/478183-china-sinkhole-kills-six/,None
469,Specialists were called to the scene in Odisha after receiving reports that a python was trapped inside a pipe.

470,Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says the US is to blame for flaming tensions in the Persian Gulf adding that killing of a top Iranian general went beyond all legal frameworks. Threat or no threat - the US president defends the assassination of a top Iranian general because of his checkered past - with no apparent evidence of him being an imminent danger to the US. Also in the US 21 Saudi military members are expelled from training facilities in America - for possessing jihadist and indecent material.
