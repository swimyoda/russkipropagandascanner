0,Celebrities react to Trump and Biden's dual town halls," At least 44 schools in San Francisco could see their names changed as officials believe some were named after those with potential connections to slavery genocide and colonization according to a report on Thursday. The San Francisco School Names Advisory Committee researched school names and identified certain ones for renaming. Some Principals and parents questioned the wisdom of devoting energy on this issue when so many children continue to take remote lessons. Jonathan Alloy whose children attend one of the schools on the list criticized the timing. He said kids are already forced to conduct distance learning which negatively impacts minorities more so than their peers according to the San Francisco Chronicle.  LARA LOGAN VISITS NANCY PELOSI'S SAN FRANCISCO MANSION IN 'THE SOCIALIST INVASION' “Principals are devoting resources to this"" he said. “We’re not actually helping disadvantaged children by changing the name of the school they can’t attend."" The move comes during a year that has seen statues and monuments of historical figures toppled throughout the U.S. amid a call against racial injustice following the death of George Floyd in police custody back in May. According to the paper certain criteria by the committee included: ""Anyone directly involved in the colonization of people those connected to any human rights or environmental abuses slave owners or participants in enslavement and known racists and/or white supremacists and/or espoused racist beliefs."" Some of the schools listed under the proposed name changes included Abraham Lincoln High School George Washington High School Roosevelt Middle School and Jefferson Elementary. The committee's recommendation which is heading to the school board said the names of Lincoln Washington and Jefferson that have connections to connections to slavery genocide or oppression must be changed. Included was a recommendation to change the name of Dianne Feinstein Elementary which honors the current U.S. Senator and former mayor of San Francisco because she reportedly replaced a vandalized Confederate flag back in 1986. Panelist Mariposa Villaluna requested that the committee also include Thomas Edison Elementary School on the list because of his treatment toward animals.  SAN FRANCISCO TAX REVENUE PLUNGE POINTS TO RESIDENT EXODUS “He euthanized them without scientific research” she said during a September meeting according to the SF Chronicle. “It wasn’t like hamsters in a cage you know what I mean.” The school board will likely conduct a late Jan or early Feb vote on the recommended name changes but each school on the list is expected to decide upon an alternative name change by Dec. 18. Board President Mark Sanchez said that the 44 schools on the list are requested to come up with new names even with the struggles of students and staff during the pandemic. “I don’t think there is ever going to be a time when people are ready for this” he said according to the paper. “Predictably people are going to be upset no matter when we do this.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sanchez doesn't anticipate all will be changed although he said the schools should be prepared to do so.

2,John Legend pens Chrissy Teigen loving note after pregnancy loss: 'I love and cherish you'," Marcell Ozuna and the Atlanta Braves turned things around in a hurry and now are one win from ending a two-decade World Series drought. Ozuna homered twice rookie right-hander Bryse Wilson made his postseason debut by outpitching a three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw and the Braves bounced back from a lopsided loss with a rout of their own beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 10-2 on Thursday night. “Feels good feels really good” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “Still have a lot of work to do you know how quick things can turn. I was really proud of the guys how they bounced back.”CORREA HITS WALKOFF HOMER TO KEEP ASTROS ALIVE IN ALCS The Braves took a 3-1 lead in the NL Championship Series a night after a 15-3 loss. Atlanta will try to reach its first World Series since 1999 when it plays Game 5 Friday night. Atlanta became the first team in MLB history to have back-to-back games in a single postseason where they lost by at least eight runs and then won by at least eight runs according to STATS. Dustin May the 23-year-old Texan who has thrown 4 2-3 scoreless innings in three appearances this postseason will start for the Dodgers with them facing potential elimination. Atlanta will likely go with a bullpen day. Ozuna had four hits and drove in four runs. It was 1-all in the sixth when the Braves scored six times with MVP candidate Freddie Freeman hitting a tiebreaking double and Ozuna following with an RBI double that chased Kershaw. A night after the Dodgers had a record 11-run first they managed only one hit — a solo homer by Edwin Ríos — over six innings against the 22-year-old Wilson. “He was in complete control. ... He had a really good look about him. He had good tempo and the stuff was live” Snitker said. “It was huge a huge effort by him.” Ronald Acuña Jr. led off the decisive six-run sixth with an infield single on a play that ended with him Kershaw and second baseman Kiké Hernández all on the ground. They all took tumbles because of their effort and weren't knocked down by the sometimes bothersome breezy conditions in the new Texas ballpark with the roof open. Kershaw fell down after coming off the mound while reaching up to try to field the high chopper. Hernández went to the ground after grabbing the ball and making a sidearm throw then went wide while Acuña tumbled after passing the base and landed awkwardly on his left wrist that was irritated twice during the regular season. Acuña went to second base because of the errant throw after being tended to for several moments. After trying glasses in the field and getting eyedrops early in the game Freeman apparently had no problems seeing when he doubled home Acuña for a 2-1 lead before Ozuna followed with another double. Reliever Brusdar Graterol got the first out before giving up three consecutive hits including Dansby Swanson's two-run double and Austin Riley's RBI single. Rookie Cristian Pache capped the inning with an RBI single that made it 7-1. “They’re similar to us as far as they build on momentum really well” Kershaw said. “It just seems like they have that domino effect when one thing gets going. They just continue to build on that. And they’ve got great hitters too.” Freeman and Ozuna each added RBI singles in the eighth. “We have fun today” Ozuna said. “Yesterday before we start we were on a little streak. Today we come in with the same energy and give our best."" Atlanta had gotten even 1-1 in the fourth when Ozuna turned an 86 mph slider from Kershaw into a 109 mph rocket that went 422 feet to left for his second postseason homer. Ozuna went even deeper in the seventh a 434-foot shot to straightaway center. Wilson became the third-youngest pitcher to allow one or no hits over at least six innings in a postseason game. He struck out five and walked one starting with a 1-2-3 first on 10 pitches. “Once I got out there and threw the first pitch I felt calm cool and collected” Wilson said. “We were able to stick to the game plan and that helped a bunch to execute pitches.”CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Kershaw scratched from his scheduled start in Game 2 two days earlier because of back spams struck out four walked one and allowed four runs on seven hits in five-plus innings.

Ríos batting seventh and the fourth left-hander in a row in the Dodgers starting lineup against Wilson homered to right leading off the third. After being left off the NL Division Series roster because of a groin injury and not playing in the NLCS opener Ríos homered when starting the last two games.

Justice Democrats a left-wing outfit is launching its first six-figure ad buy aimed at electing him this fall which was mocked online by conservatives for its less-than-stellar endorsement.

The 'bleeped'-out digital ad which will air in Pennsylvania and Arizona depicted a mother who lost her job during the coronavirus pandemic. The woman is seen caring for her child at home while announcing her frustration at President Trump's handling of the outbreak in the U.S. The woman suggests that while Biden isn't exactly an exciting candidate you should still vote for him because the alternative means Trump will remain in office. “Look maybe you don't like the other guy running for president” the woman says in the ad first reported by Politico. “I get it. I don't like anyone right now. But could you do me a favor? Take 10 minutes this November and f---ing vote.” ""Can you do that for me?"" she continues.

4,Progressive group that opposed Biden in primary buys ad supporting him, It quickly became clear that in their attempts to strangle the Hunter Biden story two social media giants left themselves gasping for air. Twitter and Facebook took major steps to squelch the New York Post piece but wound up giving it far more attention than if they had done nothing and let their millions of users share it freely. For Twitter in particular if you had to come up with a plan to reinforce conservative complaints about its liberal bias you could hardly do better than for the tech giant to lock the Trump campaign’s account. Not to mention that of press secretary Kayleigh McEnany as well. Hashtag: #Fail In fact Twitter chief Jack Dorsey admitted in a tweet that the company’s conduct--censoring stories and locking accounts with little public explanation--was “unacceptable.” You got that right Jack. But then he didn’t do anything to fix it apparently viewing the self-inflicted wound as just a PR problem. Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans plan to subpoena Dorsey next week. TWITTER LOCKS OFFICIAL TRUMP CAMPAIGN ACCOUNT OVER SHARING HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook was only slightly more restrained limiting the Post story’s distribution through its secret algorithm while referring it to an outside fact-checker--the results of which are still not in. Uh how many negative stories about Trump have both companies tried to silence no matter what the sourcing? No wonder President Trump was telling a North Carolina rally yesterday that “the Bidens got rich while America got robbed...Big Tech is censoring these stories to try to get Biden out of this impossible jam.” It was a gift from the social media gods. And you know who else is blacking out the story? CNN and MSNBC except for a couple of parenthetical mentions and Joe Scarborough briefly scolding the two tech companies for blocking the story. As for the Post story itself well it’s a strange one. First let me say that the business that Hunter Biden did or attempted to do in Ukraine and elsewhere while his father was vice president was an embarrassment. He was profiteering on a family connection which may be common in Washington but is no less seedy. He admitted to a mistake months ago in a “GMA” interview while insisting he had done nothing unethical. But this was pretty fully aired during the Trump impeachment saga and I think much of the public concluded that Joe Biden didn’t take explicit steps to help his son (yes he got that prosecutor fired in what he says was an anti-corruption drive) but probably looked the other way. Now less than three weeks before the election Rudy Giuliani obtains and gives the Rupert Murdoch tabloid email exchanges with Hunter in which an executive from the Ukrainian company Burisma (Hunter served on the board) thanked him for the opportunity to meet his father then the VP.  The Biden campaign said no such meeting took place then backtracked slightly to say it’s possible but unlikely there was a brief hello at some point. How the president’s personal lawyer got those emails is a tangled tale involving John MacIsaac who runs a computer repair shop in Wilmington. He told reporters he is legally blind and thinks but is not certain that Hunter Biden brought in three laptops with hard drive problems and never returned to pick them up. MacIsaac a Republican says he discovered some of these emails and eventually told the FBI keeping a copy when the bureau subpoenaed it.  Giuliani told Sirius XM yesterday that Hunter was drunk when he brought in the laptops. The Post was tipped off by Steve Bannon who is under indictment in an unrelated case. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Separately the New York Times which had reported that Burisma was hacked by Russian intelligence said yesterday that U.S. intelligence analysts picked up chatter that stolen Burisma emails would be leaked in the form of an “October surprise.” Just in case there wasn’t enough intrigue. The Post separately reported Hunter’s correspondence with Chinese executives in which Hunter Biden stood to make millions from a deal--but these emails were from 2017 after his father left office. In an interesting twist two reporters who questioned the initial Post story on Twitter--the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman and Politico’s Jake Sherman--took heat from the left for daring to mention its existence.  Liberal Times columnist Michelle Goldberg for instance wrote: “You're really going to help Giuliani and Bannon launder this bull-- into the news cycle?” A senior producer for MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell urged people not to share or link to the story. The better journalistic response to a story that is viewed with suspicion is to do more reporting.  The attempts at erasing it from the digital square as Twitter and Facebook are finding out can backfire big time. , https://www.foxnews.com/media/why-twitter-and-facebook-squelching-the-hunter-biden-story-backfired,0.8103049930922597
5,Why Twitter and Facebook squelching the Hunter Biden story backfired," At least 118 officers have separated from the Seattle police department this year according to a report on Thursday. The separations included lateral-moves to other agencies and retirements. The bulk included those who resigned.  “Your 911 call for help will go unanswered for a significant amount of time” Seattle Police Officer Guild President Mike Solan told the Jason Rantz Show on Seattle's KTTH. SEATTLE COP CAR SET ON FIRE WITH COPS INSIDE MAN ARRESTED The 39 seperations occurred in September after the Seattle City Council made good on its promise to approve sweeping proposals that would slash the police department budget by $4 million and cut as many as 100 officers from the force. The previous four months saw a high of 16 separations in August compared to a low of 10 in both May and July. There have been at least eight separations in October so far a source told Rantz. COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE RECOMMENDS FIRING DETECTIVE FOR FACEBOOK POSTS MOCKING SEATTLE PROTESTERS HIT BY CAR Ex-Chief Carmen Best was reportedly included in the data after she left her position on Sept. 3 amid a tumultuous last few months on the job highlighted by protests against systemic racism and police violence following the death of George Floyd in police custody on May 25 in Minneapolis. Best said on her way out that the city council's police budget cuts had put her in a ""position destined to fail"" reports said. Following the mass exodus there are roughly 1200 Seattle police officers in service Rantz said.

6,At least 118 officers leave Seattle Police Department in 2020: report, Et tu C-SPAN? There is no end to the media bias against President Trump and his followers. The news that Steve Scully the political editor of the bland television network lied about being hacked to hide a message to an anti-Trumper is no ordinary moment. It is a startling confirmation that the cancer of partisanship has eaten away the heart of fairness and integrity at nearly all of America’s leading media outlets. MAINSTREAM MEDIA IGNORES DOWNPLAYS NEW YORK POST BOMBSHELL ON HUNTER BIDEN Too many so-called journalists no longer see their role as reporting the news. They take sides and twist the facts to make them fit. The bombshell about Scully who was picked to moderate the second presidential debate but is now suspended indefinitely comes on the same day that Big Tech reveals that it too is rotten to the core. Twitter and Facebook are blatantly wielding their enormous power to keep voters from learning a sordid truth about Joe Biden’s involvement with son Hunter’s business schemes. Their Democrat protection plan involves the refusal to let their users share The New York Post’s report that an email shows the former vice president met with an adviser to Burisma the Ukrainian energy company that put Hunter Biden on its board for a reported $83000 a month. The significance of the email is that Joe Biden always claimed he didn’t know anything about his son’s business and never even talked to him about it. But in the 2015 email the adviser Vadym Pozharskyi thanked Hunter Biden for the “opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together.” The social-media effort to protect Biden is especially inappropriate given that his campaign has left open the possibility that Biden as vice president did meet with Pozharskyi saying only that a review of his schedule found no evidence the meeting took place “as alleged.” It is very significant that the campaign has not said definitively the two men never met. Those elements and the stakes make this a fascinating story as the presidential campaign barrels toward a finish. After all if Biden helped his son’s Ukrainian company as vice president then suspicions immediately grow about whether the former veep also helped his son profit from the family connections in other countries including Romania and China where Joe Biden was the Obama administration’s point man. Yet CNN and other networks are resisting the urge to practice journalism and pursue the stories. They don’t even bother to ask Joe Biden the basic question of what he knew and when he knew it. One only has to imagine the resources those leftist outlets would commit to the multiple story lines if the name involved was Trump instead of Biden. Then it would be Katie bar the door. Actually we don’t have to imagine. Each and every day for the last four years Twitter and Facebook have brimmed with anti-Trump stories that are often based only on anonymous sources and speculation. And get this — even as they blocked The Post this week the tech giants allowed users to share stories published by The Washington Post and The New York Times that sought to knock down the original Post story. That’s not just unfair it’s bizarre. The demonstrable proof of bias only serves to harden the belief of Trump and his supporters that the deck is stacked against them. Can anyone honestly say they are wrong? But the stacked deck isn’t limited to the media. For comparison consider this fact: CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The FBI began spying on Trump’s 2016 campaign with far less information than The Post has published about the Biden family business. All Jim Comey’s band of dirty cops had was the salacious Steele dossier none of which was verified. It had a secondhand report about what a drunken George Papadopoulos might have said about Russia having Hillary Clinton’s emails. That was enough for the FBI to get a surveillance warrant on Carter Page an American citizen because agents withheld information from the court and lied about Page’s tie to the CIA. The result was a full-scale spying operation on the presidential campaign of a major party’s nominee. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That probe led to thousands of anti-Trump stories being published and broadcast — and nearly all of them were promoted and shared on Twitter and Facebook. Most were eventually proven wrong yet you could die waiting for admissions or apologies. If it weren’t for their double standards Big Media and Big Tech wouldn’t have any standards at all.

7,Michael Goodwin: Anti-Trump bias at Twitter Facebook and even C-SPAN replaces fairness and integrity, The New York Post delivered bombshell reports Wednesday and Thursday revealing emails that appear to show Joe Biden’s son Hunter pursued — and in some cases secured — lucrative deals with businesses in Ukraine and China by offering access to then-Vice President Biden and potentially by offering other favors. This could end up being the biggest story of this year’s presidential race. Among other discoveries in the emails is an important message indicating that Hunter Biden set up a meeting between Joe Biden and a top executive at an energy company in Ukraine Burisma Holdings. BEN SHAPIRO SHREDS 'DUMBASS' TWITTER CEO JACK DORSEY OVER BLOCKED HUNTER BIDEN REPORT: 'IT'S A CLOWN SHOW' The meeting allegedly occurred less than a year prior to Joe Biden using his position as vice president to pressure the Ukrainian government into dismissing its top prosecutor Viktor Shokin who had been conducting an investigation into the very same energy company. Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma — despite having no expertise in the energy industry — in 2014 not long after President Barack Obama put Joe Biden in charge of U.S. relations with Ukraine. The emails obtained by The New York Post also show a top executive at Burisma asking Hunter Biden for “advice on how you could use your influence” to help the company as well as separate messages showing Hunter Biden actively pursuing deals involving a top energy firm in China that would be “interesting for me and my family.” If accurate The New York Post’s reports could have a monumental impact on the presidential election now underway. It appears that at the very least Joe Biden lied to the American people — he repeatedly insisted he had nothing to do with Hunter’s business dealings — and it seems Joe Biden was engaged in highly unethical behavior using his office to enrich his son. At worst Joe Biden may have broken federal law. But as important as this incredible story is there is a much bigger story looming in the background: the way social media giants Facebook and Twitter responded to The New York Post reporting. Following the Post article’s publication Facebook and Twitter deliberately limited the news story’s distribution and blocked key figures from discussing it over their social media platforms. “While I will intentionally not link to the New York Post I want be clear that this story is eligible to be fact checked by Facebook’s third-party fact checking partners” wrote Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone in a tweet posted Wednesday. “In the meantime we are reducing its distribution on our platform.” Following its decision to block the spread of The New York Post article on Twitter a spokesperson for the company said: “In line with our Hacked Materials Policy as well as our approach to blocking URLs we are taking action to block any links to or images of the material in question on Twitter.” Censorship by Facebook and Twitter of The New York Post’s report on Hunter and Joe Biden is an outrageous example of social media companies’ proclivity to silence conservative content and bury negative stories about the left. This is perhaps the most important attempt ever made by a social media company to alter the outcome of an American election. If Facebook and Twitter had applied similar protocols to stories meant to hurt President Trump they would have never allowed users to share the countless articles published by mainstream outlets about unverified accounts of the Trump campaign allegedly colluding with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election. They also would have blocked the recent New York Times report about President Trump’s tax records. Yet social media giants allowed those articles to be shared widely. Why? Because social media companies are now working tirelessly to protect Democrats and destroy the Republican Party. They are partisan institutions masquerading as “open platforms” and operate daily as extensions of America’s left. The blatant censorship displayed by Facebook and Twitter regarding The New York Post story should send a chill down the spine of every American. What these companies are doing in this crucial period when voting has already begun in the Nov. 3 election is reprehensible and dangerous for the preservation of our constitutional republic. Facebook and Twitter are two of the largest distributors of news in the world. Twelve percent of all U.S. adults say they access news sites on Twitter. And 43 percent of adults say they get news from Facebook. If Facebook Twitter and other tech giants are permitted to ban the sharing of news stories published by reputable outlets they can ban virtually any form of political speech. This is dangerous because free speech is the foundation upon which all free societies exist. Many on the left and even some on the right argue that because Facebook and Twitter are private companies they should be allowed to ban anything they want on their platforms. As libertarians we are sympathetic to that argument. We believe that in an open marketplace companies should have the freedom to set their own rules and consumers should “vote” for the services they like with their dollars time and product use. But social media companies do not operate in a truly free market. They benefit from special legal protections granted to them by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which allows them to escape legal liability for erroneous information posted by third parties on their site. In a perfectly free-market system platforms would be held liable when users publish illicit content on their website. The only reason that isn’t the case is because the federal government has created special rules that permit Facebook and Twitter to operate in their current forms. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER These companies have made billions of dollars because of these unique legal protections. And how have they repaid the American people? By refusing to operate in good faith and silencing speech that’s inconvenient for their political allies. Now the tech titans are wielding more power than ever. With a single keystroke they have the power to conceal information that the public has a right to know. It’s long past time for Congress to repeal Section 230 and replace it with a new federal law that would grant special liability protections to only those social media companies that sincerely work toward providing open platforms that protect — not punish or silence — all forms of political speech as well as many other forms of speech. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Reasonable restrictions on pornography extreme violence and other content not suited for mass distribution should be allowed of course. But social media companies should never be permitted to ban Americans’ political speech — whether that speech come from liberals conservatives libertarians or socialists — while also earning a fortune from legal carve-outs granted to them by the same people who are being unjustly silenced. A failure to act now would only embolden the social media giants to continue expanding their speech bans and further limit the ability for people of all political social and religious persuasions from engaging in open dialogue.

Viewers who tuned into the Peacock Network expected to hear questions from voters. However Guthrie spent most of the first 20 minutes grilling Trump on masks and White supremacy.

12,Trump and Biden take part in separate town halls here's the takeaway," We are wrapping up a historic event in our nation: the Senate confirmation hearing for 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett for a seat on the Supreme Court. If confirmed Judge Barrett would be the first mother of school-age children to serve on the high court. As any mom can attest balancing schoolwork dinner and bath time with emails conference calls and job duties is harder than ever. And with seven children Judge Barrett’s willingness to jump into serving on the Supreme Court is a real boost to #mompower. To get here Judge Barrett has had to endure a grueling degree of scrutiny from lawmakers and the media. Folks have undermined her as a person attacked her family and children and challenged her religious beliefs. ABA BARRETT ALLIES LAUD NOMINEE AS 'BRILLIANT' AS DEMOCRAT WITNESSES WARN OF 'REAL-WORLD HARM' IF CONFIRMED Her political opponents have tried to paint Judge Barret’s nomination as some sort of dystopian fulfillment of “The Handmaid’s Tale” falsely portraying her as a domestic maidservant to her dominating husband. Of course this narrative is ridiculous and cartoonish. It is a full fireworks display of the hatred Hollywood types and their coastal elite friends have toward people of faith the heartland and conservative women.  The irony of these attacks is just how demeaning to women they really are — implying that Judge Barrett a working mother of seven with a strong record of professional and academic accomplishment isn’t capable of a seat on the highest court of the land. Anyone who watched the Judiciary Committee hearing this week knows that Judge Barrett ran circles around 10 Democratic senators. She invoked complex legal analyses and thoughtful rationales about her judicial philosophy as well as a sense of service and duty to her nation. While explaining how she and her family made the life-changing decision to accept President Trump’s nomination to the Supreme Court Judge Barrett posed a question that has stuck with me: “Why should I say someone else should do the difficulty? If the difficulty is the only reason to say no then I should serve my country.” CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Moms deal with difficult problems all the time. And we just make it work. After spending time getting to know Judge Barrett as a mother jurist and professor it is not at all a surprise to hear of her deep sense of duty and acceptance of the difficulty.  This sense of duty and a broader purpose is something I can relate to having served my country in the Army Reserve and Iowa Army National Guard. And it’s something Americans from all walks of life — from veterans and service members to moms and dads doctors and nurses teachers and law enforcement officers — can relate to.  Amy Coney Barrett is a role model for young girls and an example of the great freedoms American women have to be who they want to be. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As I said earlier this week we don’t have to choose a narrow definition of womanhood. We can build our lives as we choose. Judge Barrett said so herself: “I've made distinct choices. I've decided to pursue a career and have a large family. I have a multiracial family. Our faith is important to us. All of those things are true but they are my choices.""  Most importantly this week Judge Barrett presented a compelling case that she would be a thoughtful restrained and wise Supreme court justice who would defend the Constitution. I’m grateful that the American people have had the opportunity to get to know her. Because folks Amy Coney Barrett truly shows what a mom can do. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM SEN.

14,Live Updates: Amy Coney Barrett's Senate confirmation hearing," Tyrrell Hatton felt grumpy from not getting much sleep and then he felt he was in a dream when he was 5 under through the opening five holes of the CJ Cup at Shadow Creek. The reality of Thursday was that even coming off an emotional win at Wentworth and a long trip from London across eight time zones Hatton hasn't lost his touch. He tied the course record of 7-under 65 for a one-shot lead. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM “It's fair to say I'm pretty tired at the moment” Hatton said. ""Still struggling a little bit with jet lag. As you can tell by my voice picked up a little bit of a sore throat on the way over. Today was a long day. Very happy with my score and I just need to try and get back to the hotel have a good rest and hopefully sleep better than I did last night. “And fingers crossed for another good day."" Hatton posted the lowest competitive round at Shadow Creek mainly because this is the first PGA Tour event at the prestigious club. Dustin Johnson not playing this week because of a positive test result for the coronavirus had a 65 during a casual round in 2015. Xander Schauffele birdied the par-5 18th for a 66 and was one shot behind along with Russell Henley. Jon Rahm and Tyler Duncan were another shot behind. Rory McIlroy bogeyed his last three holes a streak that began with him missing a 3-foot par putt for a 73. Brooks Koepka in his first tournament since taking two months off to heal an ailing left hip showed plenty of signs of rust. He closed with a short iron into the water on the par-5 18th for a bogey and a 74. It's hard to imagine a better start than Hatton. He holed a 10-foot birdie putt on his opening hole at No. 10. He laid up off the tee on the reachable par-4 11th with a 7-iron and still couldn't hit the fairway but managed to hit wedge to 3 feet for birdie. He holed out with a lob wedge on the next hole from 92 yards. And on the 14th he ran in a 25-foot birdie. “It was nice to have momentum early” he said. “I imagine it would have been a lot tougher round if being as tired as I was we didn't quite have that momentum.” Hatton was among six players outside London last week for the BMW PGA Championship which the Englishman won on the course where he watched as a young lad and was inspired to play golf. So there was emotion and then a 20-hour trip door-to-door to Las Vegas for a tournament that moved this year from South Korea because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He did well on the eve of the tournament — a little more than five hours sleep which got him to 5 a.m. It didn't affect his golf as much as his mood. “I was grumpy out there. I was quite agitated” he said. “Even though I had a really good score going I was just on edge. That's generally quite a hard thing for me to manage. I wasn't happy with how I managed myself after some poor shots but I think this is easy. Everyone loses their cool when they're tired and haven't slept enough.” Rahm's biggest concern was the speed on his putting with courses at home in Arizona over-seeding and the greens running on the slow side. What made his round was holing three putts in a row around the turn — one of them for par — to feel more at ease on the slick greens of Shadow Creek. The only mishap was reaching into his bag for a new glove and realizing they were the wrong size. He had to hustle back to a trash bin to retrieve the one he had been using until he could get a replacement at the turn. No one had a tougher day than U.S. Open runner-up Matthew Wolff who didn't make a birdie in his round of 80. Jordan Spieth salvaged what could have been a rough day. He was so wild off the tee at times that he hit provisional tee shots on three consecutive holes. He didn't have to use any of them birdied three straight round the turn to get to 1 under only to hit a fourth provisional — this one he needed — in making a triple bogey on the 14th. He shot a 74.

17,Live Updates: Trump Biden participate in dueling town halls, Former Mexican defense secretary Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos who led the country’s army for six years under ex-President Enrique Peña Nieto has been arrested on drug trafficking and money laundering charges at Los Angeles International Airport U.S. and Mexican sources said Thursday. Two people with knowledge of the arrest said Cienfuegos was taken into custody on a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration warrant. One of the people said the warrant was for drug trafficking and money laundering charges. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly. The DEA declined to comment Thursday night. Mexico’s Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard wrote on his Twitter account that U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau had informed him of the retired general’s arrest and that Cienfuegos had a right to receive consular assistance. TRUDEAU: US-CANADA BORDER TO REMAIN CLOSED UNTIL CORONAVIRUS UNDER CONTROL  A senior Mexican official who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to give details of the case said Cienfuegos was arrested when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport with his family. His family members were released and he was taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center. Cienfuegos served from 2012 to 2018 as secretary of defense under Peña Nieto. He is the highest-ranking former Cabinet official arrested since the top Mexican security official Genaro Garcia Luna was arrested in Texas in 2019. Garcia Luna who served under former President Felipe Calderón has pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges. Cienfuegos is 72 years old and has retired from active duty. Mexico’s Defense Department had no immediate reaction to the arrest. Mike Vigil the DEA’s former chief of international operations said when he was in Mexico in 2012 he heard corruption allegations about Cienfuegos. “There were always allegations of corruption nothing we could sink our teeth into. That was kind of unheard of because Mexico has always put the military on a pedestal” said Vigil author of the book “The Land of Enchantment Cartel.” BORDER PATROL AGENT'S HUNCH PAYS OFF IN SECOND-LARGEST METHAMPHETAMINE BUST EVER “The corruption is just coming to roost because individuals who were once untouchable are now getting arrested” Vigil said. “If they cooperate (with U.S. prosecutors) there are others who are going to be falling noting U.S. officials “usually don’t want to trade down they usually trade up” seeking evidence against equal or higher-ranking officials. “It’s really a precarious situation for Mexico to have two Cabinet-level officials arrested in the U.S.” Whatever the charges it will be a tough blow for Mexico where the army and navy are some of the few remaining respected public institutions. While current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed to go after corruption and lawbreaking under past administrations he has also relied more heavily on the army — and charged it with more tasks ranging from building infrastructure projects to distributing medical supplies — than any other president in recent history. Under Cienfuegos the Mexican army was accused of frequent human rights abuses but that was true of both his predecessors and his successor in the post. The worst scandal in Cienfuegos’ tenure involved the 2014 army killings of suspects in a grain warehouse. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The June 2014 massacre involved soldiers who killed 22 suspects at the warehouse in the town of Tlatlaya. While some died in an initial shootout with the army patrol — in which one soldier was wounded — a human rights investigation later showed that at least eight and perhaps as many as a dozen suspects were executed after they surrendered. , https://www.foxnews.com/world/mexicos-former-defense-secretary-arrested-at-lax-on-drug-money-charges,0.8103701735683296
18,Mexico’s former defense secretary arrested at LAX on drug money charges," Nick Saban won’t be allowed to coach No. 2 Alabama from home against third-ranked Georgia per NCAA guidelines and also can't be in the stadium while testing positive for COVID-19. Saban said on his radio show Thursday night that he hasn't had a fever or any symptoms and has still been able to perform all his normal work duties from home. “I feel great I don't have any problems"" Saban said. “I've been able to do everything that I would do if I were working from (the office) whether it's being in meetings watching film with the coaches watching practice film have communication on the field that I can still correct players.” CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM He said offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian a former Southern California and Washington head coach will handle the head coaching decisions on the sideline during the game. Alabama said earlier that Saban was evaluated by team doctor Jimmy Robinson Thursday “and is doing fine.” ""He is continuing to self-isolate and will remain in the SEC testing protocol while being evaluated daily” the school said. When asked if a coach who remained positive could coach from an isolated room at the stadium SEC spokesman Herb Vincent cited CDC guidelines saying “people who are in isolation should stay home until it’s safe for them to be around others.” Then there are the NCAA restrictions. NCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn referred to the rules interpretation written by national coordinator of football officials Steve Shaw when asked about Saban coaching. In an earlier response to the prospect of any coach being in quarantine because of COVID-19 Shaw's interpretation was that coaches aren’t allowed to use technology to call in plays or communicate with the team in the locker room. “Rule 1-4-11-b is very specific and allows only voice communications between the press box and the team area therefore in (a) the coach could not call into the press box or the sideline for anything related to coaching purposes” Shaw wrote. He also interpreted Rule 1-4-11-a as prohibiting the use of computers or other technology “for coaching purposes” including any virtual communication with the team during a game. “This prohibition would begin at 90 minutes before the scheduled kickoff when the officiating crew assumes jurisdiction of the game and would include the time between periods until the end of the game when the Referee declares the score final” the interpretation read. The 68-year-old Saban and athletic director Greg Byrne tested positive for COVID on Wednesday. Robinson said at the time that they were the only positive tests in the program. He questioned the rule keeping head coaches who test positive from having an in-game role saying “there's ways to do this where you wouldn't be putting people in harm's way.” “If you're the head coach there ought to be a better way to do it"" Saban said. ”I don't know exactly what that is but there should be a better way to do that. “You ought to be able to have some kind of communication with the sidelines."" Alabama hasn't disclosed positive tests among players since the pandemic started but Saban said Wednesday that they “haven’t had any indication” of an outbreak among players. The Tide is coming off a game against Mississippi which this week had an undisclosed number of players test positive. New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick a close friend of Saban said they spoke recently “about how much we’ve learned with this situation and some of the challenges that have come with it.” “I know he’s been extremely vigilant and put a great deal of thought and effort into the care of his team and players” Belichick said. “He shared that with me. We both talked about things that we’ve done and have been helpful and so forth. So I just want to wish him the best from all of us here and the organization.” Giants coach Joe Judge is betting on Saban over the virus. “He’ll probably beat COVID” Judge said. “He’s got a pretty good record against every other opponent so I am confident coach will come through this.” ", https://www.foxnews.com/sports/saban-still-asymptomatic-but-sidelined-for-alabama-georgia,0.8102990590338663

20,Chris Wallace: 'I've got a real problem' with Facebook Twitter restricting NY Post Hunter Biden report," EXCLUSIVE -- With the 2020 presidential election less than a few weeks away -- encumbered yet again by questions and concerns surrounding ballot security and fraud -- revolutionary blockchain voting technology is being piloted in small pockets of the country. And Tuesday marked the first time a vote has ever been cast for a U.S. president in the general election using such an app on a personal mobile phone Fox News has learned exclusively.  “This is a historic day not only for ballot integrity and election systems but for liberty and the republic itself” Josh Daniels a Utah resident told Fox News in a statement.  His vote went to former “Mighty Ducks” child actor turned cryptocurrency entrepreneur turned 2020 independent candidate Brock Pierce.  “In true pioneer spirit Utah County is honored to be the first place where a Blockchain vote was cast in a presidential general election” said Utah County Clerk Amelia Powers Gardner who implemented the “Voatz” platform as both a security and cost-cutting measure 20 months ago. “We are proud to lead our state and the nation on this innovative and cutting edge technology.” Gardner who has been using the system for five elections says it is “one of the most cost-effective initiatives"" that her office has undertaken since she was elected 20 months ago. FLORIDIANS HAVE ALREADY CAST 1.8 MILLION BALLOTS FOR THE 2020 ELECTION And much of Pierce’s own campaign is centered on the push for technological innovation to solve the plethora of problems nationwide and ensure America retains her spot as the global frontrunner in modernization and advancement across all major industries. “The problem with the internet is that you can copy anything – songs videos pictures. Internet technology does not allow for the information to stay in one place only” Pierce told Fox News. “But blockchain is a database at its core and that database is impervious to any type of duplication meaning it cannot be tampered with and there can only be one version of it so when we talk about voting it is perfectly suited to elections. It ensures the absolute integrity of our elections; it ensures voters can vote with confidence.” Just last week the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the FBI released a joint advisory warning of “advanced persistent threat (APT) actors chaining vulnerabilities—a commonly used tactic exploiting multiple vulnerabilities in the course of a single intrusion—in an attempt to compromise federal and state local tribal and territorial (SLTT) government networks critical infrastructure and elections organizations.” CISA stressed that it is “aware of some instances where this activity resulted in unauthorized access to elections support systems; however it has no evidence to date that integrity of elections data has been compromised” – at least for now. From Pierce’s lens this should all be a problem of the past – at least in elections to come – and is slowly becoming a staple of the present. The U.S. electoral system for the most part in Pierce’s purview is still trying to use “20th-century solutions for 21st-century problems” but through blockchain “everyone can vote from their phone with no need to go to a voting booth.” For one “Voatz” was most recently used in the 2020 Utah State GOP Convention and enabled voting for almost 4000 delegates in 40 races in addition to the Arizona GOP Convention South Dakota GOP Convention and the Michigan Democratic Party Convention. It was also used as a temporary mobile voting solution to record votes for deployed U.S. military members by West Virginia in 2018 during the 2017 Tufts Community Union Senate Election in Massachusetts as well as to authenticate delegate badges at the 2016 Massachusetts Democratic State Convention and So how does the technology work? The Voatz app which requires a phone number photo identification and an authenticating “selfie” uses both blockchain technology and biometrics to verify the voter’s identity. A secure token is issued via fingerprint activation and once a vote is submitted it is printed and fed into a collation machine for tabulation.  “Voatz is a mobile elections platform that allows disenfranchised groups access to voting including overseas citizens deployed military and people with disabilities” a spokesperson for the company told Fox News. “It’s the only platform designed to meet the four criteria required for mobile voting: security identity confirmation accessibility and audibility.” The spokesperson also underscored that “all submitted ballots are eligible to undergo a public citizen’s post-election audit in which anyone is able to participate as an auditor hosted by the National Cybersecurity Center.” However it is one of several blockchain applications cropping up across the U.S. in what many entrepreneurs predict is a pivotal step in ensuring fraud-free and fair elections. According to data compiled by Pitchbook a capital marketing company more than $420 million has been poured into at least 27 election tech startups by 88 investors since the 2016 election with the intention of revolutionizing the U.S. voting system. PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON MAIL-IN BALLOT SIGNATURE CONTROVERSY Supporters of the blockchain voting modalities are also quick to point out that it is a pro for both sides of the political aisle and one that will ultimately lead to increased voter numbers and civic engagement across the board given its accessibility. Average voter turnout in the United States for general elections over the past five decades hovers at around 52% with local government elections often as low as under 10%. “The accessibility will drive engagement. It will allow many more people to participate in the democratic process” Pierce said. “And it’s a bipartisan solution – all parties want security and all parties want more voters and higher engagement.” And in terms of ensuring that those without phones or in lower socio-economic community sectors Pierce underscored that it need not be an “all or nothing” approach and that electronic voting should be utilized in addition to traditional polling booths. However turning to blockchain – and in due course the thin rectangles that slip into one’s pocket – to carry out our constitutional right is one that is met with skepticism and security concerns by some experts who say some of the touted technology just is not there yet. “As common sense dictates in lockstep with improvements in technology and information security hackers have started getting more creative with the scams and hacks they carry out and blockchain breaches have been famously eviscerated with hacks” contended Carl Herberger vice president of security services at CyberSheath. “Through these hacks we’ve learned that you could be one click away from malware that will cause harm to your files and crypto-assets.

21,First presidential vote cast using blockchain technology, America’s Cup challenger American Magic has launched its second racing yacht in Auckland revealing significant design developments compared with its predecessor. The 75-foot Patriot was publicly revealed by the New York Yacht Club-backed team at its launching ceremony Friday morning local time. Patriot more closely approaches the design features of boats developed by defender Team New Zealand and Italian challenger of record Luna Rossa which had a head start in the design process because they collaborated in forming the class rule. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM American Magic appears to have moved away from the flat-bottomed design of its experimental first-generation sailboat Defiant to a deeper skiff-style design apparently favored by the New Zealand and Italian teams. The striking deep blue Patriot also features flared decks at the bow with the helm and grinding stations more deeply inset into the deck for aerodynamic reasons. The helm has also been moved forward. Patriot’s debut precedes a flurry of launches. British syndicate INEOS Team UK will launch its new boat Saturday and Luna Rossa will do so on Tuesday. The four competing syndicates will first race each other for the first time in the Christmas Cup from Dec. 17-20.

22,US challenger launches 2nd America's Cup boat in Auckland," Zumretay Arkin posed a question in a recent on-line meeting with Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr. the prominent International Olympic Committee member who oversees preparations for the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing. “Why should China a country running concentration camps with at least 1 million Muslim Uighurs being detained be allowed to hold the Olympics?"" she asked. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Arkin a spokeswoman for the World Uyghur Congress told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that the response was disappointing. “We gave the IOC representatives first-hand testimony about our personal experiences and how we are impacted by China’s repressive policies"" Arkin said. ""We were hoping it would open the door to a more valuable exchange."" Instead the IOC repeated its stance: It’s not a political body and doesn’t take a position on human-rights issues. It simply organizes sports events. The Uighur body and other human-rights groups sent an open letter a month ago to IOC President Thomas Bach asking that the games be removed from China. In reply the IOC arranged an on-line meeting last week that included groups representing Tibet Hong Kong and others. In a statement to the AP the IOC said: “Awarding the Olympic Games to a national Olympic committee does not mean that the IOC agrees with the political structure social circumstances or human rights standards in its country. ... The IOC has neither the mandate nor the capability to change the laws or the political system of a sovereign country.” Arvin was born in Xinjiang immigrated to Canada and still has family in northwestern China. She described Xinjiang as a human-rights issue not simply a political issue. “I am truly disappointed with the IOC’s response” Dorjee Tseten of Students for a Free Tibet said in a statement after the meeting. ""The Olympics should be a celebration of cultural diversity but what China is doing is cultural genocide. ... Hosting the Olympics in China at this time when there are millions of people incarcerated is tantamount to the IOC giving China approval of these crimes.” Although it says it remains above politics the IOC holds observer status at the United Nations and has trumpeted its efforts to bring peace to North and South Korea. That was a constant theme at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang South Korea. Arkin said the World Uyghur Congress is not asking for a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympics. That does not seem likely anyway although calls for strong measures have come from Iain Duncan Smith former leader of Britain's Conservative Party and U.S. senators Marco Rubio and Robert Menedez. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has not ruled out a boycott. Australian Senator Rex Patrick has called for one. China in response has repeatedly blamed critics for “politicizing sporting events"" and going against the Olympic Charter. Arkin said the human rights coalition hoped to target some of the IOC's 14 top sponsors and might get support from athletes who are sympathetic to Black Lives Matter protests in the United States. Turkish soccer player Mesut Ozil has called the issue in Xinjiang “Muslim Lives Matter.” Arkin said the coalitions hoped to meet again with the IOC though it's impossible to see either side giving in. The IOC is also being pressured to change its Rule 50 which would allow athletes more latitude to protest at the Olympics — including in China. Beijing wound up with the 2022 Winter Olympics almost by accident. A handful of favored European countries put off by the costs pulled out of the bidding before the vote in 2015 leaving only Beijing and Almaty Kazakhstan as the candidates. Beijing won by four votes. Arkin calls what's happening in Xinjiang a “genocide” though others have called it a “cultural genocide” or “ethnic cleansing.” She said between 1.8 million and 3 million Uighurs have been forcibly held in “re-education camps” with evidence of women undergoing forced abortions or sterilization. There is evidence of other detainees being moved to forced labor camps. China faced pressure over human rights in the run-up the 2008 Olympics but the country seemed to be opening at the time as it gave foreign reporters more scope to report in the country. The 2008 Olympics were supposed to change China. “In 2008 the international community strongly believed that bringing the Olympics to China would open up China” Arkin said. “And there was a lot of hope around this idea. Now no one believes this is going to bring change. It’s just going to be a propaganda parade from the Chinese government.” ", https://www.foxnews.com/sports/more-questions-on-human-rights-for-beijing-winter-olympics,0.8103099252264847

25,Liam Neeson wishes stunt work was recognized by big awards shows," EXCLUSIVE: David Bowie was different. Effervescent even.  The English singer-songwriter and actor exuded an aura that permeated those around him at every turn in his life and up until his death in January 2016 at the age of 69. The “Space Oddity” performer was a consummate showman with a big heart and even bigger impact in the colliding worlds of music fashion and the arts. “You couldn't really take a bad picture of David to be honest. I mean I didn't. But nobody else did either” Mick Rock longtime friend and photographer to Bowie and the stars told Fox News. “He was a sweet soul and he was very kind to me at times in my life when I was having not such a great time like when I had quadruple bypass heart surgery in 1996. And he actually sent me some money and he cosigned some prints which I was able to sell. So he was not only incredibly photogenic he was amazingly talented as a musician as an actor and as a man.” Rock is a London native who throughout the years has released numerous collections of Bowie images including the “The Rise of David Bowie."" It came in conjunction with Bowie’s 1972 groundbreaking album “The Rise of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars."" DAVID BOWIE 'STRUGGLED FOR YEARS' TO TELL THE STORY OF ZIGGY STARDUST GUITARIST MICK RONSON SAYS FILMMAKER The 72-year-old is part of a cohort of over 25 immensely talented photographers who have each photographed Bowie at various stages in his life and are all featured in “David Bowie: Icon: The Definitive Photographic Collection.” The volume -- which also includes personal essays from additional photogs such as Janet Macoska Terry O'Neill Norman Parkinson and Masayoshi Sukita as well as rarely seen private moments and candid snapshots of Bowie -- serves as the ultimate coffee table book and one that is almost guaranteed to invoke conversation and much deeper exploration into the life of Bowie. “‘Icons' is its own thing. I mean it's really great stuff. It's got a lot of pictures I've never seen before” Rock raved of the collection. “I personally know a couple of the photographers in there but David felt he was a very photogenic man and this book brings it out because no matter who photographed him they got great pictures.” THE REAL REASON DAVID BOWIE'S EYES ARE DIFFERENT COLORS Of his initial foray into becoming close with the rock legend Rock said: “I was young. I was relatively early in the whole thing. I first met him in early 1972 before the release of 'Ziggy Stardust.' And obviously 'Ziggy Stardust' is a key work because that's the image a lot of people still have of him and then that's what launched him onto the international stage. He was a lovely guy I have to say. He was a very compassionate guy. He photographed beautifully. “I’ve got pictures in here from three periods from 'Ziggy Stardust' 'Thin White Duke' and also from 2002 and I have video from the 2002 session I'm happy to say. And I've done exhibitions all over the place. But again it didn't matter who photographed him and obviously everybody has their own version but all the pictures are fabulous what can I tell you?” Rock quipped. The photog and illustrator -- who has photographed the likes of Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters founder Dave Grohl and Marilyn Manson -- went on to share the reason that Bowie was ""up for meeting"" with him that first time around.  According to Rock he had maintained an unwavering relationship and connection he had developed with the late Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett around 1969. DAVID BOWIE'S WIFE IMAN SHARES PHOTOS OF TRIBUTE TATTOOS ON 2-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF SINGER'S DEATH “David was fascinated” Rock said of Bowie’s interest in the Pink Floyd frontman. “They were very similar in certain ways as well as they were both very photogenic. They were both very innovative. But Syd obviously didn't have the powerful psyche that David had. Imagine all the pressures that David had to deal with over 40 years.” Rock said he had no idea how such an enigmatic person in Bowie could remain so clandestine given his status in the world. “Everybody wanting a piece of him but he didn't walk around with bodyguards” Rock explained. “I mean some of these characters I know have bodyguards and that's their choice why not? And he did have bodyguards in the early years but he would walk around New York all the time.” Added Rock: “For someone who was so overtly visual and everybody knew who he was – and certainly in the '70s – he was amazingly good at being invisible in New York. And considering he went out a decent amount there are very few pictures of him from the last two years of his life.” HBO'S 'DAVID BOWIE: THE LAST FIVE YEARS' CHRONICLES THE SINGER'S PRIVATE APPROACH TO CANCER THROUGH SONG Of the many of the images of Bowie that may or may not see the light of day – the one constant is they remain priceless artifacts connected to one of the industry’s most mysterious souls.  “Many people don't know how he was a cheerful soul and he was very playful” Rock recalled of Bowie’s penchant to turn it up a notch whenever a lens was nearby. “You could see it in lots of the pictures. He was a kind man too but when he came for a session he came to play.” STRANGE DINOSAUR WITH STAR-LIKE SKULL NAMED AFTER DAVID BOWIE “Outside of a young Elvis Presley I mean [Bowie] was the most photogenic man to ever come out of rock and roll.

After graduating summa cum laude and first in her class from Notre Dame Law School she clerked at the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and at the Supreme Court for Justice Antonin Scalia. A professor of law for 15 years Judge Barrett’s academic scholarship — which has focused on constitutional interpretation stare decisis and statutory interpretation — is profound and impactful. It’s also been highly recognized. She was named “distinguished professor of the year” by three graduating classes and has been published extensively in top law journals throughout the country. Judge Barrett’s remarkable legal career to date is impressive on its own. But it’s the universal respect and admiration she’s earned from her colleagues that really stands out. Supporting her nomination to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals her fellow Supreme Court clerks stated: “We are Democrats Republicans and independents and we have diverse points of view on politics judicial philosophy and much else. Yet we all write to support the nomination of Professor Barrett. ... Professor Barrett is a woman of remarkable intellect and character. She is eminently qualified for the job.” Her colleagues at Notre Dame expressed similar unanimous praise in 2017 writing: “As a scholarly community we have a wide range of political views as well as commitments to different approaches to judicial methodology and judicial craft. We are united however in our judgment about Amy. ... She possesses in abundance all of the other qualities that shape extraordinary jurists: discipline intellect wisdom impeccable temperament and above all fundamental decency and humanity.” As a judge Judge Barrett has consistently demonstrated the utmost impartiality and restraint — qualities essential to the equal interpretation of the law. As she stated at the announcement of her nomination: “A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold.” In this Judge Barrett’s rhetoric has matched her judicial record. Americans can be confident that Judge Barrett will continue to interpret the law and the Constitution as it is written.

However the high school marching bands that are still playing have been working to adjust to a new normal.  High school seniors are feeling the impact more than ever as they prepare for college. In Georgia Norcross High School senior and drum major Bailey Lesko said she feels lucky to still play her instrument during the pandemic.  “I would have cried a ton if we hadn’t got to do marching band this year” Lesko said.  Marching band practices and performances are much different from last year but Lesko said the atmosphere is better than ever before.   “There’s way more buy-in there’s way more responsibility a sense of we really need to do this and we need to do it well because we know that not everybody is here” Lesko said.  The Norcross High School marching band has successfully played in three football games. The director of bands Lee Newman said the band is taking extra precautions to stay safe.   “Students have to report super early now and they answer a set questions that the county office and the health department gave to us. And then we take their temperatures so anything that’s over 98 you’re also sent home” Newman said.  In addition “Everybody has to stay 6 feet apart all the time so even when you see the show they're spread out more than they normally would” Newman said.   Newman said the staff parents and students are keeping the band going and the seniors on the field are leading the way.  “They were pretty down... but they wanted to have band so bad that they adapted pretty quickly. They have been a huge driving force behind wearing masks and staying 6 feet apart” Newman said.  Marching band senior Nicholas Avradopoulous said he has seen just how lucky they are. “I’ve realized at other games not many of the other bands are able to play and it makes me so appreciative of what we have here” Avradopoulous said.  Nicholas and Bailey both hope to participate in the marching band in college but the admission process may be different.   In Mississippi Jackson State University band director Roderick Little said its program is trying to think of new and innovative ways to keep students engaged.  “For many years most senior classes have always I don’t want to say taken for granted but they have had the opportunity to go and apply for colleges and get scholarships and move in to their dormitories when everything was quote-unquote normal -- but these seniors have not had the autonomy of doing that” Little said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Little said the band is still searching for talented students and “We do plan on auditioning those students and providing them an opportunity to be a part of our band because one thing that we do know … We do know that this pandemic will not last forever and once everything subsides we do want a strong band program.” The Louisiana State University band director Kelvin Jones said they're just thankful to still be able to make music. “Instead of us being able to go into high schools and to work with groups in a hands-on basis a lot of that has been virtual” Jones said.  Lesko has met with colleges virtually but she said it’s just not the same.  “I’m hoping that next year will be normal so that when I go to college and meet these people in person for the first time and I get to experience these programs -- I really hope it’s going to be like what they’ve told me over the phone and what I’ve seen in Zoom calls” Lesko said.

Helen Jones 61 was leaving her home in the city’s Germantown section during the early morning of Oct. 6 when an unknown male assailant approached and doused her with what fire officials later determined was chlorosulfuric acid police said. “There was a man there and he was like ‘Hey are you good?’ As if he was inquiring about her safety making sure she was OK” Jones’ daughter Aneesha Summerville told WPVI. “And when she looked up to say yes he threw the stuff in her face and ran off.” Jones — who had burns to her nose mouth eyes and throat — was rushed to a hospital in serious condition police said adding that a motive in the attack was unclear.

Jones didn’t know her attacker but could likely identify him even though he was wearing a mask that covered his nose and mouth at the time her daughter said. “It was totally unexpected” Summerville continued. “She saw his eyes.

32,Second Syracuse University freshman dies in as many days," With the November election less than three weeks away President Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden will stump in key battleground states on Friday making a final appeal to voters one night after their dueling town halls. The candidates participated in competing town halls in different cities on different networks Thursday night: Trump on NBC from Miami and Biden on ABC from Philadelphia. The second presidential debate was originally scheduled for that night but Trump backed out last week when debate organizers announced the forum would be virtual following the president's positive COVID-19 diagnosis.   Trump was grilled by NBC News' moderator Savannah Guthrie on the coronavirus pandemic taxes white supremacy and QAnon while Biden faced questions about his stances on expanding the Supreme Court defunding the police and banning fracking.  BIDEN MOVES ON COURT PACKING STANCE WHILE TRUMP SPARS WITH NBC IN DUELING TOWN HALLS Here's what you need to know about the presidential campaigns and how they'll be spending Friday Oct. 16 2020 just 19 days away from the election. Trump will start his day by campaigning in Flordia a vital swing state. He's slated to leave Trump National Doral Miami for Fort Myers where he will deliver remarks on ""Protecting America's Seniors."" From there Trump will head to Ocala about two hours north of Orlando for a Make America Great Again Rally.  Once that concludes Trump will travel to Georgia for a second rally in Macon which is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET.  A RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Biden with a slim 1.7 percentage point lead in Florida and a razor-thin 0.4 percentage point lead in Georgia.  The former vice president is making a swing through southeastern Michigan with planned stops in Southfield and Detroit.  Biden's campaign said the candidate will deliver remarks on protecting and expanding access to health care in Southfield before heading to Detroit for a ""voter mobilization event.""

Sprik who was left paralyzed from the waist down after being involved in a car crash checked into the game during the fourth quarter. ARCH MANNING PUTS ON SHOW IN FIRST HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAME OF SEASON Sprik got help from his teammates to get out of his chair and was carried into the end zone on a 1st-and-goal play from the goal line.

On Wednesday Twitter and Facebook acted no different than Communist state-run media organizations that corruptly block the distribution of information and news stories they don't like. These social media networks run by high-tech oligarchs in Silicon Valley -- in the tank for the Democratic Party -- barred a sourced New York Post story exposing alleged emails between Joe Biden's son Hunter and a powerful Ukrainian executive while Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukraine natural gas company -- getting paid as much as $50000 per month despite no industry expertise -- while Vice President Biden was the point man on Ukraine during the Obama administration. Not only did Facebook and Twitter block users from posting the bombshell report calling Joe Biden's statements denying knowledge of his son's business dealings into question amongst other valid concerns but also Twitter locked the New York Post's account and that of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. TUCKER CARLSON: NEW EMAILS REVEAL EXACTLY WHAT BURISMA WANTED FROM JOE BIDEN ""It's not a temporary blockage"" McEnany told Fox News host Sean Hannity. ""When I log on to my Twitter account it says I'm permanently banned. They essentially have me at gunpoint and said unless you delete this story a news story by the New York Post I cannot regain access to my account."" If this type of thuggish censorship and election interference doesn't send a chill up your spine what will? BRENT BOZELL: NY POST'S HUNTER BIDEN STORY CENSORED BY FACEBOOK TWITTER -- BIG TECH VOTES FOR BIDEN The reality is that if the arrogant overlords in Silicon Valley can censor the president's tweets which they do regularly as well as a top White House official and major newspaper for reporting on a presidential candidate during an election then no American citizen or media outlet is safe from similar censorship. On Thursday the power-trippers at Twitter continued their out of control censorship by silencing high-ranking members of Congress and links they post to government websites. ""Twitter is now blocking an official government website to protect Joe Biden"" tweeted House Republican Whip Steve Scalise. ""WATCH what happens when you click the link to @JudiciaryGOP's website. Twitter censors the United States House of Representatives but not propaganda from Communist China and Iran. Let that sink in."" Twitter Safety said in a tweet this week that it limited distribution of the New York Post's story because of its 2018 policy that ""prohibits the use of our service to distribute content obtained without authorization."" A bogus standard they seem to apply only when it comes to protecting Democratic candidates like Joe Biden from damaging stories -- not the president his family or administration. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER An obvious double standard that illustrates how these social media networks are not the neutral gatekeepers they pretend to be. For example the left-wing New York Times' recent release of President Donald Trump's tax records -- allegedly obtained from hacked and/or unauthorized sources -- was not blocked by Facebook or Twitter. The same is true with the secret recordings of first lady Melania Trump that were deceptively distributed by a former aide yet given free rein by the same networks. Twitter and Facebook allow the hashtag #MelaniaTapes to trend without incident. But a story that dings Joe Biden during a presidential election? That gets aggressive blocking and tackling by Big Tech's henchmen. This shouldn't surprise anyone given the far-left political leanings of those who work in Big Tech including the head of site integrity at Twitter Yoel Roth. In January 2017 Roth compared the Trump administration to Nazis by tweeting: ""Today on Meet the Press we're speaking with Joseph Goebbels about the first 100 days...--What I hear whenever Kellyanne (Conway) is on a news show.""

""We were informed by eyewitnesses that prior to the incident she was feeding the deer. We understand that the woman was not seriously injured and we sincerely hope she is OK"" Richards wrote in a statement shared with Fox News.  “This incident serves as a powerful warning that deer are wild and unpredictable animals and a minimum 50-meter distance must be adhered to at all times. This is especially important as we are in the middle of rutting reason when male deer are flooded with testosterone and adrenaline"" he added. “It’s also important to stress that deer do not require feeding from the public. Both Richmond and Bushy Parks provide ample natural food for deer that is suited to their nutritional needs. By feeding deer you are doing them more harm then good and putting yourself in unnecessary danger at the same time.” The woman in the photo meanwhile was reportedly ridiculed online for getting close to the animal.

When both responded the white instructor clarified “I meant the monkey.” That behavior as alleged in an internal complaint didn’t stop there. The instructor also was accused of going on the loudspeaker in the tower of the outdoor firing range to taunt black trainees by making “monkey noises.” NEW POLL SHOWS MAJORITY OF VOTERS BELIEVE US SOCIETY IS RACIST “We were like ‘It’s 2019. That shouldn’t even be a thing that we’re dealing with’” said Derek Moise who did not hear the noises himself but recalled the discomfort they caused his fellow Black trainees who did. “Everybody knows what those sounds and noises stand for.” As the DEA continues a decades-long struggle to diversify its ranks it has received a string of recent complaints describing a culture of racial discrimination at its training academy in which minorities are singled out derided with insults and consistently held to a higher standard than their white counterparts according to interviews with former recruits and law enforcement officials and records obtained by The Associated Press. In one case a Black recruit was told his skin color made him a surefire candidate for undercover work. In another a Hispanic woman chatting in Spanish with a fellow trainee was admonished to “speak English you are in the United States.” At least two of the complaints prompted internal DEA investigations one of which is ongoing. The complaints which are not typically made public offer a rare window into the frustration minorities have voiced about their treatment at DEA since the filing of a 1977 civil rights lawsuit that remains unresolved despite a series of court orders governing the agency’s hiring and promotion practices. Last year a federal judge ruled that DEA had run afoul of court orders intended to remove subjectivity from agent promotions. YELP FLAGGING BUSINESSES ACCUSED OF RACISM ON ITS REVIEW PLATFORM Like other federal law enforcement agencies including the FBI the DEA has struggled to fill its ranks with minorities. Of the agency’s 4400 special agents just 8% are Black and 10% are Hispanic. The DEA said it could not immediately provide a racial breakdown of recent graduates of the Quantico Virginia academy which puts through multiple classes a year of about 50 to 60 trainees each. “DEA takes allegations of misconduct very seriously and will not tolerate discriminatory behavior of any kind” the agency said in a statement. “DEA is committed to recruiting retaining and promoting a workforce that reflects the diversity of our country and the people we serve.” In the case of the firing range instructor making “monkey noises” at least two Black trainees raised their concerns to a DEA supervisor who sent them up the chain of command prompting Special Agent Jay Mortenson to be removed from his post on the firing range. But to the disappointment of the recruits he was not disciplined before retiring. The DEA told AP the instructor was “promptly reassigned” after agency leadership learned of the alleged “inappropriate behavior.” The agency said it has “no authority to pursue an administrative action” because its internal affairs arm the Office of Professional Responsibility was still investigating when Mortenson retired last year. His retirement ended that probe. Contacted by AP by telephone Mortenson called the allegations “incorrect” but said “I’m not going to talk to you about it” before hanging up. ABC NEWS EXECUTIVE BARBARA FEDIDA FIRED FOLLOWING INVESTIGATION INTO RACIST REMARKS ABOUT BLACK ANCHORS The recruits who originally accused Mortenson are still employed by the DEA and not permitted to speak publicly about the incidents. Former recruits who spoke to AP said racism permeated their time at the academy from their first day of basic training alleging exceptions were routinely made for underperforming white trainees while Blacks were held to an appreciably higher standard. “They weren’t going to let me graduate and become an agent no matter what” said Theo Brown a Black recruit from Marietta Georgia who contends he was unfairly dismissed in early 2018. “They put you in situations where they can fail you at something subjective and it’s basically your word against theirs.” Brown said he was pepper-sprayed three times in a single training exercise while other trainees were sprayed once. It got to the point he said that other trainees didn’t want to work near him because of the “special attention” he was receiving. Academy instructors maintained Brown fell short short in several disciplines citing his “lack of enthusiasm” and issues with his report writing according to DEA records. They denied that discrimination played a role in his dismissal. More recently the DEA opened an internal investigation into claims brought by Saudhy Bliss a Hispanic woman from Orlando Florida who says she was dismissed from the academy last year after being treated in a “hostile manner.” She alleges she was called a “f—-up” in front of her colleagues “required to drag a 220-pound-plus male across a great distance” and even struck in the forehead by a simulation round that caused her to bleed profusely. BARR SAYS HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THERE'S SYSTEMIC RACISM IN US POLICING DEA instructors said Bliss was dismissed for failing handgun qualifications and raid trainings. “There is compelling evidence that a number of the individuals assigned to train this particular class were openly discriminatory towards African-Americans Hispanics and female trainees” Bliss’ attorney Louis F. Robbio wrote in a letter last year to the DEA’s acting administrator referring as well to the incident involving the monkey noises on the firing range. Moise who earned a master’s degree in criminology and played wide receiver at Florida Atlantic University said he wanted to work for the DEA from the time he was 6 years old when he witnessed a drug raid at a neighbor’s home in Miami. “My mom felt that much more comfortable letting me play outside after that” he recalled. “I saw those yellow DEA letters and thought they were the coolest people on Earth.” Moise says he never tried drugs and stayed out of trouble because he always planned to apply for DEA. But from the moment he arrived at the academy he said it was clear he would be judged on a different scale. Moise said he ultimately was dismissed after instructors determined he used excessive force by firing one too many rounds at an assailant during a simulation. At the same time he said the academy graduated white trainees who instead of saving their partner in the same simulation “threw their gun under the bed and just froze.” “There was never any praise for anything that we did as minorities and we were always being made examples of” said Moise who has since taken a state government job. “You can’t tell me that there’s not more Black people who qualify.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP , https://www.foxnews.com/us/dea-recruits-monkey-noises-racism,0.8102988298342957
42,DEA recruits cite ‘monkey noises’ among claims of racism, Matt Ryan understood the need to play better as the Atlanta Falcons started the season with five straight losses firing their coach and general manager and not getting a vote of confidence from the owner. Ryan a one-time NFL MVP who has 1472 passing yards seven touchdown passes and three interceptions this season has seemingly kept his end of the bargain. But team owner Arthur Blank said after the latest personnel moves that he wants the future general manger to give the franchise direction. COWBOYS' DAK PRESCOTT SHARES UPDATE AFTER SURGERY: 'READY TO START THIS ROAD TO COME BACK' “Forever the line in the locker room has been that we rent these lockers” Ryan told reporters Wednesday according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “You have to go out and pay that rent and earn your spot day in and day out. That’s regardless of if you’re in Year 1 or Year 13 or wherever that’s our responsibility as players all of the time to go out there and perform. That’s what we are paid to do.” Atlanta started 1-7 last season but ended up finishing 7-9. Ryan said he realizes what’s at stake after a poor season – a high draft pick that could end up being a franchise-changer. “I can’t worry about that yet” he said. “It’s not like we’re making this transition and it’s the end of December. We’re in the middle of October and we have 11 games in front of us. PREDICT SIX WINNERS WIN $1 MILLION WITH FOX SUPER 6 “Worrying about those things is going to distract us as players from what we need to do. That’s prepare ourselves and get ready for the Minnesota Vikings this weekend. I’m sure that they are not all that concerned with how we are going to rebuild or restructure our organization moving forward. They are trying to get a win this Sunday.” Ryan has not thrown a touchdown pass since the Falcons played the Chicago Bears on Sept. 27. Of course not having Julio Jones hurts but the wide receiver hasn’t been the healthiest in the last few years of his career.

43,Falcons' Matt Ryan addresses challenges ahead after team's personnel shakeup," ""Mr. Chairman I just want to thank you"" Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein told committee Chairman Lindsey Graham on Thursday. ""This has been one of the best Senate hearings that I've participated in and I want to thank you for your fairness and the opportunity of going back and forth."" Graham R-S.C. replied: ""I know we have very different views about the judge and whether we should be doing this or not. But having said all that to my Democratic colleagues you have challenged the judge you have challenged us and I accept those challenges as being sincere and not personal."" Graham then ended the hearing and he and Feinstein D-Calif. hugged -- an ending that was a stark contrast to the 2018 hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The moment followed four days of contentious but largely civilized hearings. There was partisan grandstanding and electioneering as can be expected when lawmakers are given four full business days on national television. There were warnings from Democrats that Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett is a threat to Roe v. Wade and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). And there were lamentations from Republicans about the fact Democratic presidential and vice-presidential nominees Joe Biden and Kamala Harris respectively still won't tell voters whether they'll pack the Supreme Court.  SENATORS CLASH AT BARRETT CONFIRMATION HEARINGS AS DEMS ATTEMPT PROCEDURAL ROADBLOCKS GOP FORGES AHEAD But Republicans' predictions that Democrats would attack the nominee's religion never materialized at least in the hearings. And Democrats failed to strike any major blows to Barrett's confirmation prospects before the representatives of the nonpartisan American Bar Association (ABA) appeared to discuss their ""Well Qualified"" rating of Barrett relaying descriptions of the federal judge as ""brilliant"" ""forthright"" and an ""intellectual giant."" Feinstein herself at one point Wednesday even told Barrett ""I'm really impressed thank you"" in response to a description of the legal principles she would have to take into account in an upcoming constitutional challenge to the ACA. All of this was a sharp contrast from the 2018 confirmation hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh which were marred with bombastic behavior from senators regular interruptions from protesters threats to lawmakers and lurid sexual assault accusations pushed against the nominee. Lawyer Michael Avenatti who has since been convicted of attempted extortion did not make an appearance this week.  Any winners of the hearings -- besides Barrett for coming through unscathed and the American people for getting a civil and largely substantive hearing for their potential Supreme Court justice -- are unclear. ABA BARRETT ALLIES LAUD NOMINEE AS 'BRILLIANT' AS DEMOCRAT WITNESSES WARN OF 'REAL-WORLD HARM' IF CONFIRMED Republicans can't cut ads hammering Democrats for misbehavior during the hearings or trying to assassinate the character of the nominee for political reasons. Although not always in context or accurate Democrats' attacks on Barrett were largely on her past rulings and political stances.  And Democrats can't hammer Republicans for forcing through the nominee without a thorough examination of her credentials or giving Democrats enough time to ask their questions. Although Graham will have to push the nominee out of committee over Democratic boycotts objecting to the timing of the process he made clear he's giving Democrats ""the time you need to make your case"" and that ""Judge Barrett is required for the good of the country to submit to your questions and ours."" This was done over the objections of President Trump who in a Monday tweet encouraged Republicans to stop ""giving the Democrats a great deal of time which is not mandated."" LIBERAL GROUP CALLS FOR FEINSTEIN TO STAND DOWN FROM JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ROLE AFTER GRAHAM HUG Not everyone was impressed with the show of civility from both sides however. Left-wing group Demand Justice which reflexively opposes all Trump judicial nominees with apocalyptic rhetoric called on Feinstein to step down from her post as Judiciary Committee ranking member over her hug of Graham.  ""It's time for Sen. Feinstein to step down from her leadership position on the Senate Judiciary Committee. If she won't her colleagues need to intervene"" the group said in a statement. ""She has undercut Democrats' position at every step of this process from undermining calls for filibuster and Court reform straight through to thanking Republicans form the most egregious partisan power grab in the modern history of the Supreme Court."" Justice Democrats the group that backs primary challenges to Democrat incumbents and helped Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez D-N.Y. make it to Congress in 2018 also weighed in. ""Dianne Feinstein must step down"" it said quote-tweeting a post by Demand Justice Executive Director Brian Fallon that said the same thing. But despite consternation from the left wing of the Democratic Party and barring any post-hearing developments -- the Kavanaugh sexual assault accusations came out after his first time before the Senate panel leading to yet more hearings -- the status quo was not changed and Republicans appear to have the votes to get Barrett's confirmation across the finish line before the month is out.  ""I think that the hearings went well for Judge Barrett. When she answered questions her responses were generally clear and articulate and she displayed a broad command of constitutional law and statutory interpretation"" said Carl Tobias a professor and judicial selection expert at the University of Richmond School of Law. ""Moreover she seemed respectful of senators even when they asked questions that may have been out of bounds or seemed to be grandstanding or trying to profit politically from the hearings."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Tobias added: ""In short Barrett did what she needed to do and the panel is likely to have a 12-10 party-line vote."" Graham scheduled the committee vote on Barrett for 1 p.m. on Oct. 22 and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. has said he will introduce Barrett's nomination on the Senate floor the following day before confirming her within the next three or four days during which senators will have time to debate on the floor.  This would be consistent with Graham's prediction on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" ahead of the hearings that Barrett will be confirmed ""no later than Tuesday a week before the election."" That would be Oct. 27.  Fox News' Marisa Schultz Ronn Blitzer Chad Pergram and Jason Donner contributed to this report.  ", https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barrett-confirmation-battle-civil-graham-feinstein-kavanaugh,0.8103430688107646

45,Jimmy Kimmel pays tribute to Regis Philbin ahead of ‘Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?’ premiere," President Trump tweeted an article from the satirical website Babylon Bee on Friday morning that claimed Twitter shut down the entire network to slow down spread of negative news about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.   It’s unclear if the president was aware that the Babylon Bee is a satirical site but the tweet came after a bizarre 48 hours in which both Twitter and Facebook came under fire for censoring New York Post stories that were damning for Biden. Twitter also faced technical difficulties Thursday as users complained that their accounts were down on both computers and mobile devices.  FACEBOOK AND TWITTER REDUCING DISTRIBUTION OF NEW YORK POST HUNTER BIDEN STORY “Wow this has never been done in history. This includes his really bad interview last night. Why is Twitter doing this. Bringing more attention to Sleepy Joe &amp; Big T” Trump wrote to caption the article headline “Twitter Shuts Down Entire Network To Slow Spread Of Negative Biden News.”   While the Babylon Bee headline coincides with many people pondering if the Twitter malfunction that actually occurred had anything to do with the measures it took to suppress the report from Post revealing emails that purportedly show a connection to Hunter Biden his business contacts in Ukraine and his father – the satirical article took things a step further.   “After seeing account after account tweet out one particularly bad story CEO Jack Dorsey realized he had to take action. Dorsey smashed a glass box in his office reading ‘Break In Case Of Bad Publicity For Democrats.’ Inside the case was a sledgehammer for smashing Twitter's servers” the Babylon Bee wrote. ""Red alert -- shut the servers down! Shut them all down!""  TWITTER HIT WITH 'SERVICE DISRUPTION' AFTER SUPPRESSING HUNTER BIDEN REPORT  The satirical site then joked that Dorsey “ran downstairs and started smashing as many computers as he could but he did need to ask for some help as the hammer was pretty heavy. None of the programmers could lift the hammer either.”  Comments on Trump’s tweet were mixed with many people claiming he knew it was satire and others blasting the president for tweeting fictitious information.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump later added “Big T was not a reference to me but rather to Big Tech which should have been properly pointed out in Twitter’s Fake Trending Section!”  Meanwhile Republican Sens. Ted Cruz Lindsey Graham and Josh Hawley on Thursday called on the heads of Twitter and Facebook to testify about alleged social media censorship and said a subpoena was in the works as critics claimed the social media platforms have been suppressing reports critical of Democrats.

Bonhams expected it to sell for as much as $500000 at the event.

48,Lincoln Continental JFK rode in on day of death sold for $375G, The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) raised a massive $247.8 million in September an impressive haul as the 2020 cycle hit its final stretch -- though still short of his Democratic rival Joe Biden who raked in $383 million in the same time period. “President Trump hits final stretch with strength resources record &amp; huge ground game needed to spread message and secure re-election” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh tweeted late Thursday. BIDEN ONCE AGAIN SHATTERS FUNDRAISING RECORD WITH EYE-POPPING $383 MILLION HAUL LAST MONTH The Trump campaign the Republican National Committee and its joint-fundraising committees brought in $247.8 million in September and combined have a whopping $251.4 million cash on hand. “POTUS has done more in 47 months than Biden in 47 years” Murtaugh added. But the Biden campaign and Democrats earlier this week announced their fundraising numbers revealing they out-raised Trump and Republicans bringing in $383 million in September. “To every person who chipped in a few dollars last month — thank you. Because of your support we raised an astounding $383 million. I'm incredibly humbled” Biden tweeted. “That’s more than I’ve ever raised in my whole life… I’m really humbled by it” Biden added in a video in which he announced the news to one of his supporters a special education teacher who lives in Harrisburg Pa. Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon announced on Twitter that the Biden campaign and the DNC entered October with an eye-popping $432 million cash on hand. That’s down slightly from the $466 million they had in the bank at the beginning of September as the Biden campaign continues to spend tens of millions of dollars each week to run ads on TV radio and digital in the key general election battleground states and on national broadcast and cable networks. TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAYS CASH NOT AN ISSUE 'DOWN THE STRETCH' Touting the campaign’s low-dollar donations Dillon said that “Our success has been driven by our grassroots supporters. $203 million came from online donors. We had 1.1 million new donors last month — bringing the total to 5.5 million donors throughout this campaign.” The Biden campaign also outraised Team Trump in August touting $364.5 million raised while the Trump campaign brought in $210 million during the same period.  But at the time a senior Trump campaign official told Fox News that Trump was out-raised in 2016 by then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton who brought in $1.2 billion to his $646 million (including some of Trump's own money). “We had the better candidate the better message and better grassroots enthusiasm then just like we do now” the official told Fox News. “Biden needs this money because we had such an enormous head start on him.” Fox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.  , https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-campaign-september-fundraising-still-short-biden-haul,0.8101755506392723

""This culminated on Thursday October 8th when I heard President Trump go on national television twice and falsely attack me by name.

The day after Scully tweeted at Scaramucci C-SPAN issued a statement saying Scully ""did not originate the tweet"" in question. The statement added that the CPD was investigating the incident ""with the help of authorities.""  CPD later stated ""it had reported the apparent hack to the FBI and Twitter"" as part of its investigation.

He is having a hard enough time. Some more bad stuff about to go down."" Scaramucci told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade last week that he thought Scully's tweet was real prompting his own response.

51,College Football Week 7 preview: Coronavirus postponed at least 3 big games as some schools face test, A man described by U.S. prosecutors as a neo-Nazi and white supremacist pleaded guilty on Thursday to a hate crime for plotting to bomb a historic Colorado synagogue last year. Richard Holzer 28 pleaded guilty to attempting to stop people from exercising their religion with an explosive or fire and attempting to destroy a building used in interstate commerce in a plea deal with prosecutors. MICHIGAN MAN CHARGED WITH FEDERAL HATE CRIME AFTER ATTACKING BLACK TEEN WITH BIKE LOCK: PROSECUTORS While each of the two crimes carries a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison prosecutors in return promised not to ask a judge to impose a sentence of more than 20 years when Holzer is sentenced Jan. 21. Holzer was arrested Nov. 1 2019 after receiving phony pipe bombs and dynamite from undercover FBI agents he had been meeting with. One agent posing as a white supremacist had reached out to him online after seeing Holzer’s social media posts promoting white supremacy and violence according to the facts agreed to by both sides as part of the plea deal. As he accepted the fake explosives hours before he planned to use them at Pueblo’s Temple Emanuel synagogue Holzer displaying a Nazi armband and carrying a copy of “Mein Kampf” in his backpack the plea deal said. Holzer also allegedly thanked the agents for their efforts and called the planned attack a “move for our race” the document said. 'CRYING NAZI' CHRISTOPHER CANTWELL CONVICTED IN RAPE THREAT EXTORTION CASE After his arrest Holzer told police that he did not plan to hurt anyone by bombing the synagogue in the middle of the night but acknowledged he would have gone ahead with his plan if the building had been occupied because anyone there would be Jewish the plea deal document said. The Temple Emanuel is the second oldest synagogue in Colorado. It was built in 1900 largely by descendants of immigrants from central and eastern Europe. In a statement about the deal Colorado U.S. Attorney Jason Dunn called the law enforcement effort on the case “the most important work that we can do – protecting our communities by stopping an attack before it occurred.” Holzer’s guilty plea is a reminder that hate crimes will not be tolerated in the state Scott Levin the director of the Anti-Defamation League Mountain States Region said.

52,Alleged neo-Nazi pleads guilty in Colorado synagogue plot," Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden conceded Thursday it was a ""mistake"" to support a now-controversial crime bill that critics say laid the groundwork for mass incarceration but the former longtime senator still defended parts of the 1994 legislation.   Asked by ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos during a televised town hall in Philadelphia whether supporting the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act was a mistake Biden said: ""Yes it was.""  But the former vice president blamed the worst effects of the law on how individual states chose to implement it.  BIDEN'S COURT-PACKING 180 SAYS HE WILL NOW TELL VOTERS HIS STANCE BEFORE ELECTION ""Here's where the mistake came"" he said. ""The mistake came in terms of what the states did locally. What we did federally — you remember George it was all about the same time for the same crime."" He also defended the legislation as indicative of its time noting it had the support of the Congressional Black Caucus and Black mayors across the country. Still he acknowledged the country's attitude on racial justice issues has shifted dramatically since President Bill Clinton signed the law.  “Things have changed” he said. BIDEN PRESSED ON 'YOU AIN'T BLACK' COMMENT DURING TOWN HALL The candidate has previously said elements of the legislation were a ""big mistake"" because of its effect on the Black community.  Biden's comments come amid a reckoning in the U.S. on racial justice following a summer of protests over police brutality against Black Americans.  President Trump has repeatedly tried to tie Biden to unrest in American cities -- which began in the spring following the death of George Floyd a Black man while in custody of a Minneapolis police officer -- and to the ""defund the police"" movement a push to reallocate funds from police departments toward other government programs intended to reduce crime and expand social welfare. BIDEN SAID IT'S 'ABSOLUTELY' OK TO RAISE TAXES DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURN ""He's talking about defunding the police"" Trump said during the first presidential debate. ""He doesn't have any law support. He has no law enforcement support."" A group of more than 175 current and former law enforcement officials endorsed Biden at the beginning of September calling Trump ""lawless."" Biden has repeatedly distanced himself from defunding the police and has instead called for reforms to law enforcement like giving additional funding for community policing. He pushed back against Trump's criticisms. “Yes I’m in favor of law and order"" he said one month ago. ""Law and order with justice where people get treated fairly.""

53,Biden calls supporting 1994 crime bill a 'mistake' during ABC town hall," President Trump on Friday said convincing Republican Sen. Susan Collins to vote in favor of his Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett is “not worth the work” noting that the senator from Maine has not supported him on other issues in the past. “There is a nasty rumor out there that @SenatorCollins of Maine will not be supporting our great United States Supreme Court nominee” Trump tweeted Friday. “Well she didn’t support Healthcare or my opening up 5000 square miles of Ocean to Maine so why should this be any different.” He added: “Not worth the work!” The president’s comments come as Collins has maintained that she will not vote to confirm Barrett so close to the election. “It’s no comment on her it’s a comment on the process of rushing through a nomination in such a short time before a presidential election” Collins has said. Collins 67 who has served in the Senate since 1997 is among a handful of Republican senators occasionally willing to break rank with her party.  Her crucial vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in 2018 angered many progressive women across the country who opposed his nomination because of sexual assault allegations. Many Mainers are determined to unseat her. Collins is up for reelection on Nov. 3 and is in a tight battle with polls showing her opponent Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon in the lead.  Meanwhile Sen. Lisa Murkowski R-Ak. has not revealed how she will vote though previously said she “would not support” the Senate taking up a potential Supreme Court nominee before the election. ROMNEY SAYS HE WILL VOTE TO CONFIRM AMY CONEY BARRETT Collins and Murkowski as well as Senate Democrats have objected to a confirmation so close to the election citing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s refusal to consider President Barack Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland in 2016. McConnell R-Ky. has said that the present situation is different because the White House and the Senate are not held by opposing parties. Republicans though appear to have the votes to move forward and confirm Barrett. Republicans have 53 votes in the Senate and can therefore afford three defections if no Democrat votes for the nominee. In that instance Vice President Mike Pence would be called in to break a tie. On Wednesday Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said he will vote to confirm Barrett to the Supreme Court after being the lone Republican to vote to convict President Trump during the impeachment hearings.  GRAHAM SAYS 'NOTHING UNCONSTITUTIONAL' ABOUT AMY CONEY BARRETT CONFIRMATION DESPITE DEM ARGUMENTS “After meeting with Judge Barrett and carefully reviewing her record and her testimony I intend to vote in favor of her confirmation to the Supreme Court"" Romney said in a statement released Thursday. ""She is impressive and her distinguished legal and academic credentials make it clear that she is exceptionally well qualified to serve as our next Supreme Court justice.”  He added: “I am confident that she will faithfully apply the law and our Constitution impartially and regardless of policy preferences.” ", https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-susan-collins-amy-coney-barrett-confirmation,0.8103459897276312

In a new report by The Hollywood Reporter Columbia Crandell Tunisha Singleton and Jessica Morse are speaking out and claiming they were victims of sexual misconduct retaliation and wrongful termination at Vin di Bona Productions the company which produces ""AFV."" Crandell 25 alleges a male superior tried to take a picture up her skirt while in his office to test out a virtual reality (VR) headset. After she brought the complaint to her managers Crandell claims her income was reduced from a salary to hourly pay. She also filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department in 2018. The incident was investigated but the District Attorney's Office declined to prosecute.  ROSE MCGOWAN SUPPORTS CHARLOTTE KIRK AMID SEXUAL MISCONDUCT LAWSUIT WITH WARNER BROS Tunisha Singleton 37 claims she was at a workplace comedy event with 50 other people when a superior started making jokes about Singleton “doing blow in the bathroom"" and allegedly referred to her as a ""crack whore."" “I was completely mortified” she said. Singleton was laid off soon after that and claims it was because she didn't take the jokes well. According to THR on Singleton's last day other employees received an email about participating in a harassment prevention training program. The third woman Jessica Morse 24 says she was at the comedy event and voiced her concern about the actions that took place. 'ELLEN DEGENERES SHOW' ‘PARTED WAYS’ WITH 3 EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS IN THE WAKE OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS In a meeting with supervisors she claims they told her: ""'Well you can’t always trust people. We’ve hired the best investigation team in America.' And then they said over and over ‘If you say something about someone and it turns out not to be true you can be legally responsible.’” Morse resigned but wasn't allowed to finish out her last two weeks.  “It was so predatory to take advantage of people who desperately need jobs desperately need to get a start” Morse continued to the outlet. “They trust the name of a family TV institution AFV. And they think that we’re not going to fight for ourselves. They think we’re not going to stand up for ourselves. They think we’re not going to expect any rights.” In 2019 the three filed a civil lawsuit against Vin Di Bona Productions and its digital arm FishBowl Worldwide Media as ""Jane Roes."" The plaintiffs alleged they were victims of ""workplace racial and sexual harassment"" according to THR.  Representatives for ""AFV"" did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. An attorney for Vin di Bona Productions told Fox News in a statement on Friday: ""Vin Di Bona Productions has taken these allegations very seriously from the moment they were raised two years ago. The company immediately retained an external expert conducted a thorough investigation and implemented numerous protocols aimed at ensuring a safe equitable and non-discriminatory workplace."" The statement noted that ""the investigation revealed no evidence of wrongdoing at the time."" ""We believe a swift resolution of this case is in the best interest of all parties who have been impacted and we have been attempting to do just that since the claims were made"" the statement added. ""We encourage the plaintiffs’ counsel to allow the legal process to proceed efficiently and move to the merits."" ACTOR BRYAN CALLEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY MULTIPLE WOMEN In addition an attorney for the production company also told THR in a statement: ""The physical emotional and psychological safety of our employees is always our highest priority. When accusations are made we like any responsible organization have an obligation to act swiftly thoughtfully and respectfully to support the well-being and rights of all parties involved."" Meanwhile the attorney for the three women Barbara Cowan told Fox News ""The survivors in this case have requested that the Court of Appeal vacate the order to compel arbitration. It is important that survivors of sexual assault sexual harassment and racial discrimination do not feel thrust into the shadows of the secret world of arbitration.  Only when secrecy stops can healing begin."" Cowan added ""I would also note that we have heard from now 5 other survivors since the article came out regarding sexual and racial harassment at VDB/Fishbowl.""

Attorney John Burris said in a news conference Thursday that Cameron Ely never claimed to have a gun before deputies opened fire in the 2019 confrontation. He said Cameron Ely surrendered with his hands up. An investigation found that Cameron Ely 30 stabbed his mother 62-year-old Valerie Lundeen Ely to death before he was shot outside his father’s home in Hope Ranch a suburb of luxury homes outside Santa Barbara.

But Burris said the deputies “engaged in the unjustified use of deadly force.” “If he didn’t have a gun or he didn’t have a weapon what was the basis of shooting him?” Burris said. “They may have very well thought he was involved in some other activity involving the mom.

64,Ron Ely challenges Santa Barbara district attorney after fatal shooting of his son deemed 'justifiable', The FDA said it will require common pain reliever medicines to change their labels to reflect warnings for women who are 20 weeks or later into pregnancy bumping up the previously established warnings by a month. The regulatory agency said taking these nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at 20 weeks gestation or later in the pregnancy can cause rare but serious kidney problems in the unborn baby leading to low levels of amniotic fluid and possible pregnancy-related complications. HAVING A BABY LATER IN LIFE MAY INCREASE LONGEVITY STUDY SUGGESTS The medications that require these updated changes include ibuprofen naproxen diclofenac and celecoxib which are offered in both prescription and over-the-counter form. They are most commonly used to treat fever colds muscle aches and pain. The changes reflect a change in policy which previously warned women to avoid taking these medications during the last three months of pregnancy.   Low-dose aspirin however will not be included in the changes as it may be “an important treatment for some women during pregnancy” and should be taken under the direction of health care provider according to the FDA. PREGNANT WOMAN BATTLES BREAST CANCER UNDERGOES CHEMO DOUBLE MASTECTOMY  “It is important that women understand the benefits and risks of the medications they may take over the course of their pregnancy” Patrizia Cavazzoni M.D. acting director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research said in a news release posted Thursday. “To this end the agency is using its regulatory authority to inform women and their health care providers about the risks if NSAIDs are used after around 20 weeks of pregnancy and beyond.”   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The changes come after the FDA received 35 reports of a decrease in amniotic fluid related to taking NSAIDs. The agency said some cases saw the use of the pain relievers reduce amniotic fluid in as little as two days although the problem typically reversed itself three to six days after the women stopped taking the medicines according to the Associated Press. , https://www.foxnews.com/health/pregnancy-warning-extended-common-pain-relievers-fda,0.8103099243448285
65,Pregnancy warning extended for common pain relievers FDA says," Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said he plans to activate the Wisconsin National Guard to make up for poll worker shortages in dozens of municipalities across the state. “The Guard will play a role as much as they are needed"" Evers said. TRUMP STUMPING IN FLORIDA GEORGIA AS BIDEN HEADS TO MICHIGAN AFTER COMPETING TOWN HALLS Wisconsin -- a battleground state that President Trump won by less than a percentage point in 2016 -- is relatively well prepared less than two weeks away from Election Day. Despite surging cases of coronavirus that have shattered records in recent weeks only about 180 poll workers more are needed out of 30000 that staff polling sites in 51 municipalities the Wisconsin Elections Commission said on Thursday. The shortage is far less than during the state's primaries in August when polling sites were lacking 700 workers forcing some centers to close. The coronavirus crisis coupled with fewer polling sites at that time saw long wait times for voters causing concerns of lower turnout.  FIRST PRESIDENTIAL VOTE CAST USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY The largest shortfalls are in Green Bay where 30 workers were needed and in Menomonie in the western part of the state near Minnesota where there was a shortage of 15. Watertown City Clerk Elissa Friedl said Thursday that she had just asked the elections commission to remove her city from the list because she was confident all 100 people needed to work the polls on Election Day would be available.  Even if people back out close to the election Friedl said she has city employees at the ready to fill vacancies. Watertown has about 24000 residents and is located midway between Madison and Milwaukee. “Clerks are doing a good job of recruiting and Wisconsin citizens are stepping up in response to either calls to action or problems that occurred in April” Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesman Reid Magney said according to the Associated Press. MAN WHO FIRED SHOTS BEFORE KYLE RITTENHOUSE IN KENOSHA CHARGED Election officials advocacy groups and others in Wisconsin and across the country have been recruiting poll workers more aggressively this year because older volunteers have been backing out due to concerns over the coronavirus.  A record-high number of Wisconsin voters are also casting absentee ballots which election officials say should cut down on lines on Election Day as well. As of Thursday more than 785000 voters had returned absentee ballots. That is more than 26% of the total number who voted in the 2016 presidential election.

The plaintiff is Cynthia Donald who was Johnson’s personal driver when he was on the job. Donald has been a Chicago cop for 14 years and says in the lawsuit Johnson forced her to engage in sex acts to keep her job. “After the first time he sexually assaulted me in his office at CPD headquarters he told me that I belonged to him” Donald told a news conference Thursday according to Fox 32 Chicago.

The two competitors have only gone head-to-head as starters twice in their career and will meet for a third time Sunday. But it appears the two have a rivalry on the golf course.

70,Broncos use viral Peyton Manning photo to take playful jab at Tom Brady, America was treated to two different town halls Thursday night featuring Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and President Trump on different networks. Why weren't the two candidates appearing on stage together you ask just 19 days before the election? Because the Commission on Presidential Debates decided last week it wasn’t safe to debate in person. Apparently nobody told NBC's Town Hall moderator Savannah Guthrie who couldn’t have fought President Trump any harder on Thursday night if she were at the top of the Democratic ticket.  Guthrie’s constant interruptions stood in stark contrast to the spa treatment Joe Biden received from ABC moderator George Stephanopolous who couldn’t have made the Biden family feel more comfortable if he gave him a hot towel and spoke Ukrainian. (I hope you enjoyed that line because I’ll probably get banned from Twitter for it.) DAN GAINOR: TRUMP’S NBC TOWN HALL TURNS INTO DEBATE WITH MODERATOR — AND TRUMP WINS Let the record show that on a night when President Trump was asked about QAnon an internet conspiracy many people have heard of but few can explain his rival didn’t face a single question about his son’s business dealings in Ukraine which happens to be one of the biggest stories in the country despite the efforts of the big tech oligarchs to suppress it.  I’m not saying the Hunter Biden emails are true because I have no way of knowing at this juncture. But show me a man who thinks the candidates received equal treatment and I’ll show you a way to take away his car keys for everyone’s safety. Much can be said about the contrasting style of the moderators on Thursday night but what really jumped out at me was the contrasting leadership styles of the candidates and their dueling visions for our country.  Trump comes off as a street fighter whose nose for conflict has been hardened by four years of incessant attacks from a media hellbent on stopping his presidency at all costs. Biden has the auto-pilot charm of a lifelong politician. He campaigns like he’s not interested in fighting for anything other than the TV remote when he’s home on the plastic-covered couch with Jill.  Trump pushes American excellence at every turn as he did again Thursday night in touting the record-breaking unemployment numbers we enjoyed pre-pandemic for people of every socio economic background. Biden pushes systemic racism and class warfare as he did in calling out America’s troubled history with race and vowing to increase taxes on the rich yet again. In short these Town Hall events made it abundantly clear that 2020 is a choice between VICTOR-HOOD or VICTIM-HOOD. The Republicans unapologetically call this the greatest country the world has ever known. They rightfully point out that we live in an age where everyone can flourish through hard work thanks to the spectacular upward mobility in our society. No we’re not perfect. Yes we’ve made immense progress in the last 50 years we should continue to build on.  The Democrats devoted their entire presidential election cycle to telling us the rich have stacked the deck against us and the whole country is racist. If you believe this is true you have to wonder why it took their candidate 47 years to realize it. But any way you slice it the left is constantly scolding us for the America we were instead of giving us credit for all the work we’ve done to become the America we are.  For all the hysterical claims that President Trump poses an existential threat to our country a Gallup poll released last week shows that 56% of Americans consider themselves better off now than they were four years ago compared to 45% of American who felt that way at the end of Barack Obama’s first term.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER When confronted with these findings during a campaign stop in Cincinnati Biden said voters who feel that way “should probably vote for Trump” adding “well their memory is not very good quite frankly.”  Now to be fair if anybody knows about having a bad memory it’s a presidential nominee who’s told people he’s running for Senate on multiple occasions.  But Biden’s dismissive attitude towards the facts is emblematic of the left’s entire approach to fighting this president: push his rhetoric over his record.  They continue to run this exhausted play because while the president throws tons of wild rhetorical pitches he’s had no problem finding the strike zone with his pro-growth agenda.  Not only did he slash regulations at a staggering pace to get the bureaucratic boot off the neck of small businesses but he cut taxes for 80% of Americans with the biggest benefits being felt by women and minorities at the lowest end of the economic scale.  Recently released Data from the Census Bureau shows that real median household income increased by $4400 in 2019 which represents a 6.8% one-year increase - the largest one year increase on record! Those those gains have been highest for minority groups with real median income growing by 7.9 percent for Black Americans 7.1 percent for Hispanic Americans and 10.6 percent for Asian Americans. The pandemic induced lockdowns have driven down economic data in 2020. Even so our unemployment rate has already dropped from 14.7% in April to the current rate of 7.9% which is where it stood at the end of Barack Obama’s second term.  They’ll be plenty of character assassinations and bombshell reports between now and November 3. Some of them will even be allowed to run on Twitter.  But the real contrast facing voters as America picks itself up off the mat after a vicious right hook from the coronavirus is this:  Do we want a president who campaigns relentlessly and never stops pushing an empowering message of American greatness?  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Or do we want a president who’s spent the vast majority of this campaign letting the media fight his defeatist race-baiting “battle for the soul of our nation.”  I for one  think the choice couldn’t be clearer because if Thursday night’s town halls showed us anything it’s that the media can’t be counted on to do its job let alone a president’s.

73,Seattle-area man infected with coronavirus twice, Florida Republicans have cut the voter registration gap with Democrats to a historic low giving the GOP a boost during early voting.  Politico reported Thursday night that the difference in registration numbers for voters in the battleground state is the lowest in at least three decades. TRUMP CAMPAIGN BANKING ON RURAL FLORIDA VOTERS TO REPEAT 2016 SUCCESS Republicans now trail Democrats by just 134242 registered voters down from 327483 in 2016.  Four years ago President Trump won the Sunshine State by fewer than 113000 votes. The gain is purportedly the result of the Trump campaign's in-person canvassing and voter registration operation. The campaign went door-to-door in Florida despite health restrictions and the threat of the coronavirus pandemic. Politico noted that the two parties are statistically almost evenly matched when it comes to raw numbers. Democrats hold a narrow 1% lead and final voter registration data released by Florida election officials on Thursday show 5.3 million Democrats 5.1 million Republicans and 3.7 million people with no major party affiliation. In recent weeks Democrats in Florida have focused on increasing vote-by-mail turnout assisting them in clinching 430000 more votes than Republicans. Alternatively President Trump has warned American voters against voting by mail citing the potential of widespread fraud -- which experts say is unlikely.  Republicans are expected to turn out mainly on Election Day -- something the president is banking on to counter Democrats' massive early voting numbers. Although Democrat Joe Biden's campaign has said it has no regrets about going virtual others in the Democratic Party remain worried about the shift. While face-to-face registration activities are limited for the Florida Democratic Party outside groups like Forward Florida Action have continued to register voters. Democrats have also zeroed in on low-propensity voters and of the 2 million votes cast in Florida so far the party has banked 113000 more ballots than Republicans from residents who didn't vote four years ago. In the days before the state's Oct. 5 registration deadline Florida Republicans whittled down the Democratic advantage by more than 50000.

She said there are about 11 vaccines worldwide in late-stage testing and another 200 candidates under development. “People tend to think ‘Ah on the first of January or the first of April I’m going to get the vaccine and then things will be back to normal’” Swaminathan said. “It’s not going to work like that because no one has ever produced vaccines in these volumes that are going to be needed.” CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE She said the WHO has a group called the strategic advisory group of experts on immunization (SAGE) which recently released a document to guide countries on determining prioritization of vaccines. “I think most people agree that the people at highest risk of both transmission getting the disease and getting sick from it are health care workers frontline workers and then the elderly and the vulnerable” she said. CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN Countries should start preparing a distribution plan and determine how vaccines will be delivered through the health system she continued adding that she expects a lot of guidance still to come out. “A healthy young person might have to wait until 2022 to get a vaccine but by that time hopefully we can stem the acute impacts reduce mortality protect those who are at highest risk. Start solving the acute problems and then we start by protecting the larger percentage of the population.” Maria Van Kerkhove WHO’s COVID-19 technical lead emphasized the importance of vaccinating those at highest risk in all countries first instead of vaccinating everyone in a single country.

75,Healthy young people may wait for coronavirus vaccine until 2022 WHO official says, U.K. regulators fined Heineken’s pub business nearly $2.6 million for allegedly forcing British bars to sell “unreasonable levels” of the Dutch brewer’s beers. Star Pubs &amp; Bars “seriously and repeatedly” violated U.K. rules over a nearly three-year period by keeping an iron grip on pub owners who tried to exercise their right to serve products from different brewers the British Pubs Code Adjudicator said Thursday. Star — which operates Heineken’s U.K. pub arm — told 96 tenants who asked to offer competing brands that every drop of keg beer they sold had to be from a Heineken label officials said. That was despite a legal requirement that pub “stocking terms” can’t stop an operator from selling competitors’ brands. Star later changed its approach and allowed pub operators to offer competing beers while requiring them to sell certain “must stock” brands according to regulators. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER But some tenants still would have been forced to make 60 percent of their keg products Heineken brands within a year even though they sold little or no Heineken products at the time they asked to offer other brands according to officials. Star “did not engage frankly and transparently with its tenants or meet the standards required of a regulated business when engaging with” pub regulators Pubs Code Adjudicator Fiona Dickie said in a statement adding that the fine of 2 million British pounds would be a “deterrent to future non-compliant conduct.” Star said it was “deeply disappointed and frustrated” with the regulators’ findings and said it is considering an appeal.

78,The most stolen vehicle in America is this pickup," Two of the questioners at the ABC town hall featuring Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Thursday had ties to high-profile Democrats including one questioner who previously worked as a speechwriter in the Obama administration.  The queries came as President Trump hundreds of miles away was engaging in his own parallel town hall being aired on NBC. The ABC town hall was hosted by George Stephanopoulos who was a communications director for the Bill Clinton White House and who has been a political journalist since 2002.  One of the questioners at the ABC-hosted event was Nathan Osburn a former speechwriter for the Obama White House. Osburn specifically worked for the Office of Public Affairs at the Commerce Department under the Obama-Biden administration and at the Small Business Administration.  BIDEN MOVES ON COURT PACKING STANCE WHILE TRUMP SPARS WITH NBC IN DUELING TOWN HALLS Osburn's profession was listed as ""communications"" on the ABC town hall graphic and his city was listed as Philadelphia Pennsylvania.  Osburn was quoted in the Philadelphia Inquirer earlier this year as ""a former Obama administration speechwriter"" who had created a ""Philly for Pete group"" aimed at boosting former Democratic presidential primary candidate Pete Buttigieg. And the LGBTQ Victory Institute listed Osburn as a senior speechwriter for the Small Business Administration in an article praising the Obama-Biden administration for its LGBTQ hiring practices.  ""Amy Coney Barrett's being pushed through at the last minute even though millions have already voted. So what do you think about ideas from people like Pete Buttigieg and others to put in place safeguards that will help ensure more long-term balance and stability?"" Osburn asked Biden. ""And what do you say to LGBTQ Americans and others who are very worried right now about erosions of their rights and our democracy as a whole?"" Biden during the exchange that followed that question was asked point-blank by Stephanopoulos whether voters deserve to know his stance on court-packing and Biden reversed his previous stance of refusing to say what that position is before Election Day. He told the moderator that he would take a specific stand on that issue depending on how Republicans handle the ongoing confirmation effort of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.  Another questioner at the town hall was Mieke Haeck who ABC presented as a physical therapist from State College Pa. 'UNDECIDED VOTERS' AT NBC'S BIDEN TOWN HALL WERE FEATURED ON MSNBC AS BIDEN VOTERS Haeck is also the wife of Ezra Nanes a high-profile Democrat in Pennsylvania who in 2018 ran a campaign challenging Republican state Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman. Nanes is currently an at-large member of the Centre County Democratic Committee. Centre County is the county in which State College resides.  ""My youngest daughter is transgender. The Trump administration has attacked the rights of transgender people banning them from military service weakening nondiscrimination protections and even removing the word 'transgender' from some government websites"" Haeck said. ""How will you as president reverse this dangerous and discriminatory agenda and ensure that the lives and rights of LGBTQ people are protected under U.S. law?"" ""I will flat out just change the law"" Biden responded.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Democrat-tied questioners at the ABC town hall follow controversy earlier this month surrounding a Biden town hall held on NBC which on Thursday was carrying the forum with Trump.  The Washington Free Beacon reported on Oct. 6 that two attendees who were identified as undecided voters at an NBC town hall with Biden had previously been shown on NBC's sister network MSNBC as Biden supporters.  When reached for comment about the participants with Democratic ties ABC News directed Fox News to comments made by Stephanopoulos at the beginning of the event.   ""And they're a group of -- some are voting for [Biden] some have said they're voting for President Trump some are still undecided and we're going to try to take questions from as many as we can tonight"" Stephanopoulos told viewers.   ABC News declined additional comment.  Fox News reached out to the Biden campaign Osburn and Haeck for comment and did not immediately receive a response.  Fox News' Joseph Wulfsohn contributed to this report.  ", https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-town-hall-questioners-former-obama-speechwriter-wife-pennsylvania-democrat,0.8103329172013441

80,Lost San Francisco Zoo Lemur found 5 miles away in Daly City, Daryl Morey and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta reportedly failed to address any fallout over the Hong Kong tweet controversy that took the NBA by storm last year. According to The New York Times Morey and Fertitta were asked about the controversy Thursday over China but “abruptly ended the interview after receiving questions about it.” Morey told the newspaper he left the organization under his own volition and Fertitta said their relationship wasn’t affected by it. ROCKETS' DARYL MOREY STEPPING DOWN AS GENERAL MANAGER YEAR AFTER HONG KONG TWEET CONTROVERSY: REPORT “We’ve never had a cross word over it” Fertitta told The New York Times. Morey stepped down from his role as the Rockets’ general manager. The Rockets had gone 44-28 in the shortened 2019-20 season and lost in the Western Conference semifinals after Morey made the shrewd move of trading for Russell Westbrook to pair with James Harden in the previous offseason. ESPN reported Thursday that Morey had stepped down. “After returning from Orlando and reflecting on what has been an amazing 14 years with the Houston Rockets and after discussing my thoughts with family and close friends I've decided I’ll be stepping away from the Rockets organization effective November 1st. Tilman and I have had many conversations since I returned and his unwavering support and counsel during our time together has been critical to our success” Morey said in a statement. “It has been the most gratifying experience of my professional life to lead the Rockets basketball organization and I look forward to working with Tilman and the management team on the transition. I am very confident that the future – for the Rockets and for our incredible fans – is in great hands and that the Rockets will continue to perform at the highest level.” Fertitta added: “On behalf of the entire Rockets organization I would like to thank Daryl Morey for his hard work and dedication over the past 14 seasons. Daryl is a brilliant innovator who helped the Rockets become a perennial contender. I have truly enjoyed working with Daryl and couldn't have asked for a better general manager to have at the start of my ownership. I wish him and his family all the best.” TRUMP SAYS MEDIA NBA ARE ‘BOUGHT OUT’ BY CHINA: 'IT'S A BIG POT OF GOLD' Morey had come under fire more than a year ago for his support of the Hong Kong protesters. The tweet led to China pulling the NBA games off the airwaves and the Communist regime pulling down banners advertising preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets. Fertitta had publicly supported Morey despite the wave of backlash it brought the NBA including the increased scrutiny over the league’s ties with China and players failing to speak out against China despite dipping their toes into social justice waters. Morey took over as general manager of the team in 2007 and is one of the people credited with valuing the three-pointer over the two-pointer which led to a massive increase in long-range shots being taken. However the idea never translated into championships of any kind for the Rockets.

81,Daryl Morey Rockets owner avoid questions on Hong Kong China controversy after ex-GM's exit: report, MILAN (AP) — Doctors are warning that Europe is at a turning point as the coronavirus surges back across the continent including among vulnerable people and governments try to impose restrictions without locking whole economies down. HEALTHY YOUNG PEOPLE MAY WAIT UNTIL FOR CORONAVIRUS VACCINE UNTIL 2022 WHO OFFICIAL SAYS With newly confirmed cases reaching records the Czech Republic has shut schools and is building a field hospital Poland has limited restaurant hours and closed gyms and schools and France is planning a 9 p.m. curfew in Paris and other big cities. In Britain authorities are closing pubs and bars in areas in the country’s north while putting limits on socializing in London and other parts of the country. “This is a serious situation that should not be underestimated. It is serious on a European level” Italy’s health minister Roberto Speranza said Friday. Europe is not alone in seeing a resurgence. In the United States new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states and deaths per day are climbing in 30. “If we don’t get a handle on this we run the risk of getting into a situation that’s harder to control” Bertrand Levrat the head of Switzerland’s biggest hospital complex told The Associated Press. “We are really at a turning point — things can go both ways.” But while officials are sounding the alarm on the rising cases they are also wary of imposing the stricter nationwide lockdowns that devastated their economies this spring. Instead they are trying more targeted restrictions. France is deploying 12000 extra police to enforce its new curfew; Saturday night will be the first time establishments will be forced to close at 9 p.m. Restaurants cinemas and theaters are trying to figure out how can survive the forced early closures. CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot told Le Parisien newspaper she is negotiating for exceptions to a monthlong curfew across the Paris region and eight other metropolitan areas. One movie theater chain will start opening at 8 a.m. in hopes of making up evening losses. Since Paris restaurants generally open at 7 or 7:30 p.m. for dinner some might close altogether because it no longer makes financial sense to stay open for such a short shift. “The French culture world isn’t invincible it needs help” author and filmmaker Yoann Sfar who has a new movie coming out said Friday on RTL radio. Italy the first country outside of Asia to detect local transmission of the virus has banned pickup sports and public gatherings after health officials said the resurgence had reached ’’an acute phase” following a period of relative grace following its particularly strict lockdown. Speranza the health minister told reporters that any new measures in Italy including a curfew need to be “well-considered.” Massimo Galli the director of infectious diseases at Milan’s Luigi Sacco hospital said Italy’s surge — which hit pandemic highs of new daily infections this week — is not the result of record testing as policy makers have suggested but a sign of a real return among the population most at risk of developing serious illness if infected. That is a worrying trend since a tide of serious cases has the potential to swamp hospitals and it’s one that can be seen in other countries on the continent as many see even higher numbers than Italy. CORONAVIRUS RISK LOWERED FOR THIS BLOOD TYPE STUDIES SUGGEST France Spain and Britain recorded more than 300 infections per 100000 residents over the past two weeks compared to Italy’s quickening but relatively low 106. The Czech Republic reported over 700 people infected per 100000 and the country’s military will start to build a field hospital at Prague’s exhibition center this weekend — a reminder of the dark days of spring when many countries put up makeshift facilities to ease pressure on overwhelmed medical centers. The government is also negotiating with neighboring Germany and some other countries for Czechs to be treated there if the health system can’t handle them. In Italy Milan is the epicenter of the resurgence and it too is seeing its hospitals strained. Sacco’s COVID-19 ward was the first in the city to begin filling up. “We have a situation that reminds one quite distressingly of the one that we already have experienced” Galli told The Associated Press referring to the peak in March and April when Italy hit its record of 969 deaths in one day. The country recorded 83 deaths on Thursday — twice previous days but far off earlier levels. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Already in Milan Galli said that the number of elderly patients or those with other risk factors is growing indicating the virus has moved beyond its initial late September’s expansion when most of the cases were mild or asymptomatic caught by screening and contact tracing. Since then mixing among families within companies and among students outside of school has fueled the spread to more vulnerable people he said renewing pressure on Milan’s hospitals. “The trend is already there and it is frankly alarming” he said though he noted that not all of Italy was yet experiencing a surge. But that he said might only be a matter of time. Galli said Italy ”will follow in the footsteps″ of its European neighbors unless the transmission chain is blocked in the next two weeks. Galli fears that new nationwide restrictions adopted over the past two weeks — including mandatory masks outdoors a ban on pickup sports games among friends and restaurant closures at midnight — are not enough. He urged more restrictions be imposed on public transport and leisure activities if authorities want to avoid another lockdown — bad both for the economy and the social fabric. While Italy’s lockdown in the spring bought it more time Galli said the current resurgence shows “how quickly there is a risk of wasting the results of even a very decisive and very important intervention.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP , https://www.foxnews.com/health/virus-at-turning-point-in-europe-hitting-at-risk-groups,0.8102697582837981

87,Daniel Snyder's alleged lewd remark about Washington's cheerleaders revealed in new report, WINDHAM N.H. – South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem campaigning in the battleground state of New Hampshire on behalf of President Trump and fellow Republicans took aim at Joe Biden over a much-publicized story this week in the New York Post regarding the Democratic presidential nominee’s son Hunter Biden. The president his reelection campaign and surrogates have spotlighted the report to charge that Biden’s actions as vice president during President Obama’s administration were influenced by his son’s business dealings in Ukraine. The Biden campaign and allies have blasted the report and point to the recent GOP-led Senate investigation that found no evidence of wrongdoing on the then-vice president’s part with regard to Ukraine. WHICH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS THE CAMPAIGN CASH ADVANTAGE HEADING INTO THE FINAL STRETCH When asked by Fox News how the report could impact female voters -- who currently favor Biden over Trump according to public opinion polling -- Noem argued Thursday that “women overwhelmingly want somebody leading the country that they can trust and this really does grave damage to Joe Biden’s credibility. This is the kind of corruption in power that we don’t want in our leaders and I’m glad that it’s being talked about and we should continue to dig into it and get the full truth.” Noem -- speaking with Fox News after she headlined an event at the Trump campaign’s New Hampshire headquarters with staffers and volunteers and before she keynoted a major fundraiser for state’s Republican Party -- also praised federal appeals court judge Amy Coney Barrett whom the president nominated to the Supreme Court to succeed the late justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Speaking after Barrett finished up her appearance at her confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee Noem said: “I think she was fantastic and I think she made some of those senators look like clowns honestly. She’s highly intelligent very qualified for the position.” And taking aim at Democratic senators who oppose Barrett nomination Noem added: “I think the political attacks that they attempted during committee process just failed.” The president and Senate Republicans are moving quickly to confirm the conservative Barrett to succeed the liberal-leaning Ginsburg before Election Day when the White House and the current GOP control of the Senate are up for grabs. Democrats are virtually powerless to stop Trump and the Senate Republican majority from pushing through Barrett’s nomination ahead of the election -- which would tilt the court’s conservative majority to 6-3. Noem was interviewed by Fox News with a week to go until the second and final presidential debate between Biden and Trump. Noem a former state lawmaker who served eight years in Congress before winning election as governor in 2018 has spent plenty of time on the debate stage. When asked what advice she’d give the president – whose performance at the first debate was pilloried by critics – if she was advising Trump ahead of the final face-off Noem said: “I would just encourage him to let his love for the American people to shine through. This is a huge opportunity for him to really talk about what he’s delivered for the country these four years and why he gets up everyday and he fights for the everyday ordinary man.” If the president wins reelection Noem didn’t appear to be ready to sign up to serve in Trump’s second-term cabinet if asked.  “I always take phone calls from the president. That’s one thing that I learned. He’s a dear friend and has been wonderful to our state but I really enjoy being where I’m at today” she said. Noem – who isn’t up for reelection until 2022 --  has been crisscrossing the country in recent months campaigning on behalf of the president and fellow Republicans. But the rising star in the GOP – she had a featured speaking role at the Republican National Convention in August – is considered by many pundits to be a potential contender for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. And the trip to New Hampshire which holds the first primary in the race for the White House and a stop recently in Iowa which kicks off the nomination calendar with its caucuses is sparking more speculation about her possible national aspirations. During her trip to New Hampshire Noem made a quick visit for breakfast at the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester which has long been a must-stop for White House hopefuls. The governor spoke with customers and the kitchen staff. And when she arrived at the Trump headquarters a woman in the crowd yelled out “Kristi for 2024.” “People are sweet and they’ve been watching South Dakota” Noem told Fox News. But Noem said her trip to New Hampshire is to emphasize “how important it is that we have President Trump in the White House. If Joe Biden is in the White House our way of life will be devastated. I honestly believe the policies that he’s embraced will destroy America. So for me that’s important enough to come here and talk face to face with people who may have the chance to turn this state red and take it for President Trump.” That said Noem isn’t ruling anything out when it comes to her political future. “I haven’t even ruled out what I’m doing tomorrow” she said. , https://www.foxnews.com/politics/noem-hunter-biden-story-joe-biden-damage-credibility,0.8103168405183215

90,Jack in the Box introduces plant-based 'Unchicken' sandwich, With the coronavirus mounting a resurgence in areas across the U.S. schools not already using a hybrid schedule to teach students may look to begin virtual learning in their districts. But by moving lessons online teachers will lose the in-person connection they have with some students which could make it difficult to pick up on cues regarding mental health. “Teachers are translators of emotion” Dr. Isaiah Pickens a clinical psychologist who works with teachers and educators to identify and address racial inequality issues and mental health problems in students told Fox News. “They are able to see students as an individual and in the context of the classroom.” HEALTHY YOUNG PEOPLE MAY WAIT FOR CORONAVIRUS VACCINE UNTIL 2022 WHO OFFICIAL SAYS Losing the physical classroom however doesn’t mean teachers have to lose the connection with their students. Pickens said teachers will still have plenty of information coming their way from students that could signal a larger issue is going on. “If there’s a change in mood there’s less engagement hearing things as the student learns from home like arguments etc. these allow educators to perk their ears up” he said. And while the safety of the physical classroom may be gone there are many ways educators can provide support to their students virtually that might even be more helpful than before. CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC CAUSES RISE IN DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS PRELIMINARY CDC DATA SHOWS “The virtual world gives multiple modes for communicating so there are multiple ways you can communicate something that you are experiencing” Pickens said adding that a chatroom an email or a video chat might actually make it easier for a student to approach a teacher with an issue rather than doing so in-person. Others however may feel at a disadvantage to teaching their students remotely especially those who never had the chance to meet their students in person to establish a baseline for their mood demeanor or work habits. For those teachers Pickens recommends looking for the universal signs that could mean emotional distress such as feelings of hopeless incomplete assignments low levels of engagement or not participating in class activities online or being a disruption like arguing with students in online chats. “Teachers don’t need to be social workers but what [recognizing these emotions] does is it normalizes that one we’re all going through something right now and two it’s OK to share parts of ourselves in virtual space to use that foundation to continue to connect and open up in many ways” he said.   BYU-IDAHO STUDENTS CAUGHT CONTRACTING CORONAVIRUS TO DONATE PLASMA FOR CASH WILL 'BE SUSPENDED' SCHOOL SAYS Being direct when communicating with the student can help bolster their emotional being or let them know there is help available. Teachers should reach out directly to the student to let them know they notice a change in attitude Pickens said. “Being direct allows students to feel seen” Pickens said. “Communicating that they are not a burden whether virtual or in a private chat saying ‘I’m wondering what it is that has you feeling whatever feeling they are feeling’ it helps the kids have language to communicate. Think about who is the best ongoing support for the child it might be a parent or it might be a peer who can help make the kid feel less lonely – and sometimes it might be professional support.” On the flip side Pickens said virtual learning has helped teachers notice students who may have previously slipped through the cracks due to shyness or lack of confidence in the classroom and those students are starting to blossom through online platforms. It’s also helping to identify students who might need more academic support.

93,Clawing back votes: 7 states allow voters to resubmit ballots," EXCLUSIVE: The Republican National Committee (RNC) on Friday filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) alleging that the censorship of the New York Post article about Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings and former Vice President Joe Biden’s alleged knowledge of those dealings amounts to an “illegal corporate in-kind political contribution” to the Biden campaign Fox News has learned. The complaint filed by the RNC on Friday and obtained exclusively by Fox News states that the RNC “believes that Twitter has violated FECA and the Commission’s Regulations by making corporate in-kind contributions to Biden for President.” TWITTER LOCKS OFFICIAL TRUMP CAMPAIGN ACCOUNT AFTER SHARING HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO The RNC in its complaint said Twitter “is a partisan actor run by partisan Democrats” and is “using its corporate resources to provide active support for Joe Biden’s campaign in violation of federal law” and demanded the FEC “conduct an immediate investigation” into Twitter’s “illegal in-kind contributions to the Biden campaign” and “impose the maximum penalty allowed under the law.” The complaint comes after Twitter prevented users from sharing a link to a New York Post report about emails shedding light on Hunter Biden’s business dealings and contradicting the Democratic presidential nominee’s past comments claiming he had no knowledge of his son’s business activities. The RNC claimed that Twitter is “engaged in arguably the most brazen and unprecedented act of media suppression in this country’s history and it is doing so for the clear purpose of supporting the Biden campaign.” The RNC claimed that Twitter has “taken unprecedented actions to suppress the articles from being shared on its platform.” “Democrat media consultants can only dream of such abilities” the complaint read. “Through its ad hoc partisan oppression of media critical of Biden [Twitter] is making illegal corporate in-kind contributions as it provides unheard-of media services for Joe Biden’s campaign.” The complaint references federal campaign finance law which “strictly prohibits corporations from making contributions to federal candidates” and notes that “contribution” is defined to mean “anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing an election.” The RNC also noted that the “suppression” of The Post article “provides a thing of value to the Biden campaign.” “[Twitter] is acting as Biden’s media operative taking proactive steps to shield Biden from negative news coverage by blocking its distribution and muzzling those who try” the complaint read. “If [Twitter] charged for this service Biden no doubt would gladly pay a significant price.” The RNC went on to claim that Twitter’s actions “have not occurred in a vacuum” and instead are “keeping with the company’s open support for Joe Biden and hostility toward President Trump and other conservatives.” “[Twitter’s] feud with President Trump is well known as are its frequent efforts to censor the President’s tweets and the ‘shadow banning’ of prominent Republicans including RNC’s Chair Ronna McDaniel and several Republican members of Congress” the complaint states while adding that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and other executives “are prolific donors to the Democrat party and other left-wing causes with 98.7% of the company’s total political contributions going to Democrats.” The complaint also claims there is a “revolving door between the Biden campaign” and Twitter saying Twitter’s public policy director recently left the company to join the Biden transition team and Sen. Kamala Harris’ former press secretary is now serving as a senior communications manager at Twitter. FACEBOOK TWITTER LIMIT DISTRIBUTION OF NY POST HUNTER BIDEN STORY ""Twitter’s decision to censor news articles that harm Joe Biden’s candidacy is so transparently biased it would make even the governments of China or North Korea blush"" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News. ""Fortunately in this country we have tools at our disposal to fight back against this type of censorship. The RNC is calling on the Federal Elections Commission to investigate whether Twitter’s actions amount to an illegal corporate in-kind contribution to the Biden presidential campaign.""  She added: ""Twitter’s flagrant bias and direct support for one presidential candidacy over the other should result in the proper financial ramifications under our campaign finance laws.” Neither the spokesman for Twitter nor the the Biden campaign responded immediately to Fox News' request for comment.  The controversy came after the New York Post obtained emails that reveal that Hunter Biden purportedly introduced his father to a top executive at Burisma Holdings in 2015. The Post report revealed that Biden at Hunter’s request allegedly met with Burisma adviser Vadym Pozharskyi in April 2015 in Washington D.C. The meeting was mentioned in an email of appreciation according to the Post that Pozharskyi sent to Hunter Biden on April 17 2015 — a year after Hunter took on his position on the board of Burisma and a year prior to Biden helping to push Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin out of his job. Shokin was investigating Burisma. “Dear Hunter thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent some time together. It’s realty [sic] an honor and pleasure” the email read. Biden and Biden allies have maintained though that his intervention prompting the firing of Shokin had nothing to do with his son but rather was tied to corruption concerns. The emails turned up on the hard drive of a laptop dropped off at a repair shop in 2019 the Post reported adding that a copy of the hard drive ended up in the hands of Robert Costello a lawyer for Rudy Giuliani a personal attorney for President Trump. MCENANY CLAIMS TWITTER HOLDING HER 'AT GUNPOINT' UNTIL SHE DELETES NEW YORK POST'S HUNTER BIDEN REPORT The Biden campaign hit back on Wednesday: ""Investigations by the press during impeachment and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official U.S. policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing.” A Biden campaign spokesman said that Trump administration officials testified that the former vice president did not engage in wrongdoing. ""The New York Post never asked the Biden campaign about the critical elements of this story"" Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said. ""They certainly never raised that Rudy Giuliani -- whose discredited conspiracy theories and alliance with figures connected to Russian intelligence have been widely reported -- claimed to have such materials.” Bates said campaign officials also reviewed Biden's official schedules from the time and the meeting alleged by the New York Post did not take place. Meanwhile prominent Republicans including White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany as well as President Trump’s reelection campaign’s official Twitter account were suspended after attempting to share the link to the story. ""This is election interference plain and simple. For Twitter to lock the main account of the campaign of the president of the United States is a breathtaking level of political meddling and nothing short of an attempt to rig the election"" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News. ""Joe Biden’s Silicon Valley pals are aggressively blocking negative news stories about their guy and preventing voters from accessing important information. This is like something from communist China or Cuba not the United States of America.” Twitter said Wednesday the New York Post article was in violation of its ""hacked materials policy.” The company's 2018 policy prohibits the distribution of content ""obtained without authorization."" Twitter doesn't want to incentivize hacking or circulating ""possibly illegally obtained materials.” ""Commentary on or discussion about hacked materials such as articles that cover them but do not include or link to the materials themselves aren’t a violation of this policy"" Twitter said. ""Our policy only covers links to or images of hacked material themselves.” Twitter noted that once users remove the tweet in violation their account will be unlocked and they can continue tweeting.  ""Accounts that Tweet the materials or links to the materials referenced here may be required to delete those Tweets based on our policies on hacked materials and private and personal information"" a Twitter spokesperson said Thursday.

94,RNC files FEC complaint against Twitter claims company made 'illegal in-kind contribution' to Biden campaign, Catherine Oxenberg’s daughter India Oxenberg can vividly remember how she was groomed by “Smallville” actress Allison Mack to have sex with NXIVM leader Keith Raniere. The 29-year-old is coming forward with her story in the upcoming STARZ four-part docuseries “Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult.” In 2015 India was recruited by Mack 38 to join NXIVM’s master-slave sorority also known as DOS. It was there where Mack became India’s “master.” “One of my first commands from Allison was to seduce Keith” India told People magazine on Friday. “At the time I believed it was a place I could push against fear and vulnerability. That’s what I was told the assignment was. I wanted to believe Allison.” CATHERINE OXENBERG’S DAUGHTER INDIA DESCRIBES BEING BRANDED BY NXIVM SEX CULT: ‘THERE WAS NO CHOICE TO SAY NO’ According to the outlet once India joined DOS Mack demanded what she described as “collateral” including nude photos and other personal mementos. It was part of a blackmail scheme that was also used on other female members.  India said if she didn’t complete Mack’s demands she didn’t question the punishments which included cold showers and extreme calorie restriction among others. The outlet previously reported India was branded with Raniere’s initials as part of an initiation ceremony. At that time India and the other women present were told the branding was a “symbol of the elements.”  “I had two women holding my hands and my feet so I wouldn’t convulse” India told the outlet. “I remember the smell - of flesh. I remember crying but not with pain. There was no choice to say no.” SEX CULT CONVICT KEITH RANIERE'S FORMER NEIGHBORS 'TERRIFIED' AFTER DOCUMENTARY CLAIMS HE POISONED WOMEN IN NY HOME The outlet noted that by that point after five years of indoctrination into NXIVM India had lost her ability to think independently. “I was coerced and manipulated and believed what I was doing was helping me when I was really just serving Keith” India admitted. However India claimed there was a brief moment in 2018 when Mack may have had doubts. “She grabbed my hand” claimed India. “She said ‘I don’t know if I’m making the right decision. What if I wanted to have children or a husband?’ She started to question her choices. I had never seen her so vulnerable.” CATHERINE OXENBERG’S DAUGHTER INDIA SAYS SHE WAS 'NOT THAT IMPRESSED' WHEN SHE MET NXIVM LEADER KEITH RANIERE Raniere the disgraced guru of the self-improvement organization in upstate New York was convicted last year on charges that he turned some of his followers into sex slaves.  Prosecutors told jurors that the 60-year-old’s organization operated like a cult that won him the devotion of many women including Mack as well as Clare Bronfman heiress to the Seagram’s liquor fortune. Prosecutors said Raniere formed a secret subgroup made up of brainwashed female “slaves” who were branded with his initials and forced to have sex with him. It was India’s mother who went public with her fight to save her daughter from NXIVM in 2017. In numerous interviews she pleaded with the press about Raniere and his cult. FORMER NXIVM FOLLOWER CLAIMS CONVICTED SEX CULT LEADER KEITH RANIERE IS LINKED TO PAL’S DISAPPEARANCE IN DOC Once India broke free from NXIVM she moved back home to Los Angeles where she was welcomed back by Oxenberg 59 with open arms. India said she has since embarked on two years of intensive therapy and deprogramming. “There were so many emotions” Oxenberg told People magazine. “I had a whole recovery team ready for her as soon as she took the first steps forward.” Raniere and Mack were arrested in 2018. The fallen leader was found guilty of seven counts including sex trafficking racketeering and possession of child pornography. He awaits sentencing now scheduled for Oct. 27 and could face life in prison. ALLISON MACK’S 'SMALLVILLE' CO-STAR SAYS HER ARREST IN NXIVM CASE WAS A ‘COMPLETE SHOCK’ Mack who once shared an apartment with India pleaded guilty to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges. In 2019 she tearfully told the judge “I was lost.” She also admitted to helping Raniere assemble his harem of brainwashed female “slaves.” Mack still awaits sentencing and remains under house arrest. India said she now hopes her story can help others.  “I was so ashamed I couldn’t seem to talk or get the words out” said India. “I’m so for my mom and all that she did.” ALLISON MACK'S WIFE NICKI CLYNE DEFENDS NXIVM SEX CULT LEADER KEITH RANIERE “Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult” airs Oct. 18 at 9 p.m. on STARZ.

She then attempted to answer but her response was inaudible. A moderator then moved onto the next question for Ernst whose answer was also disrupted by a technical error before CBS affiliate KCCI 8 cut to a break. The audio faded in and out during Greenfield’s next answer on the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett and she experienced another technical glitch when pressed on her stance about packing the Supreme Court.   “Theresa Greenfield pretended she couldn’t hear the question about confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett because she doesn’t want Iowans to know that she opposes religious liberties wants to restrict the Second Amendment and even supports extreme environmental rules that would hurt farmers” said Ernst spokesperson Melissa Deatsch.   Greenfield was able to answer her next question before there were further audio difficulties and the network immediately faded to black. The technical difficulties occurred in the first 15 minutes of the debate before KCCI 8 was able to remedy the problem. Greefield was later given an additonal question to make up for the early difficulties.  ""The Senate Judiciary Hearings prevented Senator Ernst from making it back to Des Moines"" Sather said.  ""We still wanted to provide this critical debate to the voters of Iowa"" he added. ""The unique challenges of this production led to some unexpected issues.” IOWA REPUBLICAN FILES FEC COMPLAINT OVER 'DARK MONEY' GOING TO SEN.

Rep. Raul Grijalva D-Ariz. led a group of 13 Democratic lawmakers in penning a letter to demand that no corporate lobbyists or executives be confirmed to the cabinet.  “One of the most important lessons of the Trump administration is the need to stop putting corporate officers and lobbyists in charge of our government” the lawmakers wrote.  Grijalva was joined by freshman powerhouses Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York Rashida Tlaib of Michigan Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Katie Porter of California. DEM 'SQUAD' ACCUSES TWITTER OF SHIELDING TRUMP FROM HATE-TWEETS AFTER DISMISSING ATTACKS ON THEM They addressed the letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. since the Senate has the power to confirm a president's nominees. The lawmakers didn't single out former Vice President Joe Biden directly but called for the Senate to deny corporate interests from holding government power ""in this or any future administration."" Politico was the first to report on the letter which was also endorsed by a bevy of progressive and environmental groups including Indivisible Justice Democrats Our Revolution Greenpeace USA Sunrise Movement and Progressive Change Campaign Committee. The lawmakers called out President Trump's cabinet choices as examples of how corporate interests have improperly invaded the government's work including Rex Tillerson the former CEO and chairman of Exxon Mobil Corporation who became Secretary of State; Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross ""who spent decades in investment banking and private equity"" and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler ""who represented Murray Energy and other fossil fuel producers as a lobbyist before coming to the administration"" the letter states. ""Ending the practice of filling cabinet and sub-cabinet posts with current or former corporate officers and lobbyists is not to offer a commentary on each individual person’s character"" the lawmakers wrote. ""It is to make a statement of principle."" Spokespersons for Biden McConnell and Schumer did not immediately offer comment to Fox News. PROGRESSIVES INCLUDING 'SQUAD' RELEASE AGENDA TO PUSH BIDEN TO THE LEFT Some progressives have already laid out an agenda they would like to see Biden enact if he's elected in an effort to pressure the Democrat leftward.

98,AOC House progressives call for ban on corporate executives in a Biden cabinet," Illinois prosecutors pushed back against arguments made by Kyle Rittenhouse’s criminal attorneys in their efforts to stop his extradition to Kenosha Wis. where the 17-year-old is accused of fatally shooting two people and wounding a third during a night of unrest. Prosecutors in Lake County argued in court papers submitted late Thursday that Rittenhouse’s lawyers’ petition for a writ of habeas corpus was used “improperly.” The petition – filed by the teenager’s attorney John Pierce on Oct. 8 – argues that Rittenhouse’s safety is in jeopardy and the case does not meet the legal requirements necessary to move someone from a juvenile center to an adult facility. They also said to extradite him “would be to turn him over to the mob.” But prosecutors said Rittenhouse’s attorneys used the habeas corpus argument “as a guise to argue the underlying facts of the Wisconsin charges inject inadmissible evidence surrounding the circumstances of events in Kenosha Wisconsin and color the record with purported defenses to those charges” court papers show. MAN WHO FIRED SHOTS BEFORE KYLE RITTENHOUSE IN KENOSHA CHARGED In a statement provided to Fox News on Friday Pierce said he and his team “will never stop” fighting for Rittenhouse. “Lake County’s filing speaks for itself. We look forward to the hearing on our Habeas Corpus petition on October 30th” he said. “We are confident Judge Novak will give Kyle a fair hearing. We will not relent in fighting to free Kyle whether it takes weeks or years.” Rittenhouse who lived in an Antioch Ill. apartment with his mother Wendy and sisters faces charges of first-degree intentional homicide; first-degree reckless homicide; attempted first-degree intentional homicide; possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18; and two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment all of which are felonies. He remains in an Illinois jail cell.  The charges against Rittenhouse stem from a series of alleged shootings on the night of Aug. 25 during unrest over the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse later surrendered to police in his hometown. Before the shootings Rittenhouse told the Daily Caller’s Richie McGinniss he was there that night to protect a business that he was seen standing near and also “to help people.” “If there’s somebody hurt I’m running into harm’s way"" he told McGinniss. ""That’s why I have my rifle because I need to protect obviously but I also have my med kit.” KYLE RITTENHOUSE WON'T FACE CHARGES FOR GUN OFFENSE IN ILLINOIS Shortly after 11:30 p.m. Joseph Rosenbaum 36 and 26-year-old Anthony Huber died as a result of the shooting. Gaige Grosskreutz who was allegedly holding a handgun at the time was wounded but survived. Rittenhouse’s attorneys said the teen did try to surrender to Kenosha authorities before returning home. He was charged on Aug. 27. Mike Nerheim the Lake County state’s attorney previously said that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker later signed a warrant to return Rittenhouse to Wisconsin after a request from Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers a fellow Democrat. In Thursday’s petition response prosecutors were also critical of defense attorneys’ arguments that Wisconsin and Illinois authorities didn’t follow legal technicalities required for extradition calling them ""a last ditch effort to attack the Governor’s Warrant.” “[T]he defendant argued that extradition is somehow improper because of an alleged typographical mistake and missing signature on an Illinois (italicized) arrest citation” the court records state. “These arguments are improper and a red herring. The Illinois arrest citation had nothing to do with the Governor’s grant of extradition nor is it relevant to this limited hearing on this matter.” Nonetheless prosecutors said the circumstances of the shootings have no role in whether to transfer Rittenhouse across the state border. “This is an extradition hearing. It bears repeating: an extradition hearing"" the court filing said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rittenhouse meanwhile will not face gun charges in Illinois after an investigation revealed the gun used in the Kenosha shooting was purchased stored and used in Wisconsin the Lake County State’s Attorney’s Office announced earlier this week. There is no evidence the gun was ever physically possessed by Rittenhouse in Illinois it said. He is due back in Lake County court on Oct. 30 for an extradition hearing.

99,Kyle Rittenhouse: Illinois prosecutors defend efforts to extradite accused Kenosha shooter," Four coronavirus drugs were found to have ""little or no effect"" on hospitalized patients according to preliminary results from a World Health Organization study. Anticipated findings from the WHO’s multi-country Solidarity trial were posted ahead of peer review in medRxiv on Thursday which assessed remdesivir hydroxychloroquine interferon and an HIV-drug combo lopinavir-ritonavir. “The main outcomes of mortality initiation of ventilation and hospitalization duration were not clearly reduced by any study drug” according to the study. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE While hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir were dropped from the WHO trial over the summer over futility the remdesivir findings directly contrast with results from a U.S. NIH-led study which showed to shorten patients' path to recovery by about four to five days. Those results were recently upheld by a final report of which John Beigel associate director of clinical research in the division of microbiology and infectious disease at NIAID told TIME that “these data reinforce the value of Remdesivir in hospitalized patients.” The drug manufacturer of remdesivir Gilead Sciences released a statement voicing concerns over the WHO trial.  ""The emerging data appear inconsistent with more robust evidence from multiple randomized controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals validating the clinical benefit of Veklury® (remdesivir)"" company officials wrote. ""We are concerned that the data from this openlabel global trial have not undergone the rigorous review required to allow for constructive scientific discussion particularly given the limitations of the trial design."" Gilead previously ran its own clinical trials on the drug and found that 65% of moderately ill patients had improvement after 11 days. The WHO study involved over 11000 adults across 405 hospitals in 30 countries on multiple treatments tested against a control arm; 2750 patients were allocated remdesivir. (The NIH study involved 1062 patients who were randomly assigned remdesivir or a placebo for 10 days.) In the company statement sent to Fox News Gilead pointed to the WHO trial's ""significant heterogeneity in trial adoption implementation controls and patient populations"" because the trial design prioritized broad access. Dr. Soumya Swaminathan WHO chief scientist touted the Solidarity trial on Wednesday calling it a ""wonderful global collaboration"" that benefited from preparations and investments made over the last few years having learned from Ebola and other outbreaks. She said in approaching the trials for COVID-19 investigators knew how to write protocols quickly ideas were shared around the clock and drug manufacturers came forward to donate drugs. She called it a ""good experience"" all-in-all and on Wednesday before the data was released she said next plans will involve monoclonal antibodies immunomodulators and new antiviral drugs developed within the last few months.

100,4 coronavirus treatments including remdesivir hydroxychloroquine flop in large WHO study, A Chinese state broadcaster alluded to consequences over those who criticize China in a message after Daryl Morey stepped down as Houston Rockets' general manager on Thursday. CCTV warned “hurt the feelings of the Chinese people will have to pay a price” signaling that Morey was forced out over his tweet in support of Hong Kong protesters last year. However The New York Times reported that Morey’s departure was under his own volition.

The media outlet noted that the broadcaster wished the general manager well in his future endeavors but used a phrase meant for those who had died. Morey stepped down from his role as the Rockets’ general manager. The Rockets had gone 44-28 in the shortened 2019-20 season and lost in the Western Conference semifinals after Morey made the shrewd move of trading for Russell Westbrook to pair with James Harden in the previous offseason. ESPN reported Thursday that Morey had stepped down. ROCKETS' DARYL MOREY STEPPING DOWN AS GENERAL MANAGER YEAR AFTER HONG KONG TWEET CONTROVERSY: REPORT Morey had come under fire more than a year ago for his support of the Hong Kong protesters. The tweet led to China pulling the NBA games off the airwaves and the Communist regime pulling down banners advertising preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta had publicly supported Morey despite the wave of backlash it brought the NBA including the increased scrutiny over the league’s ties with China and players failing to speak out against China despite dipping their toes into social justice waters. Morey took over as general manager of the team in 2007 and is one of the people credited with valuing the three-pointer over the two-pointer which led to a massive increase in long-range shots being taken. However the idea never translated into championships of any kind for the Rockets. Despite having teams with Harden Westbrook Chris Paul Yao Ming and Dwight Howard the Rockets never made it to the NBA Finals and haven’t been to one since 1995. The team has the longest active streak of playoff appearances at eight consecutive years.

105,Astros' Carlos Correa predicted walk-off home run against Rays in Game 5 manager says, Local television markets in the battleground states of Florida Arizona and Pennsylvania have become ground zero in the ferocious ad war between President Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden. According to a Friday report in USA Today since the end of September the top six markets were Tampa Orlando Miami Philadelphia Phoenix and Harrisburg.  TRUMP CAMPAIGN CANCELS OHIO IOWA TV ADS AMID OPTIMISM OVER SWING STATE ELECTION CHANCES Florida -- a perennial swing state enmeshed in a tight contest -- is crucial with the belt from Tampa to Orlando holding voters from key demographics: the elderly suburban women Latinos and military service members. Early voting begins in Florida on Oct. 19 as other states across the country see impressive early turnout. This year is expected to be a record-setting one for campaign spending and residents of the Sunshine State are seeing the fruits of that in a bumper crop of political spots.  In targeted ads the former vice president has focused on health care and the administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Alternatively the president warns voters about a radical left agenda under Biden and compared economic recovery amid the pandemic to his own recovery from the virus. The non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics says the 2020 campaign is projected to spend a record-setting $11 billion -- about 50% more than in 2016 when accounting for inflation.  In addition Biden has outpaced President Trump down the final stretch of the race with record-setting fundraising. The Federal Election Commission said that through the end of August Biden's campaign had raised $540 million while Trump’s raised $476 million. Working in tandem with their national party committees Biden raised $365 million and Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $210 million. All of that money came in before the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and a chaotic first presidential debate in Ohio. The advantage allowed the Biden campaign to purchase twice as many television ads in key battlegrounds. Biden has dominated television ads spending $223 million since April 9 according to the Wesleyan Media Project. He's also not slowing down.  While the president has outpaced Biden in online ads throughout the election the Biden campaign has committed to playing catch-up.  To both campaigns' benefit online ads can be tailored to specific regions of a state or to a specific audience. That said local television ads are much more affordable.  Still presidential ads alone won't determine the victor. Trump was greatly outspent by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016: $768 million to $398 million. He captured an unprecedented amount of free news coverage however and can generate even more as president.

109,Rudy Giuliani: Purported Hunter Biden emails will 'shock the hell out of you'," The embattled New York Times editorial board has declared President Trump’s re-election “the greatest threat to American democracy since World War II.”  The newspaper’s editorial page has come under fire in recent months for a series of events that ultimately led to now-former editorial page editor James Bennet stepping down amid internal chaos when the paper’s liberal staffers objected to a an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton R-Ark. earlier this year.   NY TIMES WRITERS IN 'OPEN REVOLT' AFTER PUBLICATION OF COTTON OP-ED CLAIM BLACK STAFF 'IN DANGER' The internal unrest caused now-former Times opinion columnist and editor Bari Weiss to step down saying she was bullied by colleagues in an ""illiberal environment"" weeks after she declared there was a “civil war” inside the paper.  The editorial board’s latest piece urges Americans to “end our national crisis” and vote Trump out of the White House.   “Trump’s ruinous tenure already has gravely damaged the United States at home and around the world. He has abused the power of his office and denied the legitimacy of his political opponents shattering the norms that have bound the nation together for generations. He has subsumed the public interest to the profitability of his business and political interests. He has shown a breathtaking disregard for the lives and liberties of Americans. He is a man unworthy of the office he holds” the editorial board wrote.   NY TIMES EDITOR BARI WEISS SAYS THERE'S A 'CIVIL WAR' WITHIN PAPER AMID TOM COTTON UPROAR  “The editorial board does not lightly indict a duly elected president. During Mr. Trump’s term we have called out his racism and his xenophobia. We have critiqued his vandalism of the postwar consensus a system of alliances and relationships around the globe that cost a great many lives to establish and maintain” the editorial board continued. “We have again and again deplored his divisive rhetoric and his malicious attacks on fellow Americans.”  The Gray Lady’s editorial board then declared that Election Day could be a “turning point” about the future of America.   “The resilience of American democracy has been sorely tested by Mr. Trump’s first term. Four more years would be worse” the board wrote. “Trump is engaged in a full-throated assault on the integrity of that essential democratic process.”  The Times editorial board  floated the idea that Trump would contest a loss “in the courts or even on the streets” and called the “enormity and variety” of his wrongdoings “overwhelming.”   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The editorial board reminded readers of every issue it has disagreed with the president on over the last four years ranging from “embracing dictators like North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and Russia’s Vladimir Putin” to various issues related to his tax returns and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic to determine that he is the paper’s least favorite president in recent memory.   “Other modern presidents have behaved illegally or made catastrophic decisions. Richard Nixon used the power of the state against his political opponents. Ronald Reagan ignored the spread of AIDS. Bill Clinton was impeached for lying and obstruction of justice. George W. Bush took the nation to war under false pretenses” the board wrote. “Trump has outstripped decades of presidential wrongdoing in a single term.”  ", https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-york-times-trump-re-election-threat-democracy-wwii,0.8103881801385352
110,New York Times: Trump re-election 'greatest threat to American democracy since WWII', A federal judge Wednesday blocked efforts by a conservative group to stop more than $6 million in election grant money from tech industry groups to five cities in Wisconsin.  The lawsuit filed against the nonprofit Center for Tech and Civic Life claims that the influx in cash favors predominantly blue regions in nine battleground states including Iowa and Pennsylvania. WISCONSIN GOVERNOR MAY ACTIVATE NATIONAL GUARD TO FILL POLL WORKER SHORTAGES U.S. District Judge William Griesbach denied a request from the Wisconsin Voters Alliance and seven of its members saying he found nothing in the law to prohibit the cities from being awarded the money. The lawsuit argued that the grants create unconstitutional public-private partnerships that give an appearance of undue influence on a federal election. The $6.3 million in funding was awarded to Green Bay Kenosha Madison Milwaukee and Racine in Wisconsin a battleground state that President Trump clinched by a margin of less than 1% in 2016.  FACEBOOK TWITTER EMPLOYEES SEND OVER 90% OF POLITICAL DONATIONS TO DEMOCRATS: REPORT Among the top donors are Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan who have donated $300 million to the Center for Tech and Civic Life and Center for Election Innovation and Research to benefit local election officials.

111,$6.3M for elections from Zuckerberg Big Tech pour into Wisconsin despite conservative pushback, Few stories have captivated my attention quite like the controversy over Ice Cube deciding to help President Trump craft a plan that would aim to create jobs for millions of Black Americans. Part of the reason I’m sure is that I happen to be a lifelong Ice Cube fan. “Once Upon a Time In the Projects” has been one of my favorite songs since childhood -- wow I’ve really never been anything BUT a libertarian have I? -- but the bigger one is that this seems to be one of those news stories where pretty much everyone is missing the point. The people on the left who are furious that Ice Cube is “working with Trump” are getting it wrong the people on the right who are elated that Ice Cube is “working with Trump” are getting it wrong and the people who say that the controversy proves that people get far too angry at others for refusing to color inside partisan lines are also getting it wrong. The last group is close but not quite right -- because what this whole debacle actually proves is much worse than that: As a culture we are now largely so hyper-partisan that far too many of us cannot even understand the concept of someone wanting to focus on policy and solutions over partisanship. ICE CUBE DEFENDS WORKING WITH TRUMP CAMPAIGN ON 'PLATINUM PLAN' FOR BLACK AMERICANS Now I’m not going to weigh in on his policy proposal itself. What’s more seeing as I’m a White person I obviously don’t have any barometer for how this sort of thing could uniquely impact someone who is Black. I can’t relate to any of that but one thing that I can relate to as someone who has never aligned herself with either major political party is this increasingly weird phenomenon that it’s not just unacceptable but actually impossible to exist anywhere but firmly inside of one camp or the other -- that you’re either with us or you’re with them; that any and all discussions must be viewed through this prism. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER See what Ice Cube is doing here is in fact so clear that I don’t even have to have achieved my lifelong dream of actually knowing him to be able to see it: He is choosing policy over partisan politics. This is blatantly obvious not only because of the fact that he’s recently said he’s offered his advice on this to both campaigns but also because it’s what he’s been saying. At the beginning of last month he tweeted that he was talking to “both sides” about his Contract With Black America initiative calling it “a totally bipartisan issue that the country wants to solve.” Ice Cube cares about this issue and he’s simply pursuing all avenues in order to make his vision a reality. People can’t comprehend this. It has been so strange (yet familiar) to see how people have been accusing Ice Cube of being a “hypocrite” and using past statements that he’s made (such as that him tweeting in 2016 that he would “never endorse a m*********** like Trump”) as evidence of their position. In fact I keep seeing screenshots of that very tweet being shared as if that’s some kind of checkmate proving his hypocrisy and my only reaction is: What?! It is honestly crazy to me that people would see him not being a fan of President Trump and him being willing to try and do whatever it takes -- regardless of those personal feelings -- to make the country a better place as being mutually exclusive. They are not mutually exclusive to say that they are is indisputably wrong and I have zero idea why that seems to be so difficult to understand. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I have long said that we need to get a place where we can focus on finding solutions to problems over finding ways that “the other side” is worse. At this point I guess I may have to put that kind of talk on the backburner. Not because I don’t want to see that become reality because it’s still my ultimate goal but because apparently we have to work on even being able to recognize that such a thing is possible -- even when we see it happen right in front of our faces.

French newspaper Le Parisien identified the victim as ""Samuel P."" and reported the teacher opened up a discussion with his students on caricatures of the prophet Mohammed. He had received threats up to 10 days before the attack and a parent filed a complaint.  Police responded to reports of a ""suspicious man"" loitering near the school. Officers saw a man with a knife in the area shortly after the attack.  TERROR PROBE OPENED INTO PARIS KNIFE ATTACK THAT LEFT AT LEAST 2 INJURED Initial reports stated that the teacher had been beheaded but subsequent reports said the attacker instead slit the teacher's throat. Police have yet to verify the state of the victim. A police source said that witnesses heard the attacker shout “Allah Akbar"" or “God is Great"" but police have not verified this account according to reports. Prosecutors said they were treating the attack as ""a murder linked to a terrorist organization."" Police shot and killed the suspect after he did not respond to requests to drop his weapon Reuters reported. French broadcaster BFMTV reported that the suspected attacker was 18 and born in Moscow. The attack came as French President Emmanuel Macron is pushing for a new law against what he calls domestic “separatism” notably by Islamic radicals accused of indoctrinating vulnerable people through home schools extremist preaching and other activities.

114,Fort Lauderdale boat seen on video exploding 13 people injured," Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said he wrote in former President Ronald Reagan in this year’s presidential election turned off by his party’s ringleader and Democratic nominee Joe Biden.  “People really want someone who’s pragmatic who’s not afraid to compromise” Hogan told The Washington Post decrying the “extremes” of Democrats and Republicans in Washington.  From the coronavirus pandemic to the Supreme Court Hogan has frequently sparred with President Trump and as he continues to expand his political network nationwide some say the Maryland Republican could be mounting a possible 2024 presidential bid.  He is hosting fundraisers for candidates in states across the nation who cast themselves as sensible Republicans. Last month he filmed ads for Sen. Susan Collins a centrist Republican from Maine who faces a tough reelection race.  Collins is the only Republican in the Senate to assure she will not vote for Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court confirmation. Hogan is one of four sitting Republican governors not to voice support for Barrett’s confirmation before the election.  On Thursday he held a virtual fundraiser for Rep. John Katko R-N.Y. a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. Next week Hogan and Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker -- who hasn’t said who he’ll vote for but confirmed it won’t be Trump -- will hold a virtual town hall for Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott who voiced support of the Trump impeachment probe and has said Trump has “abused his powers” and should not be in office.  LARRY HOGAN'S BOOK CLAIMS MEMBERS OF TRUMP'S CABINET ASKED HIM TO PRIMARY PRESIDENT  Many of the candidates are from centrist suburban enclaves where Hogan thinks he “could help a little bit and show Democrats the kind of Republican they can feel comfortable voting for.” Hogan reportedly mulled a primary run for president and wrote in his recent memoir that he’d faced pressure to primary the president in 2019.  ""On cable news. In private phone calls. In conversations with fellow Republicans donors and members of the media. Even with a couple of Trump administration cabinet secretaries"" Hogan said. ""The media I understood. They were itching for a tussle in 2020"" Hogan said later. ""They were also enamored by the idea of a popular Republican governor a real Republican with a proven record of electoral success going toe to toe with Donald Trump inside the GOP."" CHARLIE BAKER JOINS SMALL LIST OF REPUBLICAN GOVS NOT VOTING FOR TRUMP  He added: ""But cabinet secretaries? Encouraging me to consider running against their boss the president? That one surprised me."" Until this week Hogan had refused to say who he’d support in the presidential race. But Hogan told the Post he’d voted by mail last week.  HOGAN KNOCKS TRUMP SAYS PRESIDENT NOT REACHING VOTERS GOP NEEDS 'TO WIN ELECTIONS IN THE FUTURE' Hogan called Reagan “my hero in politics” alongside his late father Rep. Larry Hogan Sr. whom he wrote in on his ballot in 2016. His father who died in 2017 was known for being the first Republican in Congress to support President Richard Nixon’s impeachment in 1974.  “I know it’s simply symbolic. It’s not going to change the outcome in my state. But I thought it was important to just cast a vote that showed the kind of person I’d like to see in office” Hogan said of this year’s ballot.  Hogan believes his record will help him become a key player in reshaping the GOP’s future post-Trump. He wants to veer the party back to focusing on fiscal conservatism-- and has spent his days as governor trimming regulation and fighting off tax increases.  “I’m a lifelong conservative Republican” Hogan 64 said recalling his campaign efforts for Reagan in his younger years. “Reagan was the guy. I marched around as a college kid on the floor of the convention with a Reagan hat and a Reagan sign.” In July the Maryland governor told “Your World” he thinks Trump might be sabotaging the party’s chances with moderate voters they might need in the future.  When host Neil Cavuto turned to Hogan's critique of the GOP's direction under Trump the governor said he wanted to emphasize a ""bigger-tent party of communicating and having a more positive vision for the future reaching out and broadening that tent.""

A new study suggests that a many Americans will soon be traveling out of town for the first time months and apparently will opt to fly instead of drive.  More than 55% of Americans surveyed in a new report from travel-booking app Hopper said they would be traveling during the November and December holiday months for the first time since the coronavirus became widespread in the U.S. this year.  Hopper surveyed 892 people in September and found that 52% of Americans also said they planned to fly instead of drive for Thanksgiving with 74% saying they planned to fly during the December holidays.  CATCHING CORONAVIRUS ON A PLANE 'EXTREMELY UNLIKELY' WHILE WEARING MASK DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE STUDY FINDS  If accurate the survey is good news for the struggling airline industry which was hit with a turbulent 2020 as nationwide shutdowns affected both international and domestic travel and fewer customers were willing to take flight during the COVID-19 pandemic.

116,Most Americans who are traveling for the holidays haven't been out of town since pandemic hit survey suggests, Men and women are approaching coronavirus precautions differently and men may be worse off for it. Women are less likely than men to put themselves at risk of catching COVID-19 because they’re more inclined to see the virus as a very serious health problem and therefore more inclined to follow rules set as a result of the pandemic according to a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS). The different attitudes may explain why women have shown less vulnerability to the virus and experienced less mortality compared to men according to the international researchers from Bocconi University in Italy Harvard Business School and other universities. HEALTHY YOUNG PEOPLE MAY WAIT FOR CORONAVIRUS VACCINE UNTIL 2022 WHO OFFICIAL SAYS People setting COVID-related health protocols may also need to create separate campaigns specifically aimed at men if they want men to catch on according to the researchers. “Policy makers who promote a new normality made of reduced mobility face masks and other changes should therefore design a gender-differentiated communication if they want to increase the compliance of men” Vincenzo Galasso one of the study’s authors said in a written statement. The researchers surveyed more than 21000 respondents in the U.S. Australia Austria France Germany Italy New Zealand and the U.K. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The gender differences were persistent across different sociodemographic characteristics and psychological factors according to Paola Profeta another of the study’s authors. “The biggest differences between men and women relate to behaviors that serve to protect others above all such as coughing in the elbow unlike those that can protect both themselves and others” Profeta said. The differences in COVID-19 diligence were smaller among married couples who live together and likely share the same views and among people most directly exposed to the pandemic according to the study. The differences also decreased over time in cases where men and women were exposed to the same flow of information. However while women were more onboard with coronavirus protections than men the study found that compliance with health protocols dropped with both men and women over time. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER This isn’t the only study to find a difference between men’s and women’s responses to the pandemic.

118,Jennifer Lopez Alex Rodriguez endorse Joe Biden ahead of 2020 presidential election," A new TV commercial by President Trump’s reelection campaign touts that the president is “the clear choice” for seniors who are a key voting bloc in many of the battleground states that will decide the winner of the presidential election. The ads running on the airwaves in Florida and other crucial swing states as the president courted voters 65 and older on Friday during a stop in Fort Myers in southwest Florida. ""I am honored to be here in Fort Myers to reaffirm my solemn pledge to America’s Seniors: I will protect you I will defend you and I will fight for you with every ounce of energy and conviction that I have"" the president told the crowd. And he vowed to keep seniors safe from the coronavirus pandemic promising that he was ""working as hard as I can"" so that they ""can kiss and hug your children and grandchildren very soon."" Senoirs make up roughtly 20% of the population in Florida which with 29 electoral votes up for grabs is the largest of the traditional battlegrounds. BIDEN CHARGES THAT TRUMP SEES SENIORS AS 'EXPENDABLE' The president’s stop came three days after Democratic nominee Joe Biden visited Florida and told a crowd of seniors that Trump views them as “expendable forgettable.” And the president’s trip comes as Trump is trying to avoid becoming the first Republican presidential nominee in two decades to lose the 65 and older vote. Former Vice President Al Gore – who in the 2000 election repeatedly emphasized that he would keep Social Security “in a lockbox” – was the last Democratic presidential nominee to win the senior vote. Four years ago Trump captured the national vote of those 65 and older by a 52%-45% margin over Clinton according to exit polls. But fast forward four years and the latest Fox News national poll indicates Biden with a slight 49%-47% edge over the president among seniors. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News national poll released this week showed a larger 54%-44% margin for Biden among voters 65 and older. WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS NATIONAL POLL SHOWS IN THE BIDEN-TRUMP SHOWDOWN One key reason may be the coronavirus pandemic which is tied to the deaths of nearly 220000 Americans and has hit seniors particularly hard. “Seniors are much more impacted by the coronavirus by their concern about getting it their concern about what happens if they do get. They’re much more sensitive to it because they’re in the population is most at risk” noted longtime Republican pollster Neil Newhouse. “They’re focused on coronavirus and the president’s numbers on coronavirus are not strong. Voters generally disapprove of the job he’s doing handling the issue.” Biden during a stop Tuesday in heavily populated Broward County in southeast Florida pointed to comments Trump made last month in Swanton Ohio when he argued that the coronavirus ""affects virtually nobody"" except seniors. ""It affects elderly people elderly people with heart problems and other problems. If they have other problems that's what it really affects that's it"" the president said at the time. “Nobody” Biden said on Tuesday. “Think about that. Who was he talking about when he said it affects virtually nobody. He was talking about America’s seniors. He was talking about you.” And speaking directly to voters age 65 and older the former vice president argued that Trump thinks “you’re expendable 'forgettable you’re virtually nobody. That’s how he sees seniors. ... The only senior that Donald Trump cares about … is the senior Donald Trump."" Biden also claimed the president will “undermine the Medicare trust fund and increase overall out of pocket costs for seniors.” And he charged that Trump “says he wants to lower drug prices but he hasn’t done a single thing to do it.”  The Trump campaign fired back arguing that “Biden resorted to his worn tactic of lying about President Trump who has steadfastly protected Social Security and Medicare and who has pledged to always do so.” HOW PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED IN THE 2020 ELECTION  Last week as he was recovering at the White House after being diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19 tweeted that seniors are “MY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD!”   And the announcer in the new Trump campaign commercial highlights that “President Trump protected Social Security and Medicare” and that Trump “lowered drug costs and during his first term Medicare Advantage premiums fell 34%.” Four years ago Trump narrowly edged out 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Florida. An average of some of the most recent polling in the state shows Biden holding a single-digit lead over the president. In a sign of how important the state is to the president’s reelection Trump’s spent three days campaigning in the state this week. “Seniors in Florida are critical to winning the state” noted Newhouse who was Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s pollster in the 2012 presidential campaign. “The key voter groups in the state would be seniors and Hispanics. A strong performance among seniors would go a long way towards giving the president an edge in the state.” And it’s not just Florida. Seniors make up at least 17% of the population in the battleground states of Arizona Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin Iowa and New Hampshire. The concentration by the two standard-bearers on seniors this week is welcome news to many. With America dealing with the most devastating pandemic in a century the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression more than 80 years ago the most intense and widespread protests and unrest over racial inequity in decades and arguably the most bitter U.S. Supreme Court confirmation battle in recent history it’s little wonder that some issues critical to seniors that usually dominate presidential elections have been pushed to the side in recent months.  “We’re certainly concerned that our issues have been overshadowed because when these things pass – and they will pass – the fundamental bedrock issues for Americans- things like their health taking care of aging parents Medicare prescription drug prices Social Security – those things are still going to be with us” AARP New Hampshire state director Todd Fahey told Fox News.  “It’s really important that the voters understand where each candidate stands on these singularly important issues” Fahey emphasized. “They are of great important to the nation and the candidates need to speak to all of them.” ", https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-biden-florida-court-crucial-senior-voters,0.8102894912526674

Biden's town hall on ABC happened parallel to a separate event on NBC with President Trump after a presidential debate initially scheduled for Thursday was canceled because Trump refused to participate in a virtual debate. Biden was quizzed by voters from both sides of the aisle and the forum was moderated by ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos.

""If there's actually real live debate on the floor if people are really going to be able to have a time to go through this -- you know I don't know anybody who has gone on the floor and just -- and that's been a controversial justice in terms of making -- fundamentally altering the makeup of the court that's gone through in a day kind of thing."" Biden added: ""It depends on how much they rush this."" Stephanopoulos asked Biden whether voters would have an answer on court-packing before Election day and Biden responded ""Yes depending on how they handle this."" Biden also said whether or not he would issue a national vaccine mandate ""depends on the state of the nature of the vaccine when it comes and how it's being distributed."" He noted there is a range of outcomes of how effective a vaccine might be and that distributing a vaccine to more than 300 million Americans is going to be a herculean task.  Stephanopoulos then asked Biden ""How could you enforce that?"" Biden replied that ""you couldn't that's the problem"" before seeming to imply that it's possible to have a quasi-mandate by requiring children to have a coronavirus vaccine before coming to school.  TRUMP: CONVINCING SUSAN COLLINS TO CONFIRM AMY CONEY BARRETT 'NOT WORTH THE WORK' ""You can't come to school until you have a measles shot"" Biden noted. ""You can't.""

Biden was clearer on other issues. He stated plainly that ""I do not propose banning fracking."" Biden also came out with one of his strongest condemnations of the ""Green New Deal"" to date contradicting the statement on his website which says ""Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face."" ""My deal is a crucial framework but not the new green deal"" Biden said. ""The new green deal calls for the elimination of all non-renewable energy by 2030. You can't get there.""

Danielle Martin and her family are calling the safe arrival of the twins “a miracle” after doctors reportedly said it would be “highly unlikely” that the babies would survive her battle with coronavirus SWNS reported. “It’s definitely a miracle for us” Bryan Green who shares three older boys with Martin told the news outlet. “They’re our wee princesses.” 4 CORONAVIRUS TREATMENTS INCLUDING REMDESIVIR HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE FLOP IN LARGE WHO STUDY It started on March 30 when Martin told Green she felt like she was suffocating. At the time she was nine weeks pregnant and thought she was expecting one baby. The 32-year-old was rushed to the hospital near their home in Belfast. She tested positive for COVID-19 and her condition soon deteriorated SWNS reported. “At first I thought I just had a sore throat which led to a bad chest and I thought it must be a chest infection but I could barely breathe after six days” she told SWNS. “It felt like I was suffocating so Bryan decided to call an ambulance who came within five minutes and took me away – I was terrified.” She was placed on a ventilator to help with her breathing but when her oxygen levels dropped they put her into an induced coma SWNS reported. CORONAVIRUS RISK LOWERED FOR THIS BLOOD TYPE STUDY SUGGESTS “I rang the hospital to say I needed to get in touch with my partner and a consultant came on the phone to tell me they’d rushed her up to the theater and put her in a coma” Green told the news outlet. “I was just speechless on the phone I didn’t know what to say it was madness.” Doctors allegedly then informed Green it would be “highly unlikely” for the baby to survive the ordeal. Research on coronavirus in pregnant women is ongoing. In the U.S. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that based on what is already known pregnant people may be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant people. Additionally COVID-19 may have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pre-term birth. SEATTLE-AREA MAN INFECTED WITH CORONAVIRUS TWICE Researchers say the outcomes thus far have been impacted by timing of infection during pregnancy severity of the disease and whether the newborn was also diagnosed with COVID-19. Two reports recently published on the virus’ impact on pregnant women showed that more than half of pregnant women infected with the virus were asymptomatic or showed no symptoms while 16% of the women included in one of the studies showed symptoms and 9% required invasive mechanical ventilation. Additionally pregnancy obesity and gestational diabetes were also found in higher prevalence among pregnant women who were hospitalized for COVID-19 illness. After 10 days Martin came out of the coma and the pair were informed that not only did her baby survive but that she was expecting two SWNS reported.   “I couldn’t believe it and I still can’t to this day even though I’m looking at them in front of me right now sleeping it’s unbelievable!” Green told the news outlet.

After not appearing on the big screen for 10 years the Oscar-winning actress is making her return to acting in a new movie titled “The Life Ahead.” The reason? The Netflix film was directed by her son Edoardo Ponti. “He knows me so well” the Hollywood star told Closer Weekly for its latest issue which is currently on newsstands. SOPHIA LOREN SAYS 'IT'S VERY DIFFICULT' TO DISCUSS THE #METOO MOMENT: 'IT DOES GIVE ME THE CHILLS THINKING ABOUT IT' “He knows every inch of my face my heart my soul” she shared. According to the outlet “The Life Ahead” stars Loren as Madame Rosa a Holocaust survivor living on the Italian coastal of Bari. She forms a special friendship with Momo a 12-year-old Senegalese immigrant boy. Edoardo told the outlet that he wasn’t surprised that such a role would move his famous mother. “She wants to put it all on the line to make a movie that is so deep so challenging both emotionally and physically” said the 47-year-old.

I think every day is an opportunity for life to do something you want to do. That inspires me… You just love yourself and you love what you do.” Loren also revealed she was perfectly content living in Geneva. “Geneva is very very close to Italy so I am never far away” she said. “When I’m in Rome I’m with my sister.

125,Gayle Benson Saints and Pelicans owner thwarts car theft attempt officials say," EXCLUSIVE: House Minority Whip Steve Scalise and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers lead more than a dozen House Republicans in demanding answers from Twitter for their “unparalleled” and “unprecedented” actions the social media platform took in reducing the circulation of a New York Post article about Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings and former Vice President Joe Biden’s alleged knowledge of those dealings. In a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Scalise R-La. McMorris Rodgers R-Wash. and 14 other House Republicans raised “significant concerns” with Twitter’s actions saying they show “a clear disregard for the spirit of the First Amendment and our country’s long history of open dialogue among citizens” calling it “the latest in a troubling pattern of actions taken by Twitter to target conservative viewpoints on its platform.” RNC FILES FEC COMPLAINT AGAINST TWITTER CLAIM COMPANY MADE 'ILLEGAL IN-KIND CONTRIBUTION' TO BIDEN CAMPAIGN “While it has been evidence for some time that Twitter and other social media platforms have acted with clear bias against conservative viewpoints and Republican politicians these latest actions represent an unacceptable escalation and threaten the future of our Democratic discourse” they wrote referencing Dorsey’s testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in 2018. McMorris Rodgers is the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee which has jurisdiction over tech companies like Twitter. She is also running to lead the full Energy and Commerce Committee in the next Congress.  “[Y]ou stated ‘Twitter does not use political ideology to make any decision’” they quoted Dorsey as saying. “Clearly this statement is patently false or the official posture of your company has changed.” They also claimed that during Dorsey’s time as CEO “it has become clear that Twitter has no qualms about using the power of its platform to selectively censor certain types of speech to advance a blatant political agenda.” The Republican lawmakers went on to question whether anyone at Twitter communicated with the Biden campaign or the Democratic Party prior to blocking access to the New York Post article this week while also requesting further information on the company’s hacked material policy. “If Twitter is concerned about the dissemination of ‘harmful content’ why then has Twitter failed to censor or block articles from China Daily or Iran’s tweets from Iran’s Supreme Leader seeking to undermine the United States or cause harm to its citizens?” They asked. The letter was signed by McMorris Rodgers Scalise and Republican Reps. Earl Carter Jeff Duncan Greg Gianforte David McKinley Larry Bucshon Robert Latta Tim Walberg Bill Flores Michael Burgess Bill Johnson H. Morgan Griffith Brett Guthrie Billy Long and Adam Kinzinger. FACEBOOK TWITTER LIMIT DISTRIBUTION OF NY POST HUNTER BIDEN STORY The controversy came after the New York Post obtained emails that reveal that Hunter Biden purportedly introduced his father to a top executive at Burisma Holdings in 2015. The Post report revealed that Biden at Hunter’s request allegedly met with Burisma adviser Vadym Pozharskyi in April 2015 in Washington D.C. The meeting was mentioned in an email of appreciation according to the Post that Pozharskyi sent to Hunter Biden on April 17 2015 — a year after Hunter took on his position on the board of Burisma and a year prior to Biden helping to push Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin out of his job. Shokin was investigating Burisma. “Dear Hunter thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent some time together. It’s realty [sic] an honor and pleasure” the email read. Biden and Biden allies have maintained though that his intervention prompting the firing of Shokin had nothing to do with his son but rather was tied to corruption concerns. The emails turned up in the hard drive of a laptop dropped off at a repair shop in 2019 the Post reported adding that a copy of the hard drive ended up in the hands of Robert Costello a lawyer for Rudy Giuliani a personal attorney for President Trump. The Biden campaign hit back on Wednesday: ""Investigations by the press during impeachment and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official U.S. policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing.” TWITTER LOCKS OFFICIAL TRUMP CAMPAIGN ACCOUNT AFTER SHARING HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO A Biden campaign spokesman said that Trump administration officials testified that the former vice president did not engage in wrongdoing. ""The New York Post never asked the Biden campaign about the critical elements of this story"" Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said. ""They certainly never raised that Rudy Giuliani -- whose discredited conspiracy theories and alliance with figures connected to Russian intelligence have been widely reported -- claimed to have such materials.” Bates said campaign officials also reviewed Biden's official schedules from the time and the meeting alleged by the New York Post did not take place. Meanwhile prominent Republicans including White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany as well as President Trump’s re-election campaign’s official Twitter account were suspended after attempting to share the link to the story. ""This is election interference plain and simple. For Twitter to lock the main account of the campaign of the President of the United States is a breathtaking level of political meddling and nothing short of an attempt to rig the election"" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News. ""Joe Biden’s Silicon Valley pals are aggressively blocking negative news stories about their guy and preventing voters from accessing important information. This is like something from communist China or Cuba not the United States of America.” Twitter said Wednesday the New York Post article was in violation of its ""hacked materials policy.” The company's 2018 policy prohibits the distribution of content ""obtained without authorization."" Twitter doesn't want to incentivize hacking or circulating ""possibly illegally obtained materials.” Twitter noted that once users remove the tweet in violation their account will be unlocked and they can continue tweeting.  By Friday Dorsey further clarified the company’s policy saying: “Straight blocking of URLs was wrong and we updated our policy and enforcement to fix.” He added: “Our goal is to attempt to add context and now we have capabilities to do that.” Meanwhile Fox News exclusively reported Friday that the Republican National Committee (RNC) on Friday filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) alleging that the censorship of the New York Post article about Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings and former Vice President Joe Biden’s alleged knowledge of those dealings amounts to an “illegal corporate in-kind political contribution” to the Biden campaign.  The RNC in its complaint said Twitter “is a partisan actor run by partisan Democrats” and is “using its corporate resources to provide active support for Joe Biden’s campaign in violation of federal law” and demanded the FEC “conduct an immediate investigation” into Twitter’s “illegal in-kind contributions to the Biden campaign” and “impose the maximum penalty allowed under the law.” Twitter did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.  ", https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scalise-mcmorris-rogers-demand-answers-twitter-hunter-biden-story,0.8103372648567896
126,Scalise McMorris Rodgers demand answers on Twitter's 'unprecedented' actions on Hunter Biden story, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito has been pushing to expand broadband access to rural communities for years.  “If I had all the money in the world and all the cooperation I would have broadband in every single house in this country” the West Virginia Republican told Fox News.  In 2015 she launched “Capito Connect” her initiative to deploy federal investments in broadband without the government mismanagement waste and fraud the state had suffered in previous years.  But in the heart of once-booming coal country Capito estimates that despite recent developments up to 25% of residents do not have reliable access to fast Internet an unthinkable prospect in more urban parts of the nation.  Other parts of the population have spotty access that is frequently cut off.  “We’ve realized during this pandemic that telehealth tele-education telecommuting -- these are all essentials to being able to cope really to keep a job going to keep education going to keep health care going” she said. COREY GARDNER'S 'BIG IDEA': KEEP UP WITH CHINA IN THE SPACE RACE  Capito believes the “digital divide” is what’s keeping West Virginia now one of the nation’s poorest states from transforming into the latest tech hub.  “We’ve got beautiful open spaces we’ve got the best outdoor recreation of anywhere on the East Coast” the Republican senator said. “We’ve learned from COVID that congested areas are a little difficult to deal with in circumstances such as this.”  Just last week Virgin Hyperloop a transportation technology company picked the state for a $500 million certification center and test track for billionaire Richard Branson’s super high-speed travel system.  The hyperloop system will be designed to whisk floating pods packed with passengers and cargo through vacuum tubes at 600 miles an hour (966 kmph) or faster. Construction is expected to begin in 2022 on the site of a former coal mine in Tucker and Grant counties with safety certification by 2025 and commercial operations by 2030 the company said. While West Virginia is getting its fair share in allocations from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) for broadband expansion Capito says much of the funding is still tied up in red tape.  She pointed to Webster County an extremely remote region in the state. The county was awarded a  $250000 grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) to expand broadband access over a year ago and yet the project has remained in limbo. REP. DOUG COLLINS' 'BIG IDEA': A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BLOCK COURT PACKING  “The hamstrings of how you get this government grant are really holding this back. We could’ve had this deployed by now if we just had a little common sense” the senator said.  In 2018 the West Virginia Development Office set aside $3.2 million in ARC funding for the agency’s broadband initiative. The funding was limited to ARC-designated distressed communities or those who suffered the hardest blow from the downturn of the coal industry. Among them was Webster.  In May Capito introduced the bipartisan- E-Bridge Act with Sen. Joe Manchin D-W.Va. to remove obstacles to broadband projects actually receiving funding from EDA grants. It would prompt public-private partnerships by giving communities more flexibility in complying with their funding match requirements. Capito in 2018 implored Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to bring rural Americans particularly in West Virginia internet connectivity. The Facebook CEO promised to follow up and in 2019 made good on his promise.  The social media platform brought its first fiber infrastructure program in North America right to West Virginia.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The high-capacity fiber optic cable network is part of a network infrastructure project expanding from Virginia to Ohio with 275 miles stretching across the southeastern region of the Mountain State the state’s “least served area.” Construction is expected to last 18 to 24 months. , https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-shelley-capitos-big-idea-expand-broadband-access-to-bring-tech-jobs-to-rural-america,0.8102970457413585
127,Sen. Shelley Capito's 'Big Idea': Expand broadband access to bring tech jobs to rural America," The Honest Elections Project is warning that recent events unfolding in states throughout the country have confirmed their fears that November's election will be mired in controversy because states changed their voting procedures without adequate time to develop a workable system. The group had warned in a July report that large-scale voting by mail would waste resources create a risk of complications such as fraud. TRUMP DIRECTS CALIFORNIA GOP TO 'FIGHT HARD' IN COURT OVER BALLOT BOXES DESPITE PROSECUTION THREAT ""Almost everything we warned of happened in multiple states throughout the primaries"" a new addendum to the report says. ""Rather than learn from these mistakes many states are repeating them."" The addendum points to lawsuits filed by liberal groups to force states into changing ballot deadlines that could result in late ballots being counted and counting others that could otherwise be invalid. One such case is awaiting a decision by the Supreme Court. Groups are also challenging election security laws such as witness requirements and prohibitions on ballot harvesting which the Honest Elections Project claims could result in confusion and a lack of confidence in the election results. ""Uncertainty and last-minute rules changes amplify the risk of delay and post-election litigation that could drag on for weeks cast doubt on the election’s outcome and possibly force states to miss the deadline to participate in the Electoral College disenfranchising millions"" the group said. MORE THAN 100 UNDELIVERED ABSENTEE BALLOTS FOUND IN KENTUCKY DUMPSTER The organization also expressed concern that the sheer number of absentee ballots now being cast is more than some states can handle if they did not already have the proper infrastructure in place. They cited an NPR report that revealed 550000 absentee ballots were rejected during this year's primary elections. Looking at November's election the Honest Elections Project pointed to ballot errors such as thousands in New York City that included envelopes made out to the wrong people and thousands of others sent to Los Angeles County residents that did not include the ability to vote for president. Honest Elections Project executive director Jason Snead told Fox News that the problems he has seen are ""mostly system-level problems"" as opposed to fraud but the report does refer to several incidents including the arrest of a New Jersey postal worker who allegedly dumped more than 1800 pieces of mail including 99 general election ballots.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Regardless of the intent or cause for problems Snead warned that the best way to ensure the integrity of the election is for people to vote in person if they are capable of doing so. He said that unless voters are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus they should vote in person either on Election Day or during early voting periods to avoid overwhelming their states' voting systems. ""We need to have absentee voting for vulnerable voters"" Snead said saying that others should vote in person or the strain on the system will be tremendous. ""Anyone who can vote in person"" he said ""will free up an absentee ballot effectively for those who need it.” ", https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-report-finds-string-of-ballot-mishaps-confirms-fears-of-large-scale-mail-in-voting,0.8103241635207792
128,New report finds string of ballot mishaps confirms fears of large-scale mail-in voting," On Wednesday the two vice-presidential candidates Sen. Kamala Harris D-Calif. and Mike Pence will face off for what is surely the most important vice presidential debate in recent memory. Even before President Trump went to Walter Reed National Medical Center to undergo treatment for COVID-19 it was clear Vice President Mike Pence had a clear task of damage control following Trump’s aggressive performance last week in his debate against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. While some believe that Biden himself had an uneven performance in that debate there’s clear evidence that the voters were more disappointed by the president. Analyzing polls of voters about debates is dangerous – voters tend to believe that “their candidate” did better and one should look at the results with that in mind. Still in the instant poll conducted by CNN fully 1 in 4 Trump supporters gave their candidate a bad grade (saying that Biden did better or they both did equally well) while only 1 in 15 Biden supporters gave their candidate a bad grade. JUDITH MILLER: DEMOCRATS HOPE TRUMP'S COVID MEDICAL MISFORTUNE IS THEIR POLITICAL GAIN Moreover the data from polls conducted after the debate and before the president's positive COVID diagnosis suggested some erosion in Trump's support. In polls conducted in Florida and Pennsylvania by the New York Times/Sienna College two-thirds of voters said they disapproved of Trump’s conduct in the debate where he frequently interrupted his opponent Biden and the moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News. Pence’s job is further complicated by the need to debate under the shadow of the president’s illness. On one level Pence’s job at the debate is the same as it was in his debate against Clinton’s running mate Senator Tim Kaine and the same as it has been for his entire term as vice president – provide the emotional and evangelical ballast for the unrestrained and raucously disruptive presidency of Donald Trump. Four years ago Pence very clearly won the debate – dominating Kaine and smoothing the edges off the rough performance of Trump in his first debate with Hillary Clinton. A CNN “instant poll” that night gave Pence the victory 48% to 42%. Moreover the Real Clear Politics averages of national polls during the period showed Clinton losing about a full percentage point. In a period when Trump was clearly bleeding – the ""Access Hollywood"" tape came out three days later – Clinton wasn’t gaining – and the only ‘good news’ the Republicans were getting came from Pence. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER This year his challenge is even steeper. Not only does he need to try to stem the erosion from President Trump’s debate performance – he also needs to try to overcome the confusing messages that the Trump White House has been sending about the president’s health. But even without the haphazard performance by the White House during the president's hospitalization there’s an overriding problem: the fact that the Trump team’s reluctance to embrace mask-wearing and other elements of social distancing appears may have helped cause the president’s COVID infection. Can Pence make the case that despite that contradiction a recovered-from-COVID Trump will be best able to overcome the economic fallout from the coronavirus? Arguably Pence – who is preternaturally able to stay on message with a fervor that would make former President Bill Clinton blush – may be the best Republican to make this case – and certainly the least likely to be thrown off message by anything that Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Kamala Harris seeks to throw at him. In many ways Harris has an even harder job than Pence Wednesday night. With the president still recovering from COVID at the White House – and with the Democrats campaigning on “unity” – it’s both emotionally inappropriate and politically unwise to simply attack the president. At the same time Harris does need to make the case that the president’s approach to COVID has both made the economic impact of the virus deeper – and may have contributed to many in the White House among the president’s team and within the Republican Senate ranks – getting infected. But she needs to do that with a grace that is very challenging for Democrats this year – given the deep antipathy that many of them feel about the president. During the campaign for the nomination Harris was one of the few who was able to land a punch on former Vice President Biden – when she attacked him for his position on school busing.

129,Arnon Mishkin: At VP debate understudies Harris and Pence look to protect the bosses -- it won't be easy," Oct. 9 2020 – This is a rush transcript from “The Ingraham Angle” October 9 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham and this is The Ingraham Angle on a busy Friday night. What else did you expect? Well given the historical bias and the recent hacking scandal involving moderator Steve Scully of C-SPAN. Should the Commission on Presidential Debates just be abolished at this point? Ari Fleischer and Mollie Hemingway have thoughts in moments. And Raymond Arroyo dissects a dizzying 24 hours of Biden from an odd riff on pregnancy to a doo whop event for boomers. Friday Follies brings us laughs as always. But first enemies of democracy. That's the focus of tonight's angle.  Nancy Pelosi made it official today she no longer believes that our system of government is a good idea.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Congress has a constitutional duty to lay out the process by which a president's incapacity and the president of any party is determined. This legislation applies to future presidents. But we are reminded of the necessity of action by the health of the current president.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: This was unbelievable today. But think about it. For months we've been hearing from Nancy and her pals how the whole country is systemically racist and it's been so since the founding. Ergo the millions who love this country and voted for Trump are also racists who put an evil bigot in the White House and they can't risk voters making that same decision again. Either this election or an election in the future so they're going to try to short circuit democracy under the guise of being faithful to the Constitution.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  PELOSI: This is not about President Trump; he will face the judgment of the voters. But he shows the need for us to create a process for future presidents. Throughout America's history our leaders have created and strengthened guardrails in the Constitution to ensure stability and continuity of government in times of crisis.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do need to do this now.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Now Pelosi's language is interesting. A process for future presidents. Well Trump noticed something very fishy about this wording as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The 25th Amendment that crazy Nancy is playing around. She's gone crazy. She's a nut job but this 25th Amendment. I think they put it in so they can get Kamala and replace Joe.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Exactly. That's exactly what it is. It's a trial run to see if they can kick Biden out. That's exactly right sir.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Trump was back to his fine form with Rush Limbaugh today and of course they're correct. What Pelosi and company are doing they're laying the groundwork to get rid of Biden and put Kamala in. Now I wonder what the former V.P. thinks about all of this. Does he understand it. The press should force him to answer this question. Joe what do you think. But I'm not going to hold my breath.  Now this isn't the first time Democrats have invoked the 25th Amendment and it won't be the last. So what does the amendment actually say about removing a sitting president. Well here you go. Whenever the vice president and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of other such body as Congress may by law provide transmit to the president pro tempore of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Reps their written declaration that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office the vice president shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as acting president.  Now remember this amendment was passed initially in the Cold War years when Congress was worried about the president being in let's say a coma if a nuclear war broke out and then the JFK assassination validated those fears for a lot of Americans. But are Democrats really motivated by patriotic national security concerns. Of course not.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): It's good for the president or at least the people in the White House most especially the Chief of Staff to realize that he is not going to be allowed to jerk the country around. This may be the kind of attention getter to that we need.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: What the Democrats are proposing. Stay with me. This is really important is putting the power to remove the sitting president in the hands of an unelected 17-member commission and the vice president. Eight would be medical professionals medical deep state and another eight would be former executive branch officials including former presidents.  Now both Democrats and Republicans would be able to appoint an equal number of members who would then those 16 choose the 17th member to chair the committee. So in theory this all sounds really bipartisan and fair but in reality this means the committee will be stacked with liberal or mostly establishment types and then shared like the 17th member chaired by someone like let's say a Colin Powell or Barack Obama or even Hillary Clinton. You know where that will go?  Well this is the Left's version of a somewhat like a Soviet Politburo that can exercise total control over the White House by continually dangling the threat of the president being declared unfit for office. And don't think for a second that the VP will always act as a check on this  I was thinking about my old boss Ronald Reagan today. Now he was an outsider. He ran as the anti-establishment candidate in 1976 and ultimately won the nomination against George Herbert Walker Bush in 1980. He picked the establishment guy George H.W. Bush as his VP. Could you have seen a scenario where Bush would have immediately under the Pelosi idea of the 25th Amendment would immediately started to undermine Reagan from the outset under the scenario you don't even want to tempt a vice president tempt him with something like this or her.  It is glaringly obvious how dangerous this would be to our system of government so much so that even CNN I love this is begging Pelosi change course now.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're doing this which is not going to go anywhere but not holding a press conference on a stimulus deal and not getting something done for the millions of American people who are waiting on lawmakers to stop fighting. I don't know what it's like to not be able to pay their rent or feed their families.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Pelosi doesn't often make this type of political mistake but she has totally lost control of her caucus just like she did when she pursued impeachment. Remember that's what the squad wanted. And as we saw with impeachment there were almost no Democrats were willing to dissent out of fear that they'll be primaried by an AOC supported candidate. They don't want to be primaried by the gang of radicals.  So if you tonight have a Democrat representing you and your district or who is running as a so-called moderate against an incumbent remember this is what you're supporting what Pelosi pushed today the complete undermining of our electoral process. Look at what they're already planning. They're going to pack the courts; they're going to pack the House and Senate with D.C. statehood and maybe other places as well. They'll cede control over our borders total open borders trade energy health policies. They'll give all that decision making to a lot of international bodies.  I think in the end the Democrats they never forgave you and America who voted for Donald Trump. And now they want to make sure that nothing like that happens again and they want to dissuade another populist another true rebel from taking office or even running for office.   This will likely go the way of Peter Strzok's insurance policy though.  Remember they thought the deep state in the media would be enough to take out Trump but it wasn't. Now this is their new insurance policy the 25th Amendment. This will just create continual constitutional crises and a permanent state of chaos which is exactly what the Democrats want.  All designed to get you to just be so fed up that you give up on America.  But we will not do that. Big mistake Nancy and that's the angle.  Joining me now is Ari Fleischer former White House Press Secretary and Mollie Hemingway senior editor at the Federalist. Both are Fox News contributors. Mollie let's start with you. And we talked about this the other night when you were on just like packing the court the press has to ask these questions about whether Biden and his campaign do they agree with this move and not let them get away with saying well I'll tell you when I get elected.   MOLLIE HEMINGWAY SENIOR EDITOR THE FEDERALIST: There's this contradiction between what the media claimed the Biden campaign is about which they claim it's moderate and a return to normalcy and what's actually happening in the Democratic Party as you laid out with this 25th Amendment plan.  I think Nancy Pelosi was trying to highlight that President Trump had recently been in the hospital and it wasn't meant to be as serious as it's being taken. And instead it's highlighting other problems for her such as that. Joe Biden picked a vice presidential candidate who does not seem particularly loyal to him and that people could envision someone like Kamala Harris quickly using something like this in order to gain the presidency.  But that 25th Amendment discussion has been very damaging. And it actually goes back to the very first week of the Trump administration when the Atlantic published something about using it to oust President Trump and the media and Democratic figures just keep revisiting it over and over again as part of their inability to accept the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election to accept that Americans chose as their president Donald Trump and to do everything in their power to fight it.   INGRAHAM: They are seething still Ari all these years later four years later that the public did not choose Hillary and they chose this rough and tumble guy who's going to shake up the whole establishment. But I've got to say today on MSNBC Craig Melvin and Pelosi started discussing this. I want you to analyze it for us. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CRAIG MELVIN MSNBC HOST: To be clear because a lot of folks are wondering the speaker of the House does not think at this point that the President of the United States should transfer power.  PELOSI: No I don't think the president should.  MELVIN: You don't think he needs to transfer power right now just because he's--   PELOSI: That's not my judgment.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Of course aside from the fact that she's touching her mask like five times and totally contaminating it Ari as they all do. What about this? She answers no I do think the president should when he asks. So do you think he should transfer power now? Very odd.   ARI FLEISCHER FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well first and foremost Laura I think we need the exact same commission for future speakers male or female who get set up by their hairdressers. Anybody who can't control their hair dressing we've got to have a commission look at whether they are capable of being a speaker. It's a very hairy job and you have to be good at it.  Look this is how meaningless this exercise is today. She's left something out and it's called the Constitution. Under the Constitution if somebody deems that the president is unfit for office under the 25th Amendment they seek to remove them either by congressional act or by half the cabinet saying he should be removed. The president under the Constitution then replies in writing and says no I am capable of serving.  Once the president replies and says that it takes two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the Senate to remove the president. It's a higher harder bar than impeachment. So this one is even passed Nancy Pelosi's house. If they tried to do this to a president at least to President Trump.  So it's a completely meaningless exercise. It's bad politics. I really don't get why she did this and then exempts Trump from it. It's just weird.  It does make you think does this apply to Biden and Harris and asked for this transfer of power? She took both sides of it. And so the press does have to dig in. What she says doesn't make sense.   INGRAHAM: Well I have to get your thoughts on this too. There's another controversy regarding the next debate. moderator C-SPAN's Steve Scully.  Now on Twitter Scully openly asked Trump hater Anthony Scaramucci should I respond to Trump after the president questioned whether or not Scully was nonpartisan?  So everyone speculated that if he meant to send it as a private message.  But here's how the debate commission responded. They said Steve Scully did not originate the tweet and believes his account has been hacked. The Commission on Presidential Debates has stated publicly that the tweet was not sent by Scully himself and investigating it with the help of authorities.  Mollie this controversy aside doesn't this call into question the entire notion of this presidential debate commission given the fact that Republicans always seem to get hosed on the moderators?   HEMINGWAY: The presidential debate commission has had a horrible year. And another thing that happened today is that former presidential candidate Bob Dole said that he knows that the commission is supposed to be bipartisan and he knows all the Republicans that are associated with it. He doesn't know any of them who support Trump and he thinks that is unfair that was a brave thing for him to come out and say that. And this is an issue that you're talking about earlier when the establishment is all on one side of an issue that is not good for the American people.  This debate commission has not done a good job of reflecting the current moment of hosting debates where people can actually talk about where what they believe how they differ from other people. And in part I think it's just because it's somewhat antiquated and they haven't freshened up who's advising them and also who is on their board might not represent actual voters in any meaningful sense. They need to do something drastic. They need to do if they if they want to have any role in the future. And they are really behaving poorly right now.   INGRAHAM: Ari your thoughts on this?   FLEISCHER: Well I know Steve Scully and I've defended him I have always found him to be impartial neutral and fair and-- INGRAHAM: He's always been incredibly nice to me personally.  FLEISCHER: Yes and fair professionally which I think ought to be said.  Now I don't know his politics. I really don't. I do accept that almost everybody who gets these jobs is cut from the same establishment cloth of which I work for many politicians who are establishment. And that's why Susan Page ask the question she did. Her questions were all about Trump said this which was offensive trolleybus-- INGRAHAM: Horrible.  FLEISCHER: Which was bad. You know what she didn't say to Kamala Harris?  What was your reaction when Joe Biden said you ain't black to a radio announcer? What was your reaction when Joe Biden said blacks don't have diversity? She didn't pick up on any of Biden's dumb statements and whole Kamala Harris account for them.  And that's my beef with these reporters. They come from the same liberal mindset which is where Republicans are always put on the defensive for the things that they do and say Democrats get a pass. And if the debate commission keeps serving it up that way and they don't go to alternative media which today's era where full of. Then I really do think the debate commission's usefulness comes into question it'll be hard to replace them for a bunch of reasons but their fundamental mission they need to re- examine.   INGRAHAM: Well most committees Mollie I tend to be against committees that are commissions that I don't know what's good. Mollie really quickly the president's going to have his first rally post-COVID diagnosis presumably on Monday in Sanford Florida it says it's going to be big and massive. How significant will this be and what tone should he strike?   HEMINGWAY: Well particularly given the other constraints involved with this year I think rallies are very important for President Trump in the final few weeks of this campaign. And as for tone it seems like he is enthusiastic his fans are enthusiastic and there are a lot of big issues that where I think President Trump might have learned from how Vice President Pence handled himself in this last debate talking about all those successes that the Trump administration has had is something that should be helpful in the closing weeks of this campaign.   INGRAHAM: Yes I don't think Russia gate as frustrating as that is. And Comey and Brennan no woman is going to vote for Trump because of Russia gate and his getting unfairly treated in the whole Mueller thing I mean they're just not going they're going to vote for jobs security safety and schools have got to open. That's what moms care about in my view. That's the least moms I know care about.  Ari and Mollie great to see you. Have a wonderful weekend. And coming up the Left's push for nationwide COVID contact tracing isn't just some benign public health agenda. We're going to show you how it's handed unchecked power to governments now across the globe. Plus one of the country's top infectious disease experts is here. He's going to blow the whistle on a medical and media cover up of a potentially life-saving drug. Stay there.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  INGRAHAM: What's the end game of all the COVID fear mongering? We've had our ideas and we think there's an agenda here and it's stripping away your freedoms and just a massive expansion of a new permanent surveillance state. Think China. Think I'm exaggerating. Well the article in The Guardian paints a vivid picture of where over-the-top COVID panic could take us.  Surveillance tools and technology such as fever detection goggles and drones that monitor curfews and lockdowns and apps that do track the spread of COVID are already being deployed as part of permanent laws and countries including Cambodia China of course Pakistan and Thailand.  Joining me now is Wesley Smith Discovery Institute Senior Fellow and National Review Contributor. Wesley people kind of - well they criticized the angle heavily back in April and May when we started to raise the warning flag about the tracking apps. And they say this is never going to happen here. The motivations are truly benevolent and health oriented. Is that necessarily true?   WESLEY SMITH DISCOVERY INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW: No I don't think so. And just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not really after you Laura. History teaches us that. You find now that there is a great deal of push for mandates by government. And part of this is not just government but you're going to have the private sector also enforcing these issues.  For example there was an article on August 6th in the USA Today by three very prominent bioethicists calling for a mandatory vaccine. And let me read just real quickly a few of the things that they said would be required. And this is a quote vaccine refusers could lose tax credits or be denied non-essential government services health insurers could levy higher premiums. You wouldn't be able to go into private businesses unless you showed your vaccine papers. This is advocacy preparing the ground for that kind of a draconian and I would have to say soft authoritarian type of existence enforced by the private sector.  And then you have Dr. Anthony Fauci. Now I've never been in the anti- Anthony Fauci chorus but then he wrote a piece in a science journal. He co-authored it in a journal called Cell. And he is saying-- INGRAHAM: Let me read it for everybody here because this is part of what he said. Living in greater harmony with nature will require changes in human behavior as well as other radical changes that may take decades to achieve. Rebuilding the infrastructures of human existence. We will need to prioritize changes in those human behaviors that constitute risks for the emergence of infectious diseases. Wesley explain that rebuilding the infrastructures of human existence.   SMITH: First he said we have to expand the power of the United Nations and the World Health Organization to accomplish this and then what he's basically talking about is an international - sorry about that an international technocracy in which the international bureaucrats would be able to establish this kind of draconian imposition where we have to change our entire lifestyles we have to change the way we live. We have to change our water systems. We have to change the way we travel and that kind of thing. It's just the most remarkable call for an authoritarian imposition internationally.   And it got almost no attention. I was stunned when I read this Cell is a very respected science journal. But this wasn't about science. This was about ideology.   INGRAHAM: So this is globalist social engineering.  SMITH: Yes on stilts you know as the old saying goes on steroids it's really a remarkable call by one of the most respected people in this country dealing with COVID. And he's not dealing with COVID in this. He's saying that basically what we have to do is prepare for the next pandemic.  And so this would be a permanent condition because supposedly we're entering into the era of pandemics and this is how we're going to have to live to try to keep safe.  I don't want to be a surf. I want to have to be a free person and make my own decisions. I'm not against of course reasonable public health laws but things like remaking the entire human infrastructure as far as I'm concerned should be off the table from the beginning.  INGRAHAM: It's a communist superstructure hiding as a or masquerading as health precautions. And I'm sorry but we're a sovereign and free people and we're going to stay a sovereign and free people if I think good people have anything to say about it. It's important conversation to have. Thank you so much. It's great to see you tonight.   Two media stories two miraculous stories of COVID recovery. Now if you're looking for info on the treatment that saved the lives in these incredible tales don't count on the press. The write ups in The Washington Post and a local New Jersey paper credit the power of prayer. Believe me we're all for the power of prayer and a little luck.  But my next guest says that's not the whole story and says that the media well they're covering up the fact that those people those patients made their stunning recoveries while taking the drug hydroxychloroquine. Dr.  Stephen Smith founder of the Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health the man behind those two life-saving treatments joins me now.  Dr. Smith what's the motivation for leaving out the fact in these media accounts that both patients were put on doses of HCQ?   DR. STEPHEN SMITH INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST: Hello. Good evening.  Actually the third even report in the press about patients that got better. Our patients - my team and myself took care of that. We use hydroxychloroquine to them in New Jersey the New Jersey news one and the third one actually were seen by another team first infectious disease team.  I can't really imagine why. I mean the piece in The Washington Post that the patient I went to bat for and put my career on the line for. That's the patient I referred to earlier when I talked about having fights about with the administration at the hospital I was working at and having fights with them about using the dose recommended by the French group. They wanted me to stop it after 24 milligrams of hydroxychloroquine.  I don't know the motivation. I can't speak to it. I can tell you that in the lap of the articles photo half of those people never saw the patient.  It was actually - the reward of course of being a doctor is not press and you know the name Mike Smith. I don't really care about my name being out there. I do care that they're not talking about the truth. And the truth is that woman and the other two patients were men both got high doses of hydroxychloroquine.  INGRAHAM: They both got high doses of hydroxychloroquine they both recovered neither fact was reported in the press. Now Dr. Smith the New England Journal of Medicine just released a study claiming that among patients who were not undergoing mechanical ventilation at the baseline those in the hydroxychloroquine group had a higher frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. In other words another negative study supposedly or review of hydroxy. Your response?   SMITH: I mean it's the recovery trial that's the Great Britain trial that's a trial that got all the fanfare when it came out saying dexamethasone saves lives. That same study on the dexamethasone part of it said that if you were on oxygen and you got dexamethasone you did worse physically significantly worse. That's inconsistent. It doesn't make sense to me. So those problems with the coverage and I'm trying to figure them out.   But I do also know they did not use azithromycin which we try to use on our patients. Not all our patients get azithromycin because the doctors won't give it if the patient is in the ICU. They'll sometimes restrict the use of azithromycin. But I was stunned by that they have inconsistent results. And our results are not inconsistent and I'll show those data in full later but we know that patients that get hydroxychloroquine azithromycin at a higher dose. I said high dose. I should correct that. The dose that is recommended by the French regimen and the dose that we use for a total dose is much lower than any lupus takes in one month. And they take it --  INGRAHAM: Again Dr. Smith and also these people in this recovery study were given the hydroxychloroquine late in the disease. They were already mechanically being ventilated. So everyone has to understand as a prophylaxis or early after you test positive or early that's where people had seen better results. Obviously Dr. Smith that's where you see the best result. People have to understand what they're looking at.  I've got to tell you another thing Dr. Smith I'm so glad you're on tonight because the media are refusing to report good news about the recent trends we're seeing for COVID. For example according to the CDC's latest figures COVID hospitalizations are decreasing we're putting it up on the screen for all age groups especially for those 65 years and over.  Look at this. What does this tell you about where we are with the pandemic?  Look at those lines for every age group and especially the older Americans Dr. Smith?  SMITH: Like I said doctors are best at not trying to predict things but following the past. Our experience in the New York area the New Jersey New York area was about a nine week pandemic. And I assumed based on not knowledge but experience that our area wouldn't be any different than other areas.  INGRAHAM: Dr. Smith wonderful to see you. Sorry we've got to hop but fascinating on the patients that you treated and what the press is leaving out about these seemingly miraculous recoveries.  And up next celebrities strip down for your vote -- what? Biden recruits rappers and Hillary Clinton finds a new outlet for her election grieving.  Raymond Arroyo has it all. Friday Follies next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ANITA VOGEL FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This is a FOX News weather alert. I'm Anita Vogel in Los Angeles. Hurricane Delta now a category one storm as it moves inland along Louisiana's southwestern coast tonight. Delta made landfall as a category two storm about three hours ago near Creole with top winds of 100 miles per hour. One hour later its wind speed has dropped to 90 miles per hour. This is the second hurricane to hit the gulf coast in just six weeks. Delta blew ashore in an area where devastation remains widely evident from hurricane Laura which caused at least 27 deaths. Meteorologists warn Delta though weakening remains a threat to lives and property. Storm surges could still reach up to 11 feet. Flash flood warnings are in place for much of the southwest Louisiana and parts of neighboring Texas. We'll be keeping an eye on Delta throughout the night.  I'm Anita Vogel. Now back to Laura Ingraham.  INGRAHAM: It's Friday and that means it's time for Friday Follies.  Democrats reach out to voters in unorthodox ways and a former candidate reemerges. Joining us with all the tantalizing details is Raymond Arroyo FOX News contributor author of ""The Spider Who Saved Christmas."" Raymond Biden is taking nothing for granted is he. RAYMOND ARROYO FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well and he's apparently leaving nothing to the imagination Laura. A group of celebrities are trying to warn voters about inaccurately submitted balance or naked ballots as they're called by appearing in the buff.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm naked.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am completely -- naked.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm naked. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm like naked.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There isn't a man behind me. These are my hands.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know what you're thinking. You're thinking Ruffalo put your clothes on. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm here to talk you about voting.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Please vote.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Take your clothes off and vote.  (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Laura this is what desperation looks like OK. When all else fails take your clothes off. This ad comes the same week that a YouTube celebrity lost her verification for promising nude pictures to anyone who voted for Joe Biden. But this Hollywood crowd of nudists they actually encourage people to vote for Trump. If Schumer and Gad keep their clothes I'd vote for Michael Dukakis at this point OK. It's scary. That is a frightening ad I've got to tell you.  INGRAHAM: In a president don't we just need the bare essentials like be a commander -- all of the jokes. Come on Raymond. ARROYO: Commando in chief. (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: We don't want to think about them without their clothing let alone see them with any of their clothing missing.  Now Biden Raymond he was campaigning in the west this week where he seemed stripped of any sense.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Do you realize before we passed Barack and I passed the law pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition? Not a joke. Insurance companies were allowed to charge more for a woman for the same exact medical procedure than a man would have. Same one.  (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER)  INGRAHAM: What? ARROYO: So much for following the science Laura. I think Biden is probably just having a senior moment. In fact his campaign did a full scale outreach to seniors today. They called it Boomers for Biden Rockn Doo Wop Party. This is what the seniors got.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAY SIEGEL MUSICIAN: If you can give me my note I'll see if I can still hit the falsetto.  Joe and Kamala Joe and Kamala let's vote Trump away.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Oh my God.  (LAUGHTER) ARROYO: Laura I've got to tell you now their trading notes begging people to vote and donate and they'll sing little bits of song. There is a part of me that thinks this is real smart campaigning though on one hand.  They hide the candidate and they get these celebrities to go out to targeted groups and try to pull voters in this case seniors in.  Meanwhile the Biden people are apparently worried about the black vote.  They rolled out Michelle Obama earlier this week and they're now recruiting Jay-Z Monica and Ludacris to turn out African-American voters.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's going on. This is Ludacris and I'm here to tell you that your vote matters. Your vote has power. Vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Laura in some way Ludacris could be the perfect Biden surrogate.  In his music video the one he's famous for ""Get Back"" he marched with a mob as a neighborhood burns behind him. So you see there is brand cohesion here. You have got to see all the angles.  INGRAHAM: That actually makes a lot of sense.  By the way Raymond back to the doo-wop deal with the boomers I thought for a moment I was watching one of those ""Time Life"" if you call right now you get ten CDs.  (LAUGHTER) ARROYO: The old ""Time Life"" where there are usually two people sitting around remember the good old days? Remember the good old days? Oh no that was tragic. What else? ARROYO: This being Friday Laura and Friday Follies CNN correspondent Joe Johns had a run in with a raccoon this week at the White House just before he went on air. Watch this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE JOHNS CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Look. Get!  There he is.  No events on the president's schedule today.  Fricking racoons man. It always comes around right about when I'm going to go on TV. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) ARROYO: Laura we have exclusive video a photo actually that might explain why this raccoon went on the attack. There it is. It's a MAGA raccoon Laura. You never know what you're going to find there on the grounds of the White House.  In truth a lot of these crews along Pebble Beach there in front of the White House have been attacked by these raccoons so maybe they're working for the Trump administration maybe they're not. We don't know.  INGRAHAM: They're still trying to figure out the fly on Pence's head so maybe the raccoon will jump on Pelosi next time she does another 25th Amendment press conference.  All right Raymond before we go I came across a podcast this week that neither you or any of our viewers probably ever asked for or would need.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON (D) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hi there I'm Hillary Clinton host of the new podcast ""You and Me Both."" I've spent these last few months doing something I love which is sitting down with smart funny interesting people to hear about their lives their careers and the biggest issues of our time. And I'm thrilled to invite you to join us.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: First of all it's ""you and I both.""  ARROYO: Laura this should have been called -- well this could have been called you and me both wish we were Michelle Obama. That's what this is.  This is clearly Hillary trying to play catch up with Michelle who's got her big podcast. And you know what here's the good news. Hillary has officially left the 2020 campaign. This is -- INGRAHAM: All right Raymond. You and I both grammar grammar grammar.  ARROYO: You and I both. INGRAHAM: Coming up -- thank you Raymond. Coming up how is BLM targeting sports and how far could they go? Jason Whitlock explains it all next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Are Christian athletes and coaches the next targets for the Black Lives Matter movement? If that seems farfetched this shocking story may change her mind. A few weeks ago Illinois State football coach Kurt Beathard son of the legendary Redskins general manager Bobby Beathard discovered a BLM sign taped to his office door. Since BLM's ethos ran contra to his Christian faith Beathard took the sign down and replaced it with one that said all lives matter to our lord and savior Jesus Christ.  It's a beautiful message to most but this was hate speech according to BLM radicals. Of course it was. After a sustained pressure campaign Beathard lost his coaching position.  Joining me now is Jason Whitlock partner and columnist at the fabulous ""Outkick"" . Jason it wasn't too long ago that outward shows of faith were commonplace among athletes and coaches. So is this now a Black Lives Matter chilling effect on that expression?  JASON WHITLOCK PARTNER AND COLUMNIST ""OUTKICK"": No question about it Laura. And this has been the intent of Black Lives Matter from the very beginning. We're seeing reshape right before our eyes the hostility towards Christianity is overtaking the sports world and Kurt Beathard is paying the price.  INGRAHAM: Isn't it the case that in all kind of Bolshevik or Marxist takeovers you have to take out faith because the faith has to reside Travis only in government. So the government is the almighty. The government becomes the orthodoxy. And that orthodoxy can't be challenged by anything higher which in this case is our savior Christ the Lord. That's to whom the Christian's answer not to the heads of BLM.  WHITLOCK: If you want to usher in immorality you have to usher out God.  And that's what's happening in America. And it's a calculated it's not an organic deal. This has been underway for years. Look at just what look at the immorality as it relates to Kurt Beathard. His wife died this summer of cancer. His nephew was shot and killed here in Nashville Tennessee outside of a bar. In what society does an employer looking at an employee that lost his wife and his nephew in the past few months fires the guy removes him from his job because he expresses his Christian faith and does something objectionable to what's popular now this Black Lives Matter movement? What Illinois state has done here is immoral. You have got to usher out God to usher in immorality.  INGRAHAM: I think it also might be illegal. I imagine the coach has a strong claim a religious bias claim. They get any state funding they're in trouble. So I hope he has a good lawyer. Lin Wood call your office. And Jason Clemson head football coach Dabo Swinney had something interesting to say about the slogans the Black Lives Matter slogans that are being put on players uniforms.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DABO SWINNEY CLEMSON UNIVERSITY HEAD FOOTBALL COACH: I'm a very traditional guy. I came from Alabama. I've always just not messed with uniforms. That was all changed this year.  I'm on board with a lot of the messages. I'm not on board with political organizations. I am apolitical. To me that's divisive.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Jason you say Swinney is BLM's next target?  WHITLOCK: He potentially could be. He's probably their biggest target. He is a very traditional faith-based coach right in line with Tom Landry former coach of the Dallas Cowboys Vince Lombardi with the Packers Joe Gibbs with the Washington Redskins Tom Osborne with Nebraska. Dabo Swinney is the next iteration of that. He wears his faith on his sleeve. They're going to eventually have a problem. And his team is highly successful.  Other than Alabama it's the most successful program in college football and the guy is doing it from a faith-based point of view and perspective.  He will eventually come under attack.  INGRAHAM: Jason thank you for this perspective. It's something that people better start talking about and focusing on now before it's too late. I hope to see you soon. WHITLOCK: Thank you.  INGRAHAM: Joe Biden is attracting all sorts of washed up actors and activists. The Last Bite explains.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: With all the famous actors and politicians already backing his campaign why would Biden want two hacks to cut an ad for him?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For his take on the election welcome Bill Kristol.  BILL KRISTOL: Thank you. It's really good to be with you. BILLY CRYSTAL ACTOR: Hello everybody. It's so nice to be -- what are you doing here?  KRISTOL: What are you doing here?  CRYSTAL: They introduced me. They said Billy Crystal.  KRISTOL: I think they said Bill Kristol.  CRYSTAL: Vote Biden. KRISTOL: Vote Biden. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Remember with the Democrats you're always stuck in the end with the bills.

130,Is Pelosi laying the groundwork to make Kamala Harris president?, A New Jersey officer was off duty when he refused to pull over and then led police on a dangerous high-speed chase prosecutors said. Andres Morales a member of the Saddle Brook Police Department has been charged with eluding police in connection with the Oct. 3 incident in Ridgefield N.J. Bergan County Prosecutor Mark Musella said Thursday. It began with the 29-year-old Morales getting caught speeding in a BMW around 2:35 a.m. and then refusing to submit to a traffic stop he said. NEW JERSEY COP SAVES BABY WHO WAS CHOKING AND 'TURNING BLUE' He eventually got away when when the pursuing officer called off the chase he said. “The pursuit was later terminated due to the excessive speed and the danger to the pursuing officer and the general public” the prosecutor said. WOMAN LEADS COPS ON HIGH-SPEED CHASE AFTER UNUSUAL REQUEST Morales was arrested Wednesday. He was also suspended from his duties as an officer. Saddle Brook Police Chief Robert Kugler told the Newark Star-Ledger two other members of the department were suspended as part of the investigation including a lieutenant. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP “This is a serious matter and should it be confirmed as reported I would be extremely disappointed not only in Officer Morales but equally disappointed and disturbed by other officers who may have had direct and/or indirect involvement in the circumstances of this serious matter” Kugler told the paper. , https://www.foxnews.com/us/off-duty-new-jersey-cop-high-speed-chase,0.8103637193104746
131,Off-duty New Jersey cop accused of leading police on high-speed chase," President Trump's campaign manager Bill Stepien predicts that the key to reelection lies with winning the state of North Carolina.  Stepien outlined three paths to victory all of which hedge on winning a state where Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden are neck and neck in the polls.  LONG LINES FORM OUTSIDE EARLY VOTING LOCATIONS ACROSS TRIANGLE Stepien told campaign staff that he is confident that Trump will clinch Ohio Florida Georgia Iowa and Maine’s second congressional district dubbing it the  ""easy part” of the election competition according to reporting by Axios. The campaign predicts the most likely path to victory is if Trump wins a combination of Arizona and North Carolina along with either Pennsylvania or Michigan.  Another and less likely alternative does not include Arizona but sweeping North Carolina Michigan and Nevada.  In recent weeks Trump has pulled $17 million in spending on advertisements in key states Ohio Iowa and New Hampshire which also have close races with Biden and which may be pivotal to winning the necessary 270 electoral votes.  WHICH STATE HAS REMOVED THE MOST CONFEDERATE SYMBOLS DURING NATIONWIDE PROTESTS? The incumbent has however upped ad spending in Florida Georgia North Carolina Pennsylvania and Arizona with an additional $18 million allocated to those states.  Meanwhile Biden's camp has poured $36 million in TV and radio ads in states across the map including Texas Georgia Ohio and Iowa which is double Trump’s spending in those states according to Advertising Analytics an ad-tracking firm.

132,Trump campaign says winning this state is vital to clinching election," C-SPAN announced Thursday it had suspended political editor Steve Scully indefinitely after he admitted he lied about his Twitter account being hacked but the scandal has also renewed interest in hacker claims once made by MSNBC host Joy Reid -- and some critics think C-SPAN handled the issue properly while MSNBC fell flat.    ""Scully was held to a higher standard because he and C-SPAN purported to be neutral responsible journalists acting in a non-partisan manner. There is no such presumption or pretense for Joy Reid and MSNBC” Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson told Fox News.  C-SPAN SUSPENDS STEVE SCULLY INDEFINITELY AFTER HE ADMITS HE LIED ABOUT HIS TWITTER BEING HACKED  Scully who was set to moderate the since-canceled presidential debate lied after a message to former Trump aide-turned-adversary Anthony Scaramucci went viral. It appeared that he meant to send Scaramucci a private message seeking advice about Trump but instead sent the message on his Twitter feed for everyone to see. He initially claimed his account was hacked but ultimately fessed up and was swiftly suspended.   It wasn’t the first time a prominent media member blamed hackers for something that landed them in hot water.   Back in late 2017 it was revealed that the Reid’s pre-MSNBC blog “The Reid Report” contained dozens of homophobic and hateful posts. She initially apologized but when a second batch of offensive comments surfaced ‒ about some lesbians' short haircuts and her objections to seeing men kiss men among other homophobic remarks ‒ Reid then claimed she’d been hacked and MSNBC circulated a much-panned statement from a computer hacking “expert” which sought to make that case.  MEDIA LARGELY AVOIDS STEVE SCULLY CONTROVERSY TV NETWORKS SKIP DEBATE MODERATOR'S 'HACK' CLAIM Upon scrutiny skeptics said Reid’s claims didn’t pass muster. The Daily Beast which had suspended Reid as a contributor conducted its own investigation and concluded that claims made by Reid’s cyber-security expert Jonathan Nichols that “screenshot manipulation” took place were false.  Critics have pointed to the Internet archival service The Wayback Machine which showed that the anti-gay articles were preserved at the time they were written and refuted the suggestion that hackers could have manipulated their archives. Others joked that time-traveling hackers must have been responsible.  She has since maintained that she does not remember writing the hateful posts but apologized anyway. Some were quick to criticize Reid’s apology for not mentioning the dubious hacker claims -- for which she reportedly alerted the FBI about the hacking “crime.” Reid has since been promoted and hosts the weekday timeslot long occupied by Chris Matthews’ “Hardball” until he left the network amid sexual misconduct allegations.  MSNBC BREAKS SILENCE ON STAR JOY REID’S ‘HATEFUL’ BLOG POSTS: ‘SHE HAS GROWN AND EVOLVED’ When asked about the scandal by the New York Times earlier this year Reid said “It’s two years ago so I don’t spend a whole lot of time thinking about that old blog. What I genuinely believe is that I truly care about the L.G.B.T. people in my own life. I care about being a good ally a good person and making sure that my voice is authentic that I can make a difference.""  MSNBC stood by Reid throughout the ordeal and did not immediately respond when asked if the network still maintains that her blog was hacked.   Back in 2018 MSNBC issued a statement after weeks of silence on the issue and said Reid ""has grown and evolved in the many years since"" since the hateful blog posts were published.  Fox News contributor Deroy Murdock agrees that the two different ways the hacker claims were handled indicates C-SPAN has higher standards than the progressive cable news network.   MSNBC PROMOTES JOY REID TO TAKE OVER WEEKNIGHT SLOT LEFT VACANT BY CHRIS MATTHEWS  ""While C-Span is not exactly conservative it remains fair and balanced. That's probably why they suspended political editor Steve Scully for lying about his Twitter account being hacked which it turns out it wasn't” Murdock told Fox News.   “Meanwhile MSNBC's far-Left Joy Reid claimed to have had her [blog] hacked even though evidence of that is about as scant as the ‘proof’ that failed actor Jussie Smollett was attacked by racist white Trump supporters on a frigid night in Chicago last year” Murdock added referencing reports Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to rough him up to garner sympathy and a better TV contract. Regardless Reid has enjoyed promotions and an even higher profile at MSNBC.”   While Reid appologized the lack of transparency about her hacker claim left Murdock unsatisfied.  “This confirms yet again that being on the Left means never having to say you're sorry"" Murdock said.  Media Research Center vice president Dan Gainor thinks C-SPAN did the right thing by suspending Scully but wonders if there will be long-term consequences.   “C-SPAN moved against Scully because their organization actually tries to have some ethics. MSNBC gave up on those long ago. They gave blatant liar Brian Williams his own show for goodness sakes. They only care that their hosts hate Trump” Gainor told Fox News.   “The bigger question for both networks is: are there long-term consequences to making false claims like this? Scully has claimed he’s been hacked multiple times. Reid’s bogus narrative involved the FBI” Gainor added. “Will either of their employers disavow this garbage?  Scully issued a statement addressing his controversy to CNN following the announcement of his suspension.  ""For several weeks I was subjected to relentless criticism on social media and in conservative news outlets regarding my role as moderator for the second presidential debate including attacks aimed directly at my family"" Scully wrote. ""This culminated on Thursday October 8th when I heard President Trump go on national television twice and falsely attack me by name. Out of frustration I sent a brief tweet addressed to Anthony Scaramucci. The next morning when I saw that this tweet had created a controversy I falsely claimed that my Twitter account had been hacked.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP C-SPAN also issued a statement revealing that the network and the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) were made aware about Scully's fabrication on Wednesday.  ""We are very saddened by this news and do not condone his actions"" C-SPAN said. ""Starting immediately we have placed Steve on administrative leave. After some distance from this episode we believe in his ability to continue to contribute to C-SPAN.""  Fox News’ Joseph A. Wulfsohn contributed to this report.    ", https://www.foxnews.com/media/steve-scully-joy-reid-hacked,0.8103169490323768
133,Hacked? Steve Scully held to higher standard than MSNBC’s Joy Reid because C-SPAN has ethics critics say," Oct. 12 2020 – This is a rush transcript from “The Ingraham Angle” October 12 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM FOX NEWS HOST: We'll see you tomorrow. All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. He's back. Yes Donald Trump on the trail tonight electrifying voters in Sanford Florida. Victor Davis Hanson explains the significance of the president's reemergence just three weeks to Sean said until election night.  And did you see the ad that went viral over the weekend. Joe Collins does a Kim Klacik and is the star of it as he looks to unseat Mad Maxine Waters.  After her nearly five-decade representation if that's what you want to call it in LA. He's here exclusively tonight. He is awesome you're going to love him.  Plus Raymond Arroyo brings us what has been a very trying 48 hours for the Biden-Harris ticket. Things you have not seen anywhere else tonight unpacked in Seen and Unseen. But first big days for Columbus and Trump.  Trump's big return. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.  We have only a few more hours left in Columbus Day and we have as we said only three weeks until Election Day. And right now both Christopher Columbus and President Trump are under siege. They're vilified. They're subjects of an ongoing smear campaign constant distortions lies and hateful propaganda.  Now in Portland Oregon over the weekend angry Leftists are there any other kind of Leftist by the way. We can get rid of angry just Leftists ripped down Teddy Roosevelt and Lincoln statues while protesting Christopher Columbus over the weekend throw them all into the pot.  Now the scene looks like something out of Baghdad circa 2003. And I guess we're supposed to be what impressed with the way they use ropes and spray paint to desecrate statues built by people with real talent and skill. Now it's mostly white ANTIFA and other BLM marauding brats behind all this chaos and they called their events their day of rage. Again what other days do they have.  Now Trump wants to make sure that these miscreants spend their next one behind bars.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We've also directed the FBI to immediately investigate the destruction of the Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln statues in Portland and to prosecute the offenders to the fullest extent of federal law.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Of course these spoiled nihilists don't really care about the target of their rage. Christopher Columbus. How many of you think they really know anything about Columbus beyond what they're told in I don't know? Facebook Instagram. You know they don't know what the old and the new worlds were like in the 15th century and most of them don't even know again anything beyond what they read on some angry Marxist online post.  Now we all know this story.   I mean if you do if you remember anything that you learned in school when you used to learn stuff like this that Columbus never step foot on what is now American soil instead he landed elsewhere in the Caribbean which he thought was the East Indies.  But Columbus' discoveries they set off a chain of events that eventually led to our own founding. His contributions to the development of freedom in America they're evident everywhere.  Now remember our capital is the District of Columbia. From Columbus. But then the dark cloud of political correctness descended as captured so well in a piece that was written by the Wall Street Journal a writer there a few years ago.  Today Columbus's reputation is under siege but those seeking to delegitimize the genuine explorer's legacy might actually have a larger target in mind. Statues of Columbus and tributes to his achievements are in many ways proxies for the Western tradition of freedom liberty and the rule of law. America had better protect Columbus and win this war. There is no one else to save the world next time around. Hear! Hear!  Now for decades Columbus stood not just as a historical icon but as a tribute to the contributions of Italian Americans to the building of our nation incredible craftsmen incredible scientists. I mean just to honor them. Not that Nancy Pelosi cared. Of course she refused to stand against the radicals when they came for Columbus in her own hometown of Baltimore just months ago.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I don't care that much about statues.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Should that be done by a commission or the city council not a mob in the middle of the night throwing it into the harbor.  PELOSI: People would do what they do.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: They'll do what they do until they come for the statue of Nancy or her hairdresser. Now when they knocked down statues they spray paint federal courthouses set fire to police stations punch a kid in the face for the crime of wearing a MAGA hat. You've seen those videos.   They're saying that they hate a lot more than just Donald Trump. They hate pretty much everything about America that arrive before the latest iPhone update. Now seriously the peaceful protests were never really about George Floyd or police brutality or transgender rights or climate change or any of the issues.   This at base at the bottom of all this. This is about power and about money taking it from you and giving it to the elites. Now to get you to give up your money and your freedom they need to lie and they need to lie a lot. But we cannot let those lies stand. I was thinking about this a lot this weekend and I talked to a lot of folks outside the Washington orbit which is always a pleasure and I am so tired of hearing that America is systemically racist sexist xenophobic. All of them are lies.  Of course they're bad people and evil people in every society. But we are a wonderful country. We are home to millions upon millions upon millions of generous and kind and patriotic giving citizens. And you may not like his tone and you may not like his tweets but the president he wants all Americans to be safe prosperous and free regardless of skin color regardless of ethnicity and his economic policies they tell that story.  You know why? Because they've benefited the most in need of help the poor and the working class those numbers are irrefutable. I wish Trump would talk about it more. And I'm tired of hearing that our history is so awful that we should destroy all representations of it. Because taking down monuments and destroying history is what the Soviets did it's what Mao did. It's what ISIS did. It's what the Taliban did. We are people who are supposed to learn from history teach real history not the 1619 nonsense.  We're not the people who destroy our history or hide it. We learn from it.  You know what else I'm tired of? I'm tired of the Democrats most sickening lies about COVID including that the president is responsible for deaths caused by a Chinese virus. It's putrid and that's a lie. President Trump has handled this better than any leader in the G7. And our booming economy and falling hospitalization rates tell that story. It is a virus. And if you talk to scientists who aren't lying about things because of politics they have a saying you know what it is? A virus is gone a virus. It's a virus.  From now until November 3rd you will witness the biggest propaganda effort in our lifetime the Democrats they are flushed with cash from Wall Street and big tech and they're overwhelming Republicans coast-to-coast with fear lies deceit and yes a lot of it in kind contributions from biased reporters and social media censors.  But the angle for the next 21 days until I'm on the air is going to tell you the truth to the last minute of the last day. We'll tell you the real truth about COVID about the economy and about our national security.  If Joe Biden a man who's obviously not in-charge wins on Election Day.  Our world a world in the United States and frankly around the world it's going to change but not for the better. China will become stronger and our economy will become weaker. Most Americans will become poorer and less free.  And across the globe those lockdowns have become government's weapon of choice against COVID many think a test run for something far more nefarious the damage done by those experts that Biden relies on so heavily right now for all of his expertise and advice it's so devastating that even the W.H.O. can't hide the truth anymore.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as a primary means of control of this virus. We may well have at least a doubling of child malnutrition because children are not getting meals at school. This is a terrible ghastly global catastrophe. Lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never ever belittle and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Now some of us have been saying that since last April. Well someone tell that by the way to Governor Cuomo who on this Columbus Day has not ruled out further lockdowns.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you preparing for the possibility of another shutdown?   ANDREW CUOMO NEW YORK GOVERNOR: I don't believe it's inevitable. I believe it's possible. Look we're closing down areas that are about one or two square miles. Right. You can target that way and close down small areas.  Then it's not inevitable that the spread gets so large that you would have to close down an entire city or state. We have to use the science.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Is that what he's calling it? Meanwhile the president forges on.  Behind in the polls but not in energy and enthusiasm for those of us who came of age in the 1980s. My friends this is our challenge. Because none of us were called to fight in World War II or live through the Great Depression but now we're called to stand for our freedom because we know and I think the president knows that if freedom falls here it's going to fail everywhere. So don't be afraid.  It may seem like all hope is lost that everything you love and cherish is under threat but you are not alone. There are millions and millions of people just like you out there tonight. And you don't want handouts you don't want government checks you want the freedom to make your own way and you want a government that looks out for you and your family. The president had thousands of people lined up tonight in Florida just 10 days after being hospitalized for COVID and he's back in fighting form.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I went through it now they say I'm immune I feel so powerful. When you're the president you can't lock yourself in a basement and say I'm not going to bother with the world. You've got to get out. And it's risky.  It's risky but you've got to get out.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: But will America choose to go with the spent candidate who epitomizes the swamp? This was a scene in Arizona over the weekend at a big Biden-Harris event.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not a lot of fanfare out here there's really not much to see. I'll step out of the way but it's kind of boring out here. So it's not your typical presidential campaign event. We don't see people rallying outside. We don't see signs or really much of what's going on.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Well he has been warning everyone to socially distance maybe not that far. Happy Columbus Day and that's THE ANGLE.  Joining me now is Victor Davis Hanson Hoover Institution Senior Fellow.  Victor Trump's officially back. Are we going to see a 2016 repeat where he just outworked Hillary down the stretch? Or is the Left kind of trying to cover all of its bases this time because they don't want to get burned again?   VICTOR DAVIS HANSON HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW: No I think it's going to be like 2016 or maybe 1980 when Reagan came back. Remember Reagan was down in early October. The reason is Laura a couple of reasons that this lockdown was never symmetrical. There were arguments for it to flatten the so-called curve. So we didn't get overwhelmed. But it was never a static situation. It was a bad choice versus the worse of a pandemic. But it changes.  And after nine months almost the damage that we're doing economically health wise to the country is overwhelming and it's overwhelming the risk even of the virus. And more importantly it was asymmetrical on who benefited and who didn't or who got hurt I should say. All these people who drive trucks and stock shelves and they're in the drugstore waiting on you are there growing food out here where I am in the rural California they risk this every single day. They're not the Zoom or Skype class. And they had trouble enough going to the doctor when they were working 40 hours a week.   But when they go to an urgent care and shut down or they don't have a concierge doctor and yet to be criticized by this professional class that's in their basement of which fairly or not Joe Biden is the epitome of that. And that's why we have campaigns. That's a preview of how people will stand up under the rigors of the job. Whether it's fair or not you cannot run the presidency the way he's running his campaign from the basement. It just won't work. He's got to get out. He's got to meet the people. He's got to take some risks like Donald Trump did.  He's got to be from 6 in the morning till 7 or 9 like a president. He's got to be fully engaged. And people have to see that the last three weeks and they haven't seen it. And Trump is making the argument that he's won with the middle muscular classes that he takes the same risks as they do when he gets sick. He's willing to take experimental drugs even if they have dangerous interactions. We don't know much about it but the point is he's got to get back out Trump said and be with the people because they're the ones sacrificing for our collective help. If it wasn't for these guys that are growing food and delivering it and producing energy we couldn't be in our basements. And Biden's got to appreciate that fact.   INGRAHAM: Well he's played the basement campaign and he sees himself up in a lot of these polls. So I think so far he thinks it's working for him.  But Dr. Fauci was very upset at the Trump campaign Victor for putting him in an ad. Now listen to what he said today.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Prosperity will surge normal.  DR. ANTHONY FAUCI WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE: That's really unfortunate and really disappointing that they did that it's so clear that I'm not a political person.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What would you say if I told you I heard that the Trump campaign was actually preparing to do another ad featuring you?   FAUCI: That would be terrible. I mean that would be outrageous if they do that. In fact that might actually come back to backfire on them. I hope they don't do that.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Victor the Left has been using Fauci for their political benefit all year no complaint from Fauci through any of that. So I think that reaction is quite rich.   HANSON: Yes it is. There were times and we still were there when everybody says we're doing terribly if you look at the deaths per million and compare them to the major European countries we're not doing that badly.  We're better than Spain. We're about where France - little bit not as well as France now but where the UK is we don't know what in the world is going on in China or Russia or India but we know that they're accurate.  Their statistics are not accurate.  We know that 11 percent of the population in just four states Connecticut Massachusetts New Jersey New York account for over 30 percent of the fatalities for decisions that are made were in retrospect really unwise.  And yet Fauci never really said that. He would weigh in and editorialize.  I'm not happy with this. I'm happy with this. Wear mask don't wear mask. Go on a cruise. Don't go on a cruise. Social distance. But if I go to a game I don't.  And so when he said I think the turning point Laura was when he said well I did say you don't have to wear a mask. And that was because I was afraid that people would-- INGRAHAM: Yes flip-flop.  HANSON: If I said to wear them they'd go out and overwhelm supply. In other words he thought he was saying a platonic noble lie I'm going to nobly lie to you about mask so for the greater good. But once you do that you lose all credibility. And he has no credibility. It's sad because he was a renowned figure but no one believes him anymore.   INGRAHAM: Well the idea that he's not supporting Biden is just I mean does anyone believe that? I mean I'm sorry. Like it's just come on. He says it's not political OK but he pretty much obvious what's going on here. Victor thank you so much. Wonderful to see you tonight. And as I mentioned in THE ANGLE the W.H.O. has done an about face on lockdowns finally admitting they're worse than the disease itself.  Remember what Trump said back in April or March the cure can't be worse than the disease itself. He said that and he was trashed by the media. But the president responded to the news this way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: The World Health Organization did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago and they admitted that Donald Trump was right.  The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat run states with a lockdown sealed up suicide rates drug rates alcoholism deaths by so many different forms. You can't do that. And we've got to remember I said it right at the beginning the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Joining me now Dr. Ramin Oskoui Cardiologist CEO of Foxhall Cardiology in Washington. Dr. Oskoui the scientific consensus is now on Trump's side. Where are the mea culpas from the people who are trashing you me the president and all of us who early on said got to get this country open.   DR. RAMIN OSKOUI CARDIOLOGIST: Well I think there's one abiding characteristic of all politicians. They can never say they're sorry they can never admit a mistake. And that's where we need to see the W.H.O. Dr.  Fauci Dr. Gottlieb all these people who really have shown us by their poor prognostic ability that they don't have any clothes they're the proverbial emperor without any clothes.   INGRAHAM: And Dr. Oskoui the warning signs and the red flags of warning are being raised every day by Dr. Fauci and friends on all of the other cables all day long. It's going to be the worst winter ever. Flu coming inside. You say that there are two over-the-counter supplements that would do enormous benefit to people across the country with minimal to no side effects for most people what are those two things that most everyone should be taking?   OSKOUI: It's what I tell all my patients and have since March. There are two studies one out of the United States one out of Israel that show benefit to higher dose vitamin D getting your vitamin D level over 50 can markedly reduce by about 50 percent. Your risk of COVID. Vitamin D is notoriously well tolerated with almost no side effects. So I typically tell my patients to take anywhere from two to 5000 IU of vitamin D3 a day.  The Israeli study was interesting but it showed benefit using drops of vitamin D as opposed to tablets. The second is zinc typical side effect for some very few people as GI upset? But 50 milligrams of chelated zinc also over the counter easy available has also been shown to be a factor.  INGRAHAM: So D3 and zinc and finally we're almost out of time. But we don't have to play the sound bite. But Dr. Fauci is already upset about Trump holding rallies. It's very dangerous. 15 seconds on that.   OSKOUI: Well where was Dr. Fauci when the Walgreens pharmacy near his house in northwest Washington was looted? He seems to be against religious gatherings and he seems to be against Republican campaign rallies but other than that he's silent.   INGRAHAM: Yes you don't hear much not much about the riots. Maybe the rioters just. Well they were masked because then they don't get the photos to the police. Just a bunch of weird masks. Dr. Oskoui wonderful to see you. I've got to take my zinc and D3 chelated zinc.  Coming up the Democrats lines of attack against Amy Coney Barrett during today's hearing reveal a very inconvenient truth. They got nothing. I'll explain it in moments.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D-RI): The big secretive influences behind this unseemly rush to see this nominee as a judicial torpedo.  SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): You've been nominated by a president who shows contempt for the Constitution but does not hesitate to tell his loyal followers that you are being sent to the bench to do his political chores.  SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: By replacing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with someone who will undo her legacy. President Trump is attempting to roll back Americans rights.  SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): Lives are what's at stake with this nomination.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Well Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing today thankfully wasn't a repeat of the Kavanaugh ordeal two years ago. Dems still spent the day spewing vicious smears about Trump's pick to replace Justice Ginsburg.  Now joining me now are two special people. They both clerked for my old boss Justice Clarence Thomas Attorney Robert Dunn and John Eastman Claremont Institute Senior Fellow.  John let's start with you. They obviously didn't lay a glove on her but the hyperbole on display from the Left especially Dick Durbin harkening back to the old days when there were unanimous confirmation votes for Scalia and near unanimous for RBG. And in just bemoaning the fact that things have changed as if he wasn't part of it.  JOHN EASTMAN CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR: As if he wasn't a major part of it.  Look this is what happens when the Democrats try and make the Supreme Court into their super legislature to accomplish things that can't get through the legislature or win at the ballot box. But what Trump has done with this appointment and or nomination and the two prior ones is to try and get the court back to actually faithfully applying the law and the Constitution.   INGRAHAM: Oh Robert Senator Blumenthal today said that Judge Barrett should not be involved in certain cases in other words she should recuse herself. Watch.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Your participation let me be very blunt in any case involving Donald Trump's election would immediately do explosive enduring harm to the court's legitimacy and to your own credibility you must recuse yourself.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Now Robert how does this overly politicized process hurt the court's legitimacy? What's going on here?   ROBERT DUNN CLERKED FOR JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS: It obviously does not.  That is a veiled threat from Senator Blumenthal. It's nothing more. She has no obligation to recuse herself from any case just because the president appointed her. And that case obviously Kavanaugh and Gorsuch would have to recuse themselves as well because they too were appointed by or nominated by President Trump.  She's not going to do that. And there is no mechanism to force her to do that. And to be frank that is really dangerous rhetoric by Senator Blumenthal because he along with his Democratic colleagues are essentially trying to delegitimize her and the court before she gets there so that they can tee up some sort of protest the first time she issues a ruling they don't like. It's quite dangerous.  INGRAHAM: Now John we keep talking about court packing and maybe the folks out there don't know what that is but the Democrats are playing a little game about what it all really means. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRISTOPHER COONS (D-DE):  It's rushed it constitutes court packing and her views are too extreme to qualify her to serve on this court.  SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL):  It's a common question being asked because the American people have watched the Republicans packing the court over the last three-and-a-half years and they brag about it. They've taken every vacancy and filled it.  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  The only court packing going on right now is going on with the Republicans packing the court now. It's not constitutional what they're doing.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  And how many times did he touch his mask John in that little clip? Will that attempt it's a rather pathetic attempt at reframing it work any better than blaming President Trump for the lockdowns which is what they're also trying to do?  JOHN EASTMAN CLAREMONT INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW:  Well when he said it's unconstitutional that's just preposterous. There are 29 times in our history a vacancy has occurred in the last year of a president's term of office. In 28 out of those 29 times the president nominated somebody including Barack Obama who nominated Merrick Garland. And in most of those times when the Senate was in the same party hands as the White House the Senate confirmed them.  The only time that that didn't happen was in 1864 and here was a big lie from Senator Kamala Harris at the debate last week when she said Abraham Lincoln said we should let the people decide. He said no such thing. Roger Taney the despicable Roger Taney who wrote the Dred Scott decision died in office a couple weeks before the election. The Senate was out of session. The president couldn't have sent a nomination up there if he wanted to. And the day they got back into session he sent a nomination up.  So this is what the Constitution allows. The notion that they're packing the court by filling vacancies by the methods the Constitution sets out is preposterous.  INGRAHAM:  It's ridiculous.  We've got to go to Robert on this one because Kamala Harris had to leave the trail temporarily to have a little makeshift office on a Skype Robert kind of like yours. What is that in the background? And she talked about how the process is just illegitimate. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  More than 9 million Americans have already voted and millions more will vote while this illegitimate committee process is underway. A clear majority of Americans want whomever wins this election to fill this seat and my Republican colleagues know that. Yet they are deliberately defying the will of the people.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  Robert illegitimate process take it away.  DUNN:  The Constitution gives the president the right to nominate it gives the Senate the right and the responsibility to advise and consent. They are following that.  They had a choice. They obviously could have waiting if they thought there was advantage to that. They decided not to because they believe that there need to be nine justices on the court as quickly as possible. There is literally nothing unconstitutional about it. The Constitution does not say in a presidential election the rules are different. It is a perfectly legitimate process. They don't like it but that's a political calculation on their part.  INGRAHAM:  She was no less persuasive in that comment and she was at the debate. Gentlemen great to have you both on tonight. Thanks so much. Great first appearance by Robert.  Coming up Joe Biden's latest embarrassing memory slip the question what does the man remember? Raymond Arroyo is here will all that seen and unseen next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM:  It's time for our ""Seen and Unseen"" where we reveal the stories behind the headlines. Joining us now with all the details Raymond Arroyo FOX News contributor author of the forthcoming ""The Spider Who Saved Christmas."" Ray the Barrett hearings went pretty smoothly today unless what?  RAYMOND ARROYO FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well unless your name is Kamala Harris I guess. Bear in mind Senator Harris's office Laura is in the Hart Senatorial Building OK. She's on the first floor. This judicial hearing was on the second floor. But nonetheless out of fears of catching COVID Senator Harris decided to drop into the hearings virtually kind of.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Senator Harris?  SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Can you hear me?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes hello?  HARRIS:  Hello?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We hear you.  HARRIS:  Mr. Chairman this hearing --   (INAUDIBLE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Senator? HARRIS:  Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just wait just one second. We don't see you.  HARRIS:  Of course. You don't see me. Can you see me now?  (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO:  When they finally got the connection fixed and they could hear her it proved that well Senator Harris has been spending a lot of time with Joe Biden. Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This committee has ignored common sense requests to keep people safe including not requiring testing for all members despite a coronavirus outbreak among senators of this very committee. The decision to hold this hearing now is reckless and places facilities workers janitorial staff and congressional aides and capitol police at risk.  (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO:  Laura it's like -- I guess she wants to delay the election. Look the office of the architect -- the office of the attending physician at the capitol they laid everything out in that hearing room so everybody could be socially distance masks keeping everybody safe. Now Kamala Harris wants a new federal program so she could be in a hearing room with a few senators. I don't understand this at all and I think she strains this COVID argument a bit.  INGRAHAM:  Really? It's not that they want to sell fear because -- I think Raymond she knows her co -- she has a co-running mate status. She's not the only running mate with Biden. She's running with COVID. So she has to keep COVID right next to her in that -- there's an invisible seat right next to her and it's COVID it's the thing with the big red receptors coming off of it. So she has to keep that front and center.  Now Raymond you are in Columbus Ohio for Columbus Day with Vice President Pence. What happened?  ARROYO:  I was indeed. Joe Biden was there as well in Ohio Laura. The vice president he spoke at this construction company. About 1000 people were there and they were lining the streets. Bear in mind this is a Monday.  It's a holiday and yet there were people all over the streets to greet the vice president. Joe Biden on the other hand held an event in Toledo with a handful of people and he may be running for another office Laura.  Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  You know we have to come together.  That's why I'm running. I'm running as a proud Democrat for the Senate.  If we just raise the tax back to what it should be 28 percent that generates over $100 billion. Do you hear me? That's money -- excuse me $1.3 trillion. That's what raises.  So vote! Vote!

(END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO:  OK so we've decided to go to that website Laura. Like so many things on this campaign trail it was not found. Can you believe this?  (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM:  Maybe he's just missing being -- he's thinking of the confirmation battle that he's been involved with for the Supreme Court over and over again and he was channeling himself back to that hearing for all of the old nominees maybe. So he said Senate I'm running for Senate Raymond. Raymond Biden also -- ARROYO:  I don't know what's going on but there's a lot of missed words and facts are slipping. It's a mess. INGRAHAM:  He also couldn't find the name of the man that he ran against in 2012. The password is Mitt Romney.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  You may remember I got in trouble running against the senator who is a Mormon the governor OK. And I took him on. No one's faith should be questioned.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  The Mormon guy.   ARROYO:  I'm so glad to be on that blond woman's show the Catholic one with the earrings dropping. What's her -- You know the one.  (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM:  The guy from the Follies think from New Orleans with the --   ARROYO:  There you go. (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM:  Oh my gosh.  ARROYO:  On Friday Biden traveled to Nevada and Arizona Laura and he issued a call for a new minimum wage even if you drop the price really fast.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  A $15 million -- a $15000 -- $15 minimum wage. I'm dreaming here. But a $15 minimum wage for our essential workers. We're not just going to praise you. We're going to pay you.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  Well it was like ready to go down to 15 cent or 1.5 cents Raymond.  ARROYO:  Yes it was dropping fast Laura. By the way our embedded reporter told us about 12 people attended that event outside 12.  INGRAHAM:  And don't forget Raymond's new show on FOX Nation ""Amy Coney Barrett The Early Years"" where he talks Barrett's friends and family in her hometown of New Orleans. So make sure to check that out on FOX Nation.  Also coming out a GOP congressional candidate has gone viral for his takedown of Congresswoman Maxine Waters. This is great. Joe Collins joins us exclusively next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM:  After decades in the swamp my next guest says it's time to send Congresswoman Maxine Waters packing -- her packing not him. And his new viral campaign ad just might help them get the job done.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE E. COLLINS III (R) RUNNING AGAINST REP. MAXINE WATERS:  Do know where I am right now? Maxine Waters' $6 million mansion. Do you know where I'm not right now? Maxine Waters' district. Yes that's right. Maxine does not live in our district. But I do. I was born right here in south L.A. in a place Maxine refuses to live.  Maxine Waters does not drink our water she does not breathe our air and while she sits here in her mansion our district is in ruins. Daily crime spiked 15 percent in south L.A. The homeless rate in south L.A. has shot by 53 percent. South L.A. has the highest poverty rate in the city with a crippling 42 percent of its residents living below the poverty line.  Homelessness rates have increased by 264 percent since 2009. And our schools fail our children.  Unlike Maxine Waters I know the pain that crime violence gangs homelessness does to our children. I was one of the kids left behind by Maxine Waters. I'm going to fight for safety and dignity for south L.A. The only question you need to ask is this -- in the last 44 years where has Maxine Waters been?  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  And joining me now the candidate behind that ad Joe Collins Navy vet and candidate for California's 43rd Congressional District. Joe I know you're at the Trump rally tonight but that video racked up 3 million views more than that in less than 48 hours. So what's the response been?  Are you raising money from that? And what about the people in the actual district that you want to represent what have you heard?  JOE E. COLLINS III (R) RUNNING AGAINST REP. MAXINE WATERS:  Yes so the video was actually an anomaly. We have a really good team effort that video together so shouts out to everybody on team Collins. But we've always been doing good at fundraising because the message that we've been bringing to the people is the message of rebuilding the community bringing quality jobs back supporting small businesses and overhauling our education as well as rebuilding the relationship within the police and the community.  And so these are things that people actually want to have. Maxine she's been in office for a very long time and if you live in south L.A. you know the conditions of the district and it's absolutely not normal. The people are ready for a change.  INGRAHAM:  Joe the ad mentioned this but crime in Los Angeles homicides up 15 percent this year but Congressman Waters she says the police of the problem and she tweeted this back in June. She said ""Police reform is not enough. Getting rid of serial racist ignorant and stupid cops must be a priority."" I'm sure the cops appreciated that. Joe how much worse will life become for residents in your district if this perpetual Democrat machine the stranglehold on power that they have persists?  COLLINS:  It's going to get real bad. We can see from homelessness already it's bad. It's been skyrocketing since 2009. End Maxine she's a legislator. She has the power to create or remove legislation that affects positive change and brings value to our lives and she has failed to do that for the amount of time that she spent in Congress as well as the state Senate and the state assembly. So if we do not remove her from office if we don't start electing new people into office we are going to continue to see a downslide in our communities economic decline in our communities and violence is going to get worse.  INGRAHAM:  And Joe she took a direct shot at you Maxine did last month saying he's a Trump puppet he's a big supporter of Trump and he loves Trump and he's acting just like Trump because all the lies that he tells all the time. Joe I'm looking at you I don't see any strings there. I see no strings on you. I know you're in your car too which is hilarious. No strings there. So your response to dear old Maxine?  COLLINS:  You know what Maxine Waters has never had to campaign against somebody in a very long time. And she can't talk about herself because nobody would listen. She can't talk about her record because she has no record. And so the only thing that she can say to try and dissuade voters is he's a Trump puppet. Mind you I've never met the president before so that's pretty odd.  But I'll tell you this President Trump has done an incredible job creating policies that we can use in our inner cities to build our inner cities but he's done a great job with our economy. I prefer to be a Trump puppet than someone who supports Maxine Waters or be Maxine Waters any day. She can say what she wants but at the end of the day I fought for this country so she can have the right to talk trash about me which is perfectly fine. This is America.  INGRAHAM:  Joe I wish you the best of luck. I hope you talk to as many people as possible educate the folks on the ground -- they need it all across the country -- on what freedom really means and what is coming up we don't change -- we don't change the Democrat stranglehold on that entire state of California. Joe thanks so much.  Coming up Trump explains what's at stake in three weeks.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You vote for me prosperity will surge. Normal life that's all we want. We want a normal life. Biden would terminate our recovery delay the vaccine prolong the pandemic and annihilate Florida's economy with a draconian unscientific lockdown. That's what he wants to do lock it down. (BOOS) TRUMP:  Lock it down everybody.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: It was good to see the president back on the trail. He's going to be very busy over the next 21 days and making clear what's at stake for Floridians and all Americans in November. It's all the time we have tonight.

134,Democrats smear Amy Coney Barrett during confirmation hearing," Evidence is beginning to show that intense indoor sports can contribute to COVID-19 transmission per a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which cited an ice hockey game resulting in 14 infected individuals. The index patient or believed source of infection had a fever cough sore throat and headache a day after playing in the June 16 game in Tampa Bay Fla. per the study. Two days later a nasal swab confirmed the infection and shortly thereafter 13 other players and a staff member at the ice rink came down with symptoms as well. Of the 15 total cases 11 infections were confirmed via PCR testing and two had positive antigen tests while two were not tested. “The ice rink provides a venue that is likely well suited to COVID-19 transmission as an indoor environment where deep breathing occurs and persons are in close proximity to one another” per the study. 4 CORONAVIRUS TREATMENTS INCLUDING REMDESIVIR HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE FLOP IN LARGE WHO STUDY More infections cropped up on the index patient's team which the CDC said may have been from more exposure in their separate locker room and sitting closely together on the bench. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The players flouted cloth face masks in the locker room and during the game but wore hockey-related protective face gear like plastic half-shields and metal cages while still others wore no protective face gear the health agency wrote. The two on-ice referees managed to escape symptoms. The CDC also took the plexiglass surrounding the rink into consideration which created a “physically segregated playing area.” A sole spectator also managed to escape symptoms but was not tested. ""The high proportion of infections that occurred in this outbreak provides evidence for SARS-CoV-2 transmission during an indoor sporting activity where intense physical activity is occurring"" the agency wrote. Staff at the Florida Department of Health followed up with isolation and quarantine guidance to those involved among other steps taken.

135,Intense indoor sports raise coronavirus risk CDC warns citing 14 infected at ice hockey game," The convergence of law and politics is a common occurrence in Washington. While law is used to ascertain truth politics is often used to obscure it. That is why the truth is rarely evident in looking at a scandal straight on. Rather it requires peripheral vision or analysis – often what is not evident is what is most enlightening. This most famous example of such reasoning was found in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s story “Silver Blaze” on Sherlock Holmes’s investigation of the disappearance of a racehorse. The local inspector asked if there was “any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?” ADRIANA COHEN: FACEBOOK TWITTER'S THUGGISH CENSORSHIP AND ELECTION INTERFERENCE MEAN NO CITIZEN IS SAFE Holmes responds “To the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime.” When the inspector objects “The dog did nothing in the night-time” Holmes replies “That was the curious incident.” There is always something a tad curious of Washington legal scandals in what has not occurred. That is why the latest Hunter Biden scandal is so curious.  When the story broke in the New York Post the Biden campaign was faced with thousands of emails that purportedly showed clear support for allegations that Hunter Biden was given millions as part of an influence-peddling scheme related to his father then-Vice President Joe Biden. There was ample reason to be skeptical about the sketchy account of a computer being left by Hunter Biden at a computer store with a man who cannot see beyond a couple of feet.  And then there is the timing of disclosure just weeks before an election. The problem was the absence of ""barks"" from the Biden camp. The computer files revealed a host of embarrassing pictures of Hunter Biden using drugs or exposed in other embarrassing ways. The emails contain dates and addresses that match up with confirmed records. If they are fabricated there were three barks that we would have expected within hours of the release. Bark 1: This was not Hunter Biden’s computer The most obvious response would be that this is not the computer of Hunter Biden.  After all the computer store owner John Paul Mac Isaac who is legally blind said that he could not recognize the person who dropped off the laptop. However Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has now stated as a fact that “the laptop was left by Hunter Biden in an inebriated heavily inebriated state with the merchant.”  That does not purport with what Isaac said.  However there remains the question of a laptop with a “Beau Biden Foundation” sticker on it with highly incriminating files.  Someone in the campaign must have called Hunter Biden and he had to have told them whether or not it was his laptop.  The response on ownership has been crickets for days. Bark 2: These were not Hunter Biden’s photos or emails Even if the campaign cannot deny that the computer was Hunter Biden’s it could deny that these incriminating pictures and emails were his.  Again crickets.  Note that if these are fabricated emails or pictures this would be a serious federal crime and the basis for legal action. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS OPINION NEWSLETTER The Biden camp has no shortage of lawyers. Indeed they have been signing up lawyers in droves in preparation for election challenges.  Yet there is not a single allegation of fraud or fabrication after days of a brewing scandal. Bark 3: This is defamation Perhaps this bark is the most telling. If these emails or pictures are fabricated it is a clear case of defamation and other tort actions.  It would seem that one of the hundreds of lawyers currently lined up by the Biden campaign would fire off an ""intent to sue"" letter.  Truth is a defense to defamation so the letter might start with the earlier bark and deny that this was Hunter Biden’s computer and these were Hunter Biden’s file. One big difference between the legal and political worlds is that in the latter there is no protection for the right to remain silent. In politics scandals can be managed but not silently. Instead of these obvious barks the public heard something closer to a whimper: that the campaign could not find any notation on Vice President Biden's official schedule that he met with a Ukrainian figure connected to the payments to his son Hunter Biden. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It would be a curious sight in itself for Biden’s official schedule to include “meeting with Ukrainian connected to Hunter.” Many meetings are not part of an official schedule that staffers know is subject to official records laws for preservation and review. That is what is so curious about the Hunter Biden story and to move from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to Lewis Carroll it is becoming “curiouser and curiouser.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEY ", https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/hunter-biden-computer-facebook-trump-censorship-scandal-jonathan-turley,0.8103328651226125
136,Jonathan Turley: Hunter Biden's laptop and the Facebook Twitter censorship scandal – watch these 3 things, EXCLUSIVE: The Justice Department on Friday said that 94% of confirmed illegal immigrants incarcerated in Federal Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Marshals Service facilities were nabbed while unlawfully present in the United States Fox News has learned. The data comes as part of the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security’s Alien Incarceration Report for Fiscal Year 2019 which was exclusively obtained by Fox News on Friday. According to the report at the end of FY2019 a total of 51074 known or suspected aliens were in DOJ custody with 27494 in BOP facilities and 23580 in USMS facilities. Some 70% of those known illegal immigrants in BOP custody had been convicted of a non-immigration-related offense while 39% of illegal immigrants in USMS facilities had been convicted of a non-immigration-related offense. NINTH CIRCUIT RULES TRUMP CAN'T DIVERT MILITARY FUNDS FOR BORDER WALL The report also notes that 969 individuals or 3.6% had committed offenses including kidnapping murder larceny terrorism escape bribery and extortion and rape. More than half of the known or suspected illegal immigrants had U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) orders of removal or who had agreed to depart voluntarily while 35.8% were still under investigation by ICE and 7.2% were illegal aliens under adjudication. The report noted that 1.8% were legal aliens who were under adjudication and 1.7% were aliens who had been granted relief or protection from removal. According to the report by the end of the fiscal year USMS had “directly expended $162 million to house the 23580 known or suspected aliens remanded to their custody in state local  and private facilities.” The average cost to house noncitizen in the facilities according to the Justice Department is $88.19 per prisoner per day. “The Departments continues to progress towards establishing data collection of the immigration status of convicted aliens incarcerated in state prisons and local detention centers through the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Immigration statistics” the report said. The report detailed a number of cases the Justice Department had been reviewing. For example during the first quarter of 2019 in the Southern District of Florida a Colombian national was sentenced to 180 months in prison for his role in a scheme to smuggle illegal aliens from Colombia into the United States which resulted in the rape of one and the death of two Cuban nationals. Another case in the District of South Carolina was about a Mexican citizen sentenced to 262 months in federal prison for conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine. During the second quarter of 2019 the Justice Department said in the Northern District of Iowa a citizen of Guatemala illegally present in the U.S. was sentenced to six months in custody after a bench trial found him guilty of three counts of unlawful use of an identification document and four counts of misuse of a Social Security Number. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And in the Western District of Louisiana a citizen of Mexico was sentenced to 21 years in prison for distributing LSD in St. Mary Parish and possessing firearms. The report came out after President Trump in 2017 issued an executive order on “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States” directing “the Secretary [of Homeland Security] and the Attorney General…to collect relevant data and provide quarterly reports” on the immigration status of all aliens incarcerated under the supervision of BOP and USMS and the immigration status of all convicted aliens incarcerated in State prisons and local detention centers throughout the United States. , https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-dhs-release-alien-incarceration-report-say-94-of-illegal-aliens-in-custody-were-unlawfully-present,0.8102654288548714
137,DOJ DHS release 'Alien Incarceration' report say 94% of illegal aliens in custody were 'unlawfully present', As lawmakers on Capitol Hill squabble over the terms of an additional coronavirus relief package new research shows that there are more Americans claiming unemployment benefits than are actually unemployed. That scenario is highly unlikely researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis wrote in a blog post this week but has become possible because of new measures that loosened requirements to collect benefits implemented as part of the CARES Act. “The specifics of the CARES Act allow people to receive benefits so that they do not have to report to work if their health conditions make it too dangerous” researchers wrote in a blog post. “In such cases the beneficiary is not technically unemployed as there is no active job search going on. But benefits are still received through the unemployment insurance program of the person’s respective state.” According to data from the St. Louis Fed as of September about 12.5 million people were unemployed while around 13.5 million were making claims. A chart shows this has largely been the case since April. RISING JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR WHITE WORKING-CLASS MEN COULD POINT TO ADDITIONAL TRUMP SUPPORT  The CARES Act provided for an additional $600 per person in unemployment benefits – on top of what is typically provided by individual states – to help individuals weather the financial effects of the coronavirus pandemic. That policy expired in July. Republicans were not keen to renew the measure because they claimed it eliminated an incentive for individuals to seek out new employment opportunities since in some cases unemployment benefits were higher than what a person would otherwise earn. Many states have also run through a $300 weekly unemployment payment authorized by the Trump administration in August. There are ongoing conversations between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. on the terms of another potential stimulus package. However so far both sides have been unable to reach an agreement on certain items including funding for state and local governments.

138,More people receiving unemployment benefits than are unemployed research finds," A Michigan judge ruled on Friday that prosecutors could move to trial with five men accused of plotting to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. U.S. Magistrate Judge Sally Berens ruled the five men’s cases can proceed to a grand jury to determine whether any or all would be indicted. Indictments would be required for the men to face trial. A hearing this week featured testimony by one of the FBI agents who ran the investigation relying on confidential informants and undercover agents to thwart the purported scheme to abduct Whitmer. ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL BARR CALLS WHITMER KIDNAP PLOT 'ABHORRENT' On Friday Berens also was expected to consider whether two of the men Adam Fox and Ty Garbin should be denied bond as they await trial. On Tuesday Berens denied bond for three other men who are charged in the case saying Kaleb Franks Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta repeatedly participated in discussions about abducting Whitmer. A sixth man Barry Croft was ordered separately on Tuesday to be transferred to Michigan from his home state of Delaware. At the preliminary hearing which started Tuesday and continued on Friday FBI agent Richard Trask testified that members of anti-government paramilitary groups from several states discussed abducting Whitmer or Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam during a June meeting in Ohio. Fox and Croft were among those who attended that session according to testimony and federal court documents. But it was not clear if talk of targeting Northam went beyond that meeting and nothing from the complaint or Trask’s testimony indicated that anyone was charged with a plot involving Northam. If convicted the men face up to life in prison. Investigators surveilled the kidnapping plot in August and September according to an FBI affidavit and four of the men planned to meet last week to “make a payment on explosives and exchange tactical gear.” The FBI quoted one of the men as saying Whitmer “has no checks and balances at all. She has uncontrolled power right now. All good things must come to an end.” Earlier this week Whitmer criticized President Trump for making statements that she said emboldened anti-government protesters and white supremacists. A spokesperson did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment on Friday.  WHITMER KIDNAPPING SUSPECT APPEARS TO CRITICIZE TRUMP IN VIRAL VIDEO She pointed to Trump’s debate comments when he did not condemn white supremacist groups and told one far-right extremist group to “stand back and stand by.” “Hate groups heard the president’s words not as a rebuke but as a rallying cry” Whitmer said. “When our leaders speak their words matter. They carry weight. When our leaders meet encourage or fraternize with domestic terrorists they legitimize their actions and they are complicit. When they stoke and contribute to hate speech they are complicit.” Separately seven other men purportedly linked to an extremist paramilitary group called the Wolverine Watchmen were charged in state court last week with providing material support for terrorist acts and possession of a firearm while committing a felony. The seven people were accused of seeking to storm the Michigan Capitol and seek a “civil war.” Michigan’s attorney general charged an eighth person — a Wisconsin man — in that case on Thursday. The state terrorism charges the other seven men face carry possible 20-year sentences. State police said previously that the two groups trained together and planned “various acts of violence."" Defense attorneys implied during the two days of federal hearings that their clients were “big talkers” but had no intention of following through with their threats. They also questioned that the government had actually been able to prove that the accused men formed a pact and that they all planned to participate. WHITMER KIDNAPPING PLOT SUSPECTS ALSO DISCUSSED ABDUCTING VIRGINIA GOVERNOR: FBI AGENT “It’s loose talk” said Scott Graham an attorney for Franks. “And again the point is: What has been done to show you that there was an actual agreement?” Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler though argued that the group repeatedly took steps to protect their communication by using encrypted chat tools and worried that federal authorities had infiltrated the group. Individual defendants also participated in surveillance of Whitmer’s northern Michigan home Kessler said rejecting defense attorneys’ implication that the men participated in paramilitary group exercises without a specific goal or plan. “You’re crossing a pretty serious line when you go in the middle of the night in multiple cars and stage up at a gas station and ... you go to the house of the sitting governor of the state to go surveil their house at night” Kessler said. Berens agreed saying prosecutors didn’t have to show the men “signed on a dotted line.” Berens found that the information presented in testimony and in court documents showed the men had a unified purpose — to kidnap Whitmer — allowing the case to move forward. “The fact that (the plan) was likely to be unsuccessful or difficult to accomplish” she said isn’t relevant to decide whether there is probable cause that they made a plan.

146,ICE arrests 176 in Operation Rise sanctuary city crackdown," Prince Philip allegedly had cold feet before marrying one of the most famous women in the world. The claim is being made in a new book about the Duke of Edinburgh titled “Prince Philip Revealed” by Ingrid Seward. The editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine who has been covering the British royal family since the 1980s and has written more than 20 books on the subject claimed Philip was ""full of doubts"" before marrying Queen Elizabeth II.  Seward claimed that shortly before his royal wedding to the future monarch Philip now 99 went to stay with “the beautiful novelist Daphne du Maurier” in Cornwall the U.K.’s DailyMail reported on Friday. The 72-year-old described their relationship as “emotionally intimate” but “not sexual.” According to the outlet Philip told du Maurier that weekend “I don’t want to go back I want to stay with you.” In response du Maurier replied “Your country needs you.” QUEEN ELIZABETH STEPS OUT WITH PRINCE WILLIAM FOR FIRST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SINCE MARCH For Elizabeth who was a princess at the time she was smitten by the dashing naval officer. According to the outlet Elizabeth told her nanny that she knew almost straight away that Philip was “the one” before he proposed in 1946. The couple tied the knot in 1947 when she was 21 and he was 26. The outlet noted Philip was reportedly concerned about what he was getting himself into. While the couple enjoyed some “happy carefree years” things quickly changed when Elizabeth’s father King George VI died in 1952. Elizabeth’s father only became king because his older brother later known as the Duke of Windsor refused to rule without Wallis Simpson the American divorcee who became his wife. It was a move some saw as shirking his duty to the nation. PRINCE PHILIP IS ‘VERY DISAPPOINTED’ BY MEGHAN MARKLE NOT SUPPORTING MONARCHY ROYAL EXPERT CLAIMS It was then that Philip gave up his naval career and became a full-time consort to his wife the new Queen of England. “Philip was constantly being squashed snubbed ticked off” said Philip’s pal Mike Parker about coping with the “archaic way” things were being run at Buckingham Palace to Seward. Elizabeth and Philip had four children: Charles the Prince of Wales and heir to the throne Anne Andrew and Edward. Elizabeth’s cousin Margaret Rhodes also told Seward that while Philip was “wonderful” with small children “it was when they grew and developed their own personalities that Philip seemed to lose interest.” QUEEN ELIZABETH ROYAL FAMILY FACING ESTIMATED $45M DECLINE IN FUTURE FINANCES DUE TO CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC Seward claimed Philip was particularly tough on his son Charles. The now 71-year-old depicted as sensitive was sent to Gordonstoun a Scottish school Philip attended in hopes he would toughen up. However “the little boy who cowered when his father raised his voice still lurked under the surface.” According to the outlet Philip’s daughter Princess Anne is considered to be “his favorite” and is “as tough and fearless as he is.” But despite his initial concerns Philip has always remained beside Elizabeth now 94. After 65 years of supporting the queen he retired from public life in 2017. At the time he retired Philip was the patron president or a member of more than 780 organizations including many charities. He had given 5496 speeches written 14 books and gone on 637 solo visits overseas in addition to hundreds of trips accompanying the queen. QUEEN ELIZABETH IS TURNING HER SANDRINGHAM ESTATE INTO DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATER As for du Maurier she passed away in 1989 at age 81. Before du Maurier’s passing many of her novels were adapted into Hollywood films. In 2019 Seward released a book titled “My Husband and I” which analyzed the lasting union between the royal couple. In the book Seward investigates allegations of Philip’s affairs that have lingered for decades. As previously reported by Town &amp; Country the Duke of Edinburgh has been linked to numerous women most notably Pat Kirkwood in the 1930s and 1940s a stage actress whose legs were coined “the eighth wonder of the world.” Philip and Kirkwood reportedly met on seven different occasions the first of which Philip went to her dressing room before a performance in London in 1948. That initial meeting purportedly led to dinner and dancing until dawn. Elizabeth who was then a princess was eight months pregnant with Prince Charles at the time. PRINCE ANDREW VISITS QUEEN ELIZABETH AMID EPSTEIN SCANDAL: REPORT According to the U.K.’s Mirror Kirkwood denied claims of any illicit relationship with Prince Phillip until her death in 2007 at age 86. “In my research I never got a conclusive answer” Seward told Fox News about all the rumors. “There’s so much gossip about Philip and his affairs but all the women that deny it that have been picked out of possibilities of having affairs — well most of them are dead now. … And Philip himself obviously denies it.” In addition to Kirkwood Philip has also been linked to other actresses including Helene Cordet Merle Oberon and Anna Massey. People magazine previously reported rumors persisted that Philip was actually the father — not the godfather — of Cordet’s two children. She called the paternity gossip “ridiculous” and claimed they were fathered by French fighter pilot Marcel Boisot. “No one is saying anything [about these stories] and probably won’t until after the queen dies” said Seward. “No one will say anything because anything would be very hurtful to her if indeed they were true. But there are lots of stories. You can’t ignore it.” In 2017 Netflix’s “The Crown” implied Philip may have had an affair with Russian ballerina Galina Ulanova in the 1950s. However People magazine noted there is no evidence that a relationship ever occurred. PRINCE PHILIP 99 MAKES RARE PUBLIC APPEARANCE Despite all the gossip and scandals Elizabeth and Philip had to face over the years their bond endured. “It’s quite extraordinary really” Seward told Fox News at the time. “… In those days it wasn’t quite so unusual to have a young girl fall in love with someone and stay in love with them. But she never really looked at anyone else once she met him. He was just gorgeous. He was so handsome tall blonde and very funny. And you know women love funny men. Women were likely attracted to his looks and charm but he was also an interesting character she said. ""Whatever he may have done in his private life no one has really put their finger on that"" Seward said. ""He’s always put his duty to the queen first.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

According to the study ABC and CNN devoted no time at all to the New York Post's report. The Disney-owned network avoided the subject on ""Good Morning America"" as well as ""World News Tonight."" ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos also failed to ask Biden about the controversy during Thursday night's town hall with the Democratic nominee.  CNN similarly skipped over the Biden scandal.

CNN and all three nightly news programs on ABC CBS and NBC completely avoided the subject.

Jurors took less than four hours to reach a verdict the Omaha World-Herald reported. Prosecutors said Boswell arranged a date with Loofe a Lincoln resident through the Tinder dating app. Defense lawyers argued Boswell was forced to go along with the killing by her boyfriend Aubrey Trail.  Investigators said Loofe's cellphone went dead 24 minutes after arriving in the apartment shared by Boswell and Trail and that she probably was killed quickly.  Prosecutors said Trail admitted to strangling Loofe with an extension cord.  He was found guilty for his role in the killing last year and faces the death penalty.

152,Ohio can't bar maskless voters from elections centers Gov. DeWine says," North Carolina Republican Rep. Ted Budd introduced a bill Friday morning limiting the Section 230 immunity of Big Tech after conservatives blasted social media giants for censoring a New York Post article about the Biden family’s alleged ties to Ukrainian energy firm Burisma.  The bill which mirrors Missouri Republican Josh Hawley’s in the Senate would allow Americans to file lawsuits against Big Tech companies who breach good faith user agreements by censoring political speech or suppressing content. The bill also withholds Section 230 protections from Big Tech companies unless they change their terms of service to promise to operate in good faith. They would agree to be subject to a $5000 fine actual damages and attorney’s fees if they violate the agreement.  “Recent acts of political censorship by Twitter and Facebook are a disgrace” Budd said in a statement announcing the bill. “Big Tech bias has gone too far in suffocating the voices of conservatives across our country. If these companies want to continue to receive legal protection they should be forced to play by a fair set of rules in good faith. I’m extremely proud to join Sen. Hawley in this fight.” HOUSE REPUBLICANS CALL FOR EMERGENCY HEARING ON TWITTER FACEBOOK CENSORSHIP  On Wednesday the Post released a report on purported emails they’d obtained from a whistleblower that appear to show that Hunter Biden introduced his father the then vice president to a top executive at Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings less than a year before the Obama administration pressured government officials in Ukraine to fire prosecutor Viktor Shokin who was investigating the company. Facebook admitted to limiting distribution of the Post story until it could be verified by “independent fact-checkers” and Twitter prohibited the story from being shared via tweet or direct message altogether.  President Trump has called for stripping Big Tech of their Section 230 protections altogether.  Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 states ""no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" The section has been pivotal in the rise of today's social media giants by allowing not only Internet service providers –­ but also Google Twitter Facebook YouTube and others –­ to be shielded from liability from content posted on their platforms by third parties in most cases. But some critics on the right feel that tech giants should no longer benefit from protections of Section 230 if they censor conservative viewpoints including controversial postings by Trump. SENATE REPUBLICANS CALL ON TWITTER FACEBOOK BOSSES TO TESTIFY AMID CENSORSHIP CLAIMS SAY SUBPOENA IN WORKS “Big Tech got something years ago that let them become Big Tech” Trump said of social media platform’s liability protections. “We’re going to take away their Section 230 unless they shape up.” The companion bill in the Senate is led by Sen. Josh Hawley R-Mo. along with Sens. Marco Rubio R-Fla. Mike Braun R-Ind. Tom Cotton R-Ark. and Kelly Loeffler R-Ga. It was introduced in June.  “For too long Big Tech companies like Twitter Google and Facebook have used their power to silence political speech from conservatives without any recourse for users. Section 230 has been stretched and rewritten by courts to give these companies outlandish power over speech without accountability” Hawley said in a statement. “Congress should act to ensure bad actors are not given a free pass to censor and silence their opponents.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee have also called for an emergency hearing before the Nov. 3 election to hold Twitter and Facebook accountable for ""election interference.""

154,Barefoot hiker killed in fall at scenic Arizona red rock canyon," Media pros weren’t exactly shocked by Fox News' exclusive report that two of the questioners at the ABC town hall featuring Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Thursday had ties to high-profile Democrats including one participant who previously worked as a speechwriter in the Obama administration.  “Just as the sky is blue and water is wet the liberal media will show no shame in finding town hall audience members that have partisan ties but present them as quite the opposite” NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News.   The revelation that there were Democrat-tied questioners at the ABC town hall comes after a controversy earlier this month surrounding a Biden town hall held on NBC which on Thursday was carrying the forum with Trump.  BIDEN'S ABC TOWN HALL QUESTIONERS INCLUDE FORMER OBAMA SPEECHWRITER WIFE OF FORMER PENNSYLVANIA DEM CANDIDATE  “What's sad about this continued pattern has been that these shameful networks know they can pull a fast one on viewers because they'll almost never be held to account for their mistakes within their own media and political ecosystems” Houck added. “But that said actual journalists and media observers should continue their dogged pursuit of the facts in fact-checking the backgrounds of these audience members.”  The Hill’s Saagar Enjeti feels someone purposely overlooked the town hall participants’ party backgrounds.   “At this point it’s intentional. Not even negligence can explain this” Enjeti tweeted.   Bongino Report’s Jeremy Frankel joked “Who’s shocked?”   The Washington Free Beacon reported on Oct. 6 that two attendees who were identified as undecided voters at an NBC town hall with Biden had previously been shown on NBC's sister network MSNBC as Biden supporters. BIDEN MOVES ON COURT PACKING STANCE WHILE TRUMP SPARS WITH NBC IN DUELING TOWN HALLS ABC's George Stephanopoulos who was a communications director for the Bill Clinton White House and who has been a political journalist since 2002 hosted the latest town hall event.  When reached for comment about the participants with Democratic ties ABC News directed Fox News to comments made by Stephanopoulos at the beginning of the event.   ""And they're a group of -- some are voting for [Biden] some have said they're voting for President Trump some are still undecided and we're going to try to take questions from as many as we can tonight"" Stephanopoulos told viewers.   ABC News declined additional comment.  'UNDECIDED VOTERS' AT NBC'S BIDEN TOWN HALL WERE FEATURED ON MSNBC AS BIDEN VOTERS “It's with the public's best interest to know if audience members aren't the people the networks claimed they were even if ABC and NBC see no problem with lying to viewers. So yet again what an abject failure last night was for ABC” Houck said.  One of the questioners at the ABC-hosted event was Nathan Osburn a former speechwriter for the Obama White House. Osburn specifically worked for the Office of Public Affairs at the Commerce Department under the Obama-Biden administration and at the Small Business Administration.  Osburn's profession was listed as ""communications"" on the ABC town hall graphic and his city was listed as Philadelphia Pa. He was quoted in the Philadelphia Inquirer earlier this year as ""a former Obama administration speechwriter"" who had created a ""Philly for Pete group"" aimed at boosting former Democratic presidential primary candidate Pete Buttigieg. Another questioner at the town hall was Mieke Haeck who ABC presented as a physical therapist from State College Pa. She is also the wife of Ezra Nanes a high-profile Democrat in Pennsylvania who in 2018 ran a campaign challenging Republican state Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman.

But the members on the House floor and the newspaper and magazine reporters writing about them were the talking heads and Twitter warriors of their day.And in 1894 Rep. William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska was trending.The 34-year-old Democrat had been swept in on a blue wave in 1890 and was about to get swept back out in a midterm backlash against President Grover Cleveland and their party. But Bryan was no Cleveland Democrat. He was a radical populist ever at war with the moderate corporate-friendly mainstream of his party. His heirs like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Matt Gaetz would recognize it all quite well.The years between 1872 and 1896 look quite a lot like our era. Wave election followed wave election as the parties wrestled over a population undergoing major demographic cultural and economic changes. Populists at the extremes of both parties quite often seemed ready to tip the whole government over as voters looked on in dismay.In January of 1894 the nation was being crushed by an economic crisis that was at least as devastating in depth if briefer in length than the Great Depression. Democrats were already at each other’s throats about the causes and solutions for the crisis setting the stage for a smashing GOP victory that fall and Republican dominance for the next 30 years.However much Bryan and his team suspected they might be in the waning days of their control of both houses of Congress and the presidency they were well enough resigned to their fates to focus on fighting amongst themselves rather than uniting to try to fix the economic crisis that was crushing their chances.Since veto-happy Cleveland had shut down the dearest hopes of Bryan and the other populist insurgents – devaluing the dollar big tariffs etc. – the one place they thought they might have him was the re-introduction of an income tax. Cleveland was less concerned about that since the income tax was patently unconstitutional and the Supreme Court had recently and unambiguously struck down the whole concept.So everyone knew that the income tax vote was a symbolic one but the players in the drama knew their audiences would eat it up. Bryan was ready with his clickbait: a stem-winder on the evils of income inequality. There in the glow of new electric lights stood Bryan to deliver the speech that would establish him in the minds of activists and political reporters to such a degree that he could give his more-famous “Cross of Gold” speech two years later. That would lead to the first of his three nominations for president and usher in a period of protracted pain for Democrats. But on that night Bryan was about to become “the boy orator of the Platte.” And he knew who his real audience was.“I read the other day in the New York World” Bryan said of Joseph Pulitzer’s sensationalistic progressive paper as the congressman was setting up the dubious-sounding tale of a rich old miser lady who lived in a rundown boarding house to avoid taxes. “And I gladly join in ascribing praise to that great daily for courageous fight upon this subject in behalf of the common people.”The congressman cites the news report about the congressman’s initiative in a speech being delivered for the purposes of receiving coverage in the same paper. Legislation for the media by the media and of the media.On the one hand we can be relieved that much of our current shallow performative politics predates our current era of shabby showmanship. But on the other hand we are reminded of how ancient the urge is to cheap demagoguery abetted by reporters looking to maximize discord and sensationalism.So about those Supreme Court confirmation hearings…Wasn’t it remarkable how the hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett were pretty much indistinguishable from all other recent nomination hearings (with the obvious exception of the after-action business with Brett Kavanaugh)?The purpose of the hearings was the hearings themselves.We have made the point many times before how damaging it is to have cameras in committee rooms. Politicians will predictably perform for the audience beyond the chamber’s walls rather than use their time for serious inquiry.Whether it is Democrats badgering Bill Barr as if the attorney general would suddenly cop to their claims of corruption or Republicans hectoring Hillary Clinton about Benghazi these hearings have long ago lost even the patina of dispassionate inquiry and oversight.But you could go a step further when it comes to the Supreme Court and other nomination hearings: Do as they did until the Progressive Era and get rid of the hearings altogether.Now hear us out…Certainly the Senate should hold hearings if controversies arise and evidence must be taken. That makes sense. But staging these pseudo-events that obviously exist more for the purpose of scoring political points than dealing with the fitness of Supreme Court nominees? Nah.It would probably be better if the Senate could find a way to return to the old practice of checking presidential nominees for corruption and competence and then advancing all those who pass the smell test. But it would also probably be better if we could uninvent Twitter. Neither is going to happen unfortunately.But ending the harmful exploitive charade of these meaningless hearings would deny the Bryans of our day the chance to further diminish the esteem and credibility of two once-great institutions for their own personal gain.

The Trump administration reported Friday that the deficit for the budget year that ended on Sept. 30 was three times the size of last year’s deficit of $984 billion. It was also $2 trillion higher than the administration had estimated in February before the pandemic hit. It was the government’s largest annual shortfall in dollar terms surpassing the previous record of $1.4 trillion set in 2009. At that time the Obama administration was spending heavily to shore up the nation’s banking system and limit the economic damage from the 2008 financial crisis. The 2020 deficit in terms of its relationship to the economy represented 15.2% of total gross domestic product the sum of all the goods and services produced by the country. That was the highest level since 1945 when the U.S. was borrowing heavily to finance World War II.”TRUMP BIDEN BACK ON THE TRAIL AFTER DUELING TOWN HALLSFox News: “With the November election less than three weeks away President Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden will stump in key battleground states on Friday making a final appeal to voters one night after their dueling town halls. The candidates participated in competing town halls in different cities on different networks Thursday night: Trump on NBC from Miami and Biden on ABC from Philadelphia. … Trump will start his day by campaigning in Florida a vital swing state. … Once that concludes Trump will travel to Georgia for a second rally in Macon which is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET. … The former vice president is making a swing through southeastern Michigan with planned stops in Southfield and Detroit. Biden's campaign said the candidate will deliver remarks on protecting and expanding access to health care in Southfield before heading to Detroit for a ‘voter mobilization event.’”Trump gets pressed on QAnon - NYT: “In perhaps his most incendiary remarks Mr. Trump repeatedly declined to disavow QAnon a pro-Trump internet community that has been described by law enforcement as a potential domestic terrorism threat. The president professed to have no knowledge of the group and as a result could not disavow it but then demonstrated specific knowledge of one of its core conspiracy theories involving pedophilia that is entirely false. ‘I know nothing about it’ Mr. Trump said. ‘I do know they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard.’ When the NBC anchor Savannah Guthrie pressed Mr. Trump to reject the community’s essential worldview and described some of its most extreme and bogus elements the president gave no ground: ‘I don’t know’ he insisted. ‘No I don’t know.’”And conspiracy theory retweets - USA Today: “NBC moderator Savannah Guthrie prodded President Donald Trump Thursday during his town hall when talking about him retweeting conspiracy theories saying he's not just ‘someone's crazy uncle.’ Guthrie pressed Trump on his penchant for tweets that spread disinformation including one post he retweeted that contained a conspiracy theory that former Vice President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama orchestrated a cover-up that included the Navy SEAL Team Six faking the death of terrorist Osama bin Laden. ‘That was a retweet. That was an opinion of somebody and that was a retweet. I'll put it out there. People can decide for themselves.

He continued: ‘If young Black women and men vote you could determine the outcome of this election. Not a joke. You can do that.’”Biden leads in town hall viewership - Variety: “Presidential candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump appeared in directly competing town halls on Thursday night after the President dropped out of the second debate. Trump’s hourlong appearance on NBC which drew criticism across the industry and even an angry letter from top talent and showrunners who work with NBCU appears to be trailing Biden’s 90-minute session with ABC in the ratings at least according to early numbers. Biden drew 12.7 million total viewers on the Disney-owned network while Trump drew 10.4 million in the same 9-10 p.m. time slot on NBC. Across the entire runtime the Biden town hall averaged 12.3 million viewers.

Chief Executive Jack Dorsey after the social-media company blocked a pair of New York Post articles that made new allegations about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden which his campaign has denied. The subpoena would require the Twitter executive to testify on Oct. 23 before the committee according to the Republicans who announced the hearing. GOP lawmakers are singling out Twitter because it prevented users from posting links to the articles which the Post said were based on email exchanges with Hunter Biden the Democratic candidate’s son provided by allies of President Trump. Those people in turn said they received them from a computer-repair person who found them on a laptop according to the Post. The Wall Street Journal hasn’t independently verified the Post articles.”NatSec adviser warned Trump that Rudy could be a conduit for Kremlin - NYT: “The intelligence agencies warned the White House late last year that Russian intelligence officers were using President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani as a conduit for disinformation aimed at undermining Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential run according to four current and former American officials. … Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have promoted unsubstantiated claims about Mr. Biden that have aligned with Russian disinformation efforts and Mr. Giuliani has met with a Ukrainian lawmaker whom American officials believe is a Russian agent. Robert C. O’Brien the national security adviser presented the warning about Mr. Giuliani to Mr. Trump in December. Two former officials gave conflicting accounts about its nature. One said the report was presented to Mr. Trump as unverified and vague but another said the intelligence agencies had developed solid and credible information that Mr. Giuliani was being ‘worked over’ by Russian operatives.”TRUMP FACES CASH CHASM IN CLOSING WEEKSFox News: “The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) raised a massive $247.8 million in September an impressive haul as the 2020 cycle hit its final stretch -- though still short of his Democratic rival Joe Biden who raked in $383 million in the same time period. … The Trump campaign the Republican National Committee and its joint-fundraising committees brought in $247.8 million in September and combined have a whopping $251.4 million cash on hand. ‘POTUS has done more in 47 months than Biden in 47 years’ [Tim] Murtaugh [tweeted].

The Adelsons gave the massive sum to Preserve America PAC accounting for roughly 90 percent of the group’s fundraising in September according to a person familiar with the group's finances who shared details with POLITICO ahead of the group's campaign finance filing. The money for Preserve America brought the Adelsons' giving to Republican candidates and committees to a whopping $176 million for the 2020 election cycle according to FEC data. The couple had previously given $50 million to Senate Leadership Fund the GOP super PAC focused on defending the Senate majority.”Senate Dems see a cash surge - NYT: “Democratic candidates in competitive Senate races received another surge in donations over the last few months with some breaking fund-raising records in their states and many entering the final weeks of the campaign with significant stores of cash according to new quarterly filings with election authorities this week. ActBlue the central platform for donations to Democratic candidates and causes announced that from July 1 to Sept. 30 it had processed $1.5 billion in contributions — an amount roughly equal to what the site raised during the entire 2018 election cycle and one far exceeding the $623.5 million that the equivalent Republican platform WinRed took in during the quarter.”WORD OF INFIGHTING AS TRUMP WOES DEEPENAxios: “Three senior Trump advisers who recently talked to campaign manager Bill Stepien walked away believing he thinks they will lose. … Several campaign officials say they don't have a clear sense what Stepien's strategy is to get to 270 electoral votes. In internal conversations Stepien and other senior officials often use the word ‘optionality’ to describe the decision to keep dabbling in every Rust Belt battleground and preserve multiple paths to 270. Critics hear ‘optionality’ as a cover for indecision keeping small pots of money spread across numerous states rather than picking a path and committing to it. One campaign adviser pointed to a ‘half-assed’ advertising buy in Wisconsin this week around $130000 according to Advertising Analytics data which two campaign sources said seemed pointless given it's too small to move the needle. Ditto the decision to stay on the air in Minnesota a state that no one I spoke to sees as part of Trump's path to 270. But Stepien's dilemma as described by several advisers is that Trump would inevitably blow up at him if he were to read newspaper stories that he was going off the air in a Rust Belt battleground.”Final presidential debate topics released - AP: “President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden will face questions on the coronavirus race issues and climate change in the final presidential debate next week. Moderator Kristen Welker of NBC released the six topics for the debate Friday through the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. They are ‘Fighting COVID-19’ ‘American Families’ ‘Race in America’ ‘Climate Change’ ‘National Security’ and ‘Leadership.’ Trump and Biden will take the stage together for 90 minutes on Oct. 22 in Nashville three weeks after their first meeting in Cleveland. A second outing planned for Oct. 15 was called off after Trump’s coronavirus diagnosis and his refusal to participate in a virtual debate. Trump and Biden held town halls on different networks at the same time instead.”The real story about Wisconsin - FiveThirtyEight: “Wisconsin is proof that politicos have short memories. …Now-President Trump carried Wisconsin by 0.8 percentage points [in 2016] reaffirming its status as a swing state. It was the third time in five presidential elections that Wisconsin was decided by less than a point. Fast forward to 2020 and both sides are rightly treating it as a potential tipping point state. According to the FiveThirtyEight forecast1 Wisconsin has a 13 percent chance of providing the decisive vote in the Electoral College; only Pennsylvania and Florida are likelier tipping points. Conventional wisdom says that Clinton lost Wisconsin because she infamously did not visit the state at all during the final seven months of the 2016 campaign. But that’s probably not true; Clinton devoted a lot of effort to winning Pennsylvania and still lost there for instance. Instead Wisconsin probably got redder in 2016 for the same reason that Pennsylvania and other Midwestern states did: demographics.”GRAHAM DOMINATES IN NEW SOUTH CAROLINA POLLNYT: “President Trump and Senator Lindsey Graham have established clear but not overwhelming advantages in South Carolina a heavily Republican state that is showing signs of competitiveness this year according to a new New York Times/Siena College poll. Mr. Trump leads Joseph R. Biden Jr. 49 percentage points to 41 while Mr. Graham who is facing the most serious challenge of his career is winning 46 percent of the vote compared with 40 percent for his Democratic rival Jaime Harrison. The Senate race though may be even more competitive because the survey finds that 12 percent of Black voters are undecided a vote share that is likely to favor Mr. Harrison who is African-American. The poll has a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points. … It’s this coalition of voters that’s pushing Mr. Trump’s advantage into single-digits four years after he carried South Carolina by 14 points and that has made the race between Mr. Graham and Mr. Harrison perhaps the most surprisingly close Senate matchup of 2020.”McSally swamped - Monmouth University: “Joe Biden leads Donald Trump in Arizona making small gains in the past month. The Monmouth (‘Mon-muth’) University Poll finds the Democrat maintaining a large advantage among Latino voters and a small edge in all-important Maricopa County.

If someone says ‘Pigs can fly’ there's no proof that pigs can't fly. All you can really say is that there's no proof that they can. This is not being snarky. The same thing is true of ‘There's massive voter fraud at the polls’ or ‘Voting by mail will lead to massive cheating.’ There's no evidence of either of those things as many experts have said. The burden of proof is on Trump. The press could cite these experts and they have but that's really the same as saying ‘without evidence.’ Trump has made these and other false claims so many times that he doesn't deserve anything more than that.” – Nigel Bannish Lexington Ky.[Ed. note: Whoa whoa whoa Mr. Bannish! I said that the assertion should be let stand ignored or refuted. If Trump did say that pigs fly the reporter could feel free to ignore the claim if it was not central to the story. Or she could say that she called the USDA which confirmed that pigs cannot fly. If the matter is material then readers ought to have answers not just snarky shorthand. It’s not about what you think the presidents deserve. It’s about what readers deserve.

156,If you want less gas cut off the oxygen," A federal judge ruled that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s coronavirus-related restrictions are allowable despite acknowledgement that continued limitations will make the economic recovery more difficult. Brooklyn U.S. District Judge Brian M. Cogan said safety restrictions and guidelines may even “turn New York City into a very different even desolate place compared to how it was before the pandemic” but he declined to grant a preliminary injunction against rules that prohibit restaurants from serving food after midnight. Indoor dining is also restricted to 25% capacity as of Sept. 30. In a written opinion issued on Friday Cogan explained he afforded “great deference to the governor’s judgement.” “There is room for significant disagreement about the wisdom and efficacy of the Governor’s protective measures” Cogan said. “But it is not the role of the courts to second-guess the Governor’s approach.” Cogan noted that business lost due to restrictions is “likely an irreparable harm.” CUOMO DE BLASIO PUT FEUD OVER SAFETY AS CORONAVIRUS CRACKDOWN LEADS TO CHAOS IN NYC: REPORT  The lawsuit was brought by a Brooklyn-based bar known as The Graham which argued that discrepancies in regulations across counties are based on “the capricious whims of the governor” rather than science. The measures attorneys for the bar said are harming its business because it typically generates a lot of sales after midnight. The eatery also said the virus does not “behave as a vampire infecting others only when the moon is out” indicating restrictions imposed late at night are arbitrary. In response to the decision an attorney for the eatery said the governor has 'no excuse"" to act without evidence. ""New York entirely made up the midnight food curfew without any scientific basis and that is exactly the kind of arbitrary conduct the courts should not allow"" the lawyer said. Cuomo’s team applauded the court's acknowledgement of the state's responsibility to protect public health. ""We understand that not everyone likes the rules but we are still in a global pandemic and better to be unhappy than sick or worse"" a spokesperson for the governor's office said. ""Wear a mask wash your hands socially distance and follow the rules -- for everyone's sake.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Trump has been critical of some governors in blue states that have left coronavirus restrictions in place. On Thursday night during a townhall in Miami he specifically mentioned New York which he said is “a mess.” “They lost almost 40000 people. They have a lockdown like you’ve never seen” Trump said. “People are leaving New York by the thousands and you’re going to have a hard time ever building it up again.” New York was hit particularly hard with the virus during the early spring – there are more than 19260 confirmed deaths.

157,Federal judge says Cuomo coronavirus restrictions may turn NYC ‘desolate’ but allows them," The Senate Commerce Committee has called the leaders of Facebook Twitter and Google to testify Wednesday amid outrage over censorship of articles damaging to former Vice President Joe Biden.  The chair of the committee Sen. Roger Wicker R-Miss. announced the hearing will examine whether Big Tech should still be afforded liability protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act or whether the federal shield ""has outlived its usefulness in today’s digital age."" SENATE REPUBLICANS CALL ON TWITTER FACEBOOK BOSSES TO TESTIFY AMID CENSORSHIP CLAIMS SAY SUBPOENA IN WORKS The announced witnesses for the 10 a.m. hearing on Oct. 28 are Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai CEO of Alphabet and Google. The hearing comes as Twitter took extraordinary steps to stop the social media spread of New York Post articles on purported emails from Hunter Biden that allegedly link the former vice president to his son's business dealing in Ukraine. Twitter went so far as to lock the account of the newspaper and the Trump campaign for tweeting about the New York Post's findings claiming the article violated Twitter rules.  Twitter has since backed off and announced new policies.  ""Straight blocking of URLs was wrong and we updated our policy and enforcement to fix"" Dorsey tweeted Friday. ""Our goal is to attempt to add context and now we have capabilities to do that."" TWITTER ANNOUNCES NEW POLICIES AFTER HUNTER BIDEN REPORT IMBROGLIO But the suppression of the article caused outrage among Republicans with President Trump and others calling for a repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 that states ""no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" The section has been pivotal in the rise of today's social media giants by allowing not only Internet service providers –­ but also Google Twitter Facebook YouTube and others –­ to be shielded from liability from content posted on their platforms by third parties in most cases. But some critics on the right feel that tech giants should no longer benefit from protections of Section 230 if they censor conservative viewpoints including controversial postings by Trump. TWITTER SAYS TRUMP CAMPAIGN 'VIOLATED' RULES LOCKS ACCOUNT OVER TWEET REFERENCING HUNTER BIDEN REPORT ""It is clear that section 230 in its current form is no longer working"" Rep. Kevin McCarthy R-Calif. said Thursday. ""It is time to scrap the law and start over"" McCarthy added. Wednesday's scheduled appearance for the tech executives may be just the beginning. The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote Tuesday on a subpoena for Dorsey to testify before the committee on Friday Oct. 23. And Sen. Josh Hawley R-Mo. is pushing for Zuckerburg to be included too. Hawley already wrote the Facebook and Twitter executives to testify before his Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism at a date to be determined. The focus of that hearing would be on election interference and whether social media companies violated campaign finance law by suppressing the articles critical of Biden.  RNC FILES FEC COMPLAINT AGAINST TWITTER CLAIMS COMPANY MADE 'ILLEGAL IN-KIND CONTRIBUTION' TO BIDEN CAMPAIGN ""The attempt to rig an election which is what we're seeing here by monopolies is unprecedented in American history"" Hawley said this week.

The dueling town halls were scheduled for the exact same time after the second scheduled debate between Trump and Biden was canceled last week after the president balked at the decision to hold the town hall-style debate in a virtual format.

""Why he doesn't just come out and say one way or the other is beyond me"" Rove added. ""The excuse that he wants to see how the Republicans handle the confirmation of soon-to-be Justice [Amy Coney] Barrett is baloney.""

He may want to come out and say 'I'm in favor of it because of this egregious overreach by Republicans during the confirmation hearings.'

""It is with great honor that I write this letter to endorse your campaign as you run for re-election of the President of the United States"" Hughes said. ""I am happy to support your administration as you have proven to be a true friend of the Boilermakers and I wish you the best of luck in your campaign."" Fox News reached out to the Biden campaign for comment but they did not immediately respond. BIDEN SAYS 'IT DEPENDS' ON COURT-PACKING VACCINE MANDATE AT ABC TOWN HALL AS ELECTION NEARS Biden has faced criticism for being vague in how he has addressed fracking. During a July 2019 debate CNN's Dana Bash asked him ""Just to clarify would there be any place for fossil fuels including coal and fracking in a Biden administration? ""No we would -- we would work it out"" Biden said. ""We would make sure it's eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those either -- any fossil fuel."" Biden took a different tone when addressing a more targeted audience in Pennsylvania a key battleground state. In an April interview with Pittsburgh's KDKA Biden said he would only ban new fracking on federal property claiming that this would only impact a small percentage of overall fracking. ""No I would not shut down this industry"" Biden said. ""I know our Republican friends are trying to say I said that. I said I would not do any new leases on federal lands. Ninety percent of the leases are not on federal land to begin with. I would make sure … the water is not being contaminated. But I would not shut it down no.""

With the holidays on the horizon we must take these additional steps over the next 30 days and knuckle down together to do the hard work that needs to be done so we can all enjoy this upcoming holiday season.” OHIO CAN'T BAR MASKLESS VOTERS FROM ELECTIONS CENTERS GOV. DEWINE SAYS Increased face mask mandates requiring people to wear masks even when outside have been enforced in Denver and Denver County and permitted gathering sizes have been reduced from 10 to five people until Nov. 16. “If you can go virtual go virtual” Hancock said advising people to work from home when possible. Colorado has seen record-breaking spikes in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the last week reporting the highest daily case load Monday with 1005 cases – the highest daily figure reported throughout the entire pandemic. Prior to this week the highest number of daily coronavirus cases reported was in April with 967 cases. Friday saw another spike with 993 confirmed cases. Hancock told Denver citizens that if they do not take increase precautions “we likely will fall backwards on the state’s Safer at Home dial to Level 3 and that would be devastating to our economy.”HEALTHY YOUNG PEOPLE MAY WAIT FOR CORONAVIRUS VACCINE UNTIL 2022 WHO OFFICIAL SAYS “We are working to strike a balance between keeping people healthy and keeping Denver’s economy alive” Hancock said Friday. The new mask orders only apply when people are not with members of their own household and when social distancing cannot be achieved. Though in a press release from the mayor’s office Friday they said they hoped the five-person limit will be practiced in private settings in people’s homes as well. Exercise groups are now required to limit their numbers to five or fewer while organized sports groups are not required to follow the new rules because they have had their own strict regulations. The new policy also does not apply to restaurants which are regulated through the state and have previously established protective measures -- meaning groups of 10 from different households are still allowed to meet in a restaurant setting. “We have a responsibility to our community to enact reasonable measures that can temper the rising numbers” Robert McDonald Denver’s public health administrator said Friday. “If we work together now and follow these basic rules we hope to decrease and stabilize our case numbers. This is how we keep our businesses and restaurants open and our community safe” he added. “If we are successful we will hopefully enjoy more freedoms and less fear during the upcoming holidays.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Colorado has confirmed nearly 82000 cases of coronavirus since the beginning of the pandemic according to its Department of Public Health and Environment – nearly 20% of the state’s cases have come from Denver. , https://www.foxnews.com/us/denver-orders-new-mask-mandate-amid-spiking-cases,0.8102817222569845

In Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin workers are not allowed to prepare and scan ballots before Election Day a process called pre-canvassing. “If the state legislature and the governor don't change that law we will never have results on election night” said David Pedri Luzerne County’s manager. There’s a bill moving through the courts in Pennsylvania now that if passed would allow workers to start checking ballots the Saturday before Election Day. PENNSYLVANIA TUG OF WAR OVER BALLOT COUNTING COULD DRAG OUT ELECTION RESULT “Under Pennsylvania law right now we're not allowed to pre-canvass these mailing ballots until Election Day at 7 a.m.” said Pedri. Local officials like Pedri say the final count won't be ready on Election Day unless they can start counting ballots earlier. “Will it take months? Probably not. Could it take weeks? Probably” said Jennifer Morrell a member of the National Task Force on Election Crises. Morrell ran elections in Utah and Colorado. Now she’s helping in Pennsylvania and says checking ballots takes longer than one would think.    “Open a ballot take out an envelope open it again remove a piece of paper unfold it flatten it and get it ready for scanning. Then take that and times that by thousands or hundreds of thousands and you start to get an idea of the amount of time it requires to do something that - on its face sounds really simple right? Taking a ballot out of an envelope is often the thing that takes the most time” said Morrell. Luzerne County is a swing county in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. “Donald Trump won Luzerne County by 26000 votes after voting for Barack Obama twice in the previous two elections” said Pedri. Election workers there are dealing with more mail-in ballots than ever. BATTLEGROUND STATE LAWMAKERS SEEK LAW CHANGES TO AVOID 'MAN-MADE DISASTER' OF MAIL-IN BALLOT DELAYS “We're getting more every day” said Shelby Watchilla Luzerne County’s Director of Elections. According to Watchilla more than 60000 people in Luzerne County registered to vote by mail. There are about 216000 total registered voters in the county. “People are going to be looking at Pennsylvania and they're going to be looking at Luzerne County for these votes. We won't have the results on election night unless they start allowing us to pre-canvass earlier” said Pedri. Pedri’s worried a delayed final count could raise concerns amongst voters. “That's when people start worrying about things like voter fraud stealing the election what's out there? People want the results on election night. Doesn’t everybody want to be done with this election by now?” said Pedri. Pennsylvania's Senate will only be in session three more times to potentially vote on House Bill 2626 before the November election. , https://www.foxnews.com/politics/critical-swing-states-longer-count-mail-in-ballots,0.8103353085662952

Gavin Newsom's Office of Emergency Services said that the White House had rejected its request for emergency funds and that the state would appeal it.  FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor sent Newsom a letter Oct. 14 that said ""it has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state affected local governments and voluntary agencies.""  WILDFIRE SMOKE IN US EXPOSES MILLIONS TO HAZARDOUS POLLUTION A FEMA spokesperson also told Fox News earlier in the day Friday that the request had been denied because ""damage assessments FEMA conducted"" determined that the federal government's assistance wasn't necessary.  That assessment changed at some point on Friday.  “Just got off the phone with President Trump who has approved our Major Disaster Declaration request"" Newsom said Friday afternoon in a statement. ""Grateful for his quick response.""  A spokesman for California's Office of Emergency Services told Fox News that it ""appears the federal government has reversed course.""

168,Arson investigator arson suspect fatally shot in Houston," As conservatives' fears of election fraud roil Nevada one of only two states to mail ballots to every voter this election Nicholas Trutanich the state's U.S. attorney announced Friday that he would appoint a “district election officer” to handle concerns of voter fraud in conjunction with the Department of Justice.  ""Every citizen must be able to vote without interference or discrimination and to have that vote counted without it being stolen because of election fraud. The Department of Justice will act appropriately to protect the integrity of the election process"" Trutanich said in a statement.  Earlier this year Nevada’s Democratic legislature passed a bill to make it a universal mail-in state. Every registered voter is automatically being mailed a ballot. Another notable provision in the Nevada law is that it will allow third parties to collect and hand in ballots on voters' behalf a practice detractors call ""ballot harvesting."" Previously only a voter or their immediate family member could return their ballot.  But the Trump team in Nevada said they’ve received dozens of complaints of ballots being sent to the wrong address names misspelled and other issues. They’ve provided photos of ballots being delivered to the wrong mailbox or no mailbox at all and ballots strewn on the ground or resting atop piles of trash. In Clark County home to Las Vegas and 70 percent of the state’s electorate Trump Victory spokesman Keith Schipper said he’s received reports of apartment complexes “being littered with ballots sent to folks that no longer live at the complex or ballots sent to the wrong place.” “Everything that we warned was going to happen is now coming to fruition” Schipper told Fox News.  The Trump campaign sued Nevada in August over its election plan claiming universal ballots would undermine the election’s “integrity.” The untended ballots in Clark County might be the result of 75000 virtually inactive voters who will receive ballots after the county registrar missed a deadline to remove them from the roll.   The Clark County Registrar removed these 75000 voters from the roll after their ballots were returned as undeliverable during the primary meaning the voter no longer lived at that address. But days after the county removed them from the roll the Secretary of State forced their voter status to be reactivated because the county had missed a federal deadline to remove them. “If I’m a voter and I see a live ballot just laying around… you’ve got to think at least subconsciously that your vote is being degraded. Here’s a ballot just laying around that anyone could just pick up and try to get through” he continued.  “A lot of people are getting multiple ballots because maybe there’s some little change like their last name is misspelled or something is awry. With multiple ballots it’s confusing to know which is the ballot they’re supposed to turn in” Schipper said. In one instance a former Nevada resident who hadn’t voted since 2016 and moved to Colorado had her ballot forwarded to her. “That isn’t permissible they’re not supposed to be forwardable” Schipper said.  TRUMP TEAM THINKS NEVADA IS IN PLAY. IS IT?  In Humboldt County voters were mailed ballots that had the wrong county listed on their return envelope. Their ballot return envelopes listed “White Pine County.” The county had to mail voters new ballots along with a letter explaining the issue.  Voters in Lyon County had to be mailed all-new ballots after instruction sheets sent along with ballots were not updated to reflect the new provision allowing any third party to return a ballot.  Former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt believes the careless treatment of ballots in the state could lead to high levels of fraud.  “Nevada is simply not prepared to guarantee a safe and free election” Laxalt told Fox News.  He first points to the state’s identity verification which is done in Clark County through a machine that verifies ballot signatures match the signatures on record. But the county lowered the accuracy of the signatures to pass to 40 percent. If a signature is a 40 percent match of the one on record the ballot is accepted.  Ballots are then reviewed by elections workers two of whom must agree that the ballot’s signature “differs in multiple significant and obvious respects” than the signature on record before challenging it. The voter is then given the opportunity to correct either the signature on record or the one on the ballot. NEVADA MAIL-IN VOTING: WHAT TO KNOW  “What does that mean? There’s no written standard that defines it” Axalt said of the “multiple significant” difference rule to allow a ballot to be challenged. “And when’s the last time you signed your signature at the DMV? The whole match system is inherently unreliable.”  “Plenty of people have their kids go off to college and their ballots mailed to their house quite obviously that parent can't vote for their kids that’s illegal. Do you honestly think that doesn’t happen sometimes? That people aren’t filling out ballots for other people?” he continued.   “I get people all the time they’ll text me or email me. they’ll say I got all these extra ballots at my house I got [ballots for] kids that haven't lived here in six years what are we supposed to do with these?” Axalt said. “Most are going to be honest but again it doesn’t take much for a percentage of the population to be dishonest and to vote improperly.”  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Even if you think it's one or two percent” who might vote improperly Axalt continued “That’s 10000 votes or 20000 votes.

170,Chicago woman's self-written obituary goes viral for her wise advice, Pennsylvania has cast off hundreds of thousands of applications for mail-in ballots ahead of the 2020 election because of confusion about the process. About 372000 requests were rejected as reported by ProPublica on Friday largely because many of them about 90% were duplicates. Overall one out of every five requests for mail-in ballots are being rejected according to the publication. The main reason? Many people who voted during the June primaries may have already checked a box to request a mail-in ballot for the November election. However people who made more than one request should eventually receive their ballot a spokesperson for the Pensylvania State Department said. They can also head to the polls on Election Day. PENNSYLVANIA TUG OF WAR OVER BALLOT COUNTING COULD DRAG OUT ELECTION RESULT The spokesperson said about 2 million people have selected an option to automatically have ballots sent for the current calendar year meaning they do not need to reapply. More than 2.7 million Pennsylvanians have requested mail-in ballots this election.  The state is expecting a record volume of ballots to be sent by mail and as it stands counties can’t begin the cumbersome process necessary to ultimately tally those votes until Election Day. There is an ongoing discussion in the state legislature to allow pre-canvassing to begin in the days leading up to the election although an agreement hasn't been struck. There is concern that the longer it takes Pennsylvania to tally its final vote count the more likely it is that there will be misgivings about the security of the process. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Pennsylvania Supreme Court added to the confusion when it ruled that if a ballot is not mailed in a “secrecy” envelope it is to be rejected which adds an additional step to counting the ballots. The court will also take up whether a ballot should be dismissed if a signature is markedly different than the one stored in the voter registration database. Meanwhile there is another ongoing battle in the court system over the timeframe for mail-in ballots to be counted. As it stands the Supreme Court has allowed for ballots that are postmarked by Election Day and received by Nov. 6 to be counted. , https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-mail-in-ballot-applications-rejected,0.8103233218854019
171,370K Pennsylvania mail-in ballot applications rejected: Report," Michigan announced a ban on Friday of the open carry of guns at polling places to avoid voter harassment and intimidation during the critical swing state election.   The announcement by Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson drew a quick rebuke from some Republicans and gun rights activists including the National Rifle Association but the Democratic official said firearms at voting sites could cause fear and disruption for election workers and Michiganders trying to cast their ballots on Nov. 3. CASE AGAINST WHITMER KIDNAPPING SUSPECTS CAN MOVE TO TRIAL JUDGE RULES “Fair free and secure elections are the foundation of our democracy” Benson said in a statement. “I am committed to ensuring all eligible Michigan citizens can freely exercise their fundamental right to vote without fear of threats intimidation or harassment. Prohibiting the open-carry of firearms in areas where citizens cast their ballots is necessary to ensure every voter is protected."" Michigan leaders have been on high alert for armed intimidation in the wake of gun-carrying protesters storming the Michigan Capitol and a foiled plot by Michigan militia extremists attempting to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. President Trump who has repeatedly warned of voter fraud urged his supporters to be vigilant and ""to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what has to happen."" Grassroots efforts are underway to do so. Bridge Magazine reports that thousands of poll watchers and challengers are expected to descend on precincts throughout Michigan on Nov. 3.  NEW POLLS IN KEY BATTLEGROUNDS RAISE CONCERNS FOR TRUMP Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined with Benson in support of the open carry ban.  “Michigan voters have the right to vote in person on Election Day free from threat and intimidation"" Nessel said. ""An armed presence at the polls is inconsistent with our notion of a free democracy."" Benson's directive said that the open carry of firearms is prohibited inside any polling place any hallway used by voters to enter and exit or within 100 feet outside the building entrance.  But Joey Roberts president of Michigan Open Carry said the Whitmer Administration has not been very gun-friendly and now they are ""punishing"" gun owners for the actions of the 14 men allegedly involved in the kidnapping plot. ""The Secretary of State doesn't have the authority to do this"" Roberts told Fox News adding that they are considering filing a lawsuit to challenge the ban. ""Litigation is not off the table."" Roberts also views the open carry ban as an attempt to suppress the vote of gun owners.  ""Me walking into a polling location openly carrying my pistol is not intimidating anybody"" he said.  The NRA also opposed the ban with spokeswoman Amy Hunter telling the Detroit News this ""ill-conceived action only eradicates the right to self-defense by law-abiding Michiganders."" At least one county sheriff said he won't enforce the ban. ""An order is an order and quite frankly is unenforceable"" Mike Murphy sheriff of Livingston County which is located northwest of Detroit told the paper. ""They have no authority to supersede law.” Triston Cole a state Republican lawmaker blasted the directive on Facebook as ""an in your face unconstitutional ban"" and accused Democrats of trying to ""take your guns and your Second Amendment rights away.""

174,What Hollywood has said about Biden and Trump," NEW YORK – A conservative Staten Island artist known for painting American flag murals in each of the 50 states is planning a mayoral run in New York City where he said “a monkey with no eyes” could do a better job than the current administration. “I’m not a politician but neither was Ronald Reagan neither was Donald Trump” Scott LoBaido a 55-year-old self-described “creative patriot” told Fox News on Thursday evening. “Why shouldn’t I run? I can’t do any worse than this clown.” He criticized New York Mayor Bill de Blasio a Democrat over the city’s high taxes handling of the coronavirus small-business regulations lack of support for police and exodus of residents and businesses. “I think a monkey with no eyes could take over this office and fix this insanity” he said. “So I think I could do it.” De Blasio’s ongoing feuds with the city’s police religious communities and even Gov. Andrew Cuomo a fellow Democrat have plagued his administration. DE BLASIO'S DESCENT: HOW NEW YORK CITY'S MAYOR BECAME SO UNPOPULAR ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM He’s also frequently butted heads with President Trump. And Staten Island’s Democratic Rep. Max Rose recently called him “the worst mayor in the history of New York City” in a congressional reelection campaign ad. LoBaido has feuded with the mayor too. He responded to New York City’s “Black Lives Matter” mural outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue by painting a “Thin Blue Line” at a Staten Island police precinct in support of the NYPD which prompted threats of a lawsuit. ARTIST BLASTS 'SELECTIVE ENFORCEMENT' AFTER NYC ORDERS REMOVAL OF PRO-POLICE ARTWORK He also draped a now-infamous banner off an overpass depicting de Blasio in a Che Guevara T-shirt holding the severed head of the Statue of Liberty. LoBaido said that as an artist he is the voice of a lot of people including small business owners police officers “one-job moms” and even the Wall Street crowd who he said can’t speak their minds for fear of losing their livelihoods. A self-described conservative Republican he said even his liberal friends and family don't ""have anything nice to say about this mayor."" “I am that activist for them” he said. De Blasio is not expected to be in the next mayoral race due to term limits. POLICE UNION SLAMS NYC LEADERS FOR 'AMATEUR-HOUR MEDDLING' THAT DROVE CHIEF OUT Asked who his favorite former New York City mayor is LoBaido said Rudy Giuliani who served from 1994 until 2001 and helped dramatically reduce crime in the Big Apple. In that vein LoBaido said his first order of business would be to increase the NYPD’s budget by at least 10 percent. De Blasio and city councilmembers recently agreed to slash police funding by $1 billion – even as the city sees sharp spikes in violent crime. Shootings have risen by 127 percent in the city this year according to police and murders are up 76 percent. ARTIST CALLS ATTENTION TO VETERAN SUICIDES IN NEW PROJECT LoBaido said public safety particularly in minority neighborhoods is more important than any other issue facing the city. “A safe community is a prosperous community” LoBaido said. “It’s the most commonsense thing.” He also said he wanted to explore ways to safely reopen the city’s schools and ease restrictions on restaurant owners which he said were oppressive even before the COVID-19 shutdown. Under de Blasio’s administration LoBaido argued New York has become “horrifying” “surreal” and a shadow of the “Crossroads of the World” it once was. “Lower Manhattan it’s a ghost town” LoBaido said referring to one of the city’s busiest areas in normal times. “It saddens me it hurts me. That’s not what this city is.” LoBaido also said he wants to take down controversial speed cameras “another money-sucking scam on the hardworking people of this city” and find a way to reverse the mass exodus of well-off residents and businesses.

In the meantime he’s working to help get President Trump reelected.

Likely GOP contenders include billionaire John Catsimatidis and Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa whom LoBaido described as his “good friend.” ", https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-trump-artist-scott-lobaido-nyc-mayor-bill-de-blasio,0.8103399367106431

176,Herschel Walker: Biden gave 'insulting' town hall response after being challenged on 'you ain't Black' remark, The Sun understands married Lord Darroch’s passionate affair with CNN diplomatic correspondent Michelle Kosinski went on for at least several months. The Department of Justice probe into the 66-year-old diplomat is thought to be the first into a serving British ambassador in Washington. It was launched after top US government officials were “astonished” by a series of articles by Kosinski 46 One story about plans for a top–secret visit to North Korea by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sparked horror with US security interests said to be at risk. TRUMP FIRES BACK AT UK AMBASSADOR WHO ATTACKED HIM: 'WE ARE NOT BIG FANS OF THAT MAN' Lord Darroch married for 42 years and with two grown-up children is believed to have fiercely denied any impropriety and any suggestion he was the leaker — and he was eventually cleared. Ironically he quit his post in July last year after his own diplomatic cables were leaked showing he had branded President Donald Trump “inept” and “incompetent”. Kosinski’s public LinkedIn profile shows she left her post at CNN five months later. TRUMP SAYS US WILL 'NO LONGER DEAL' WITH BRITISH AMBASSADOR AFTER LEAKED ANTI-TRUMP CABLES A security source said: “The leaks of the cables last year were obviously deeply embarrassing and left Darroch no option but to resign once President Trump made his feelings clear. “But for the US to investigate the most senior diplomat of its greatest ally on suspicion of leaking secret information is almost unprecedented. “Although the investigation found nothing over Darroch the fact it happened is extraordinary.” The Sun understands married Lord Darroch’s passionate affair with Michelle Kosinski went on for at least several monthsLord Darroch from South Stanley Co Durham had joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1977 and tied the knot the following year. He was Tony Blair’s European Union advisor and later National Security Advisor to David Cameron. His NSA job gave him wide- ranging access to top-secret intelligence about the rise of IS in Syria Russian aggression and Iran’s nuclear programme. In 2016 as Sir Kim ­Darroch he landed the coveted post of UK ambassador to the US. But as the Darrochs approached their ruby wedding anniversary the ambassador was allegedly engaged in a special relationship of his own. The Sun understands he had begun his affair with Kosinski who is also married by the beginning of 2018. They swapped intimate messages seen by The Sun detailing plans for secret hook-ups. But as their relationship developed Kosinski’s scoops began to attract the attention of senior White House officials. The experienced reporter was far from a star name in the US media with Washington insiders describing her as “not well-connected”. Kosinski left her post at CNN five months after Lord Darroch resigned as the UK's US amassador. But sources say she suddenly began to steal a march on her rivals with the inside track on the Trump presidency’s most sensitive plans. In February 2018 Lord Darroch is understood to have been suspected of tipping off Kosinski that CIA Director Mike Pompeo had told his staff he would soon become Secretary of State. He was duly sworn into the job equivalent to Britain’s Foreign Secretary in April. Days later Kosinski allegedly learned Pompeo was secretly planning a hugely delicate trip to North Korea to lobby for the safe return of three US citizens. A source told The Sun: “It was believed that no one on the US side would leak this information. “It was critical for the American officials that this information did not get out. If it did the North Koreans could have been spooked and the three Americans may never have been returned.” No story ultimately ran. Pompeo’s trip went ahead in May and the US citizens were safely freed. But by now the White House was taking more than a keen interest in Kosinski’s work. In March 2018 Britain was rocked when ex-Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with deadly novichok near their home in Salisbury Wilts. The assassination attempt was quickly identified as the work of Russian hitmen and sparked global fury. The UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats. Other countries followed suit but the US was still carefully weighing up its options. BRITISH AMBASSADOR WHO CALLED TRUMP 'INEPT' HAS THERESA MAY'S 'FULL SUPPORT' Six days later Kosinski reported that America was thinking of also expelling Russian diplomats — but warned that it was seen internally as a drastic move. She later revealed “new and exclusive” details. Citing “a senior foreign diplomat” she claimed European allies were getting “optimistic signals”. Less than two weeks later Kosinski again raised eyebrows after apparently being tipped off about US plans for tough sanctions against Russia. Sources say the classified proposals had been discussed in private only with allies France Germany and the UK before they were formally announced on April 6. A former US official said: “Kosinski knew about these sanctions before they were announced.” With concerns growing Kosinski set off White House alarm bells for a fourth time after learning of a private spat between Trump and Nikki Haley at the time the US Ambassador to the UN. Sources say it was then that officials began seriously looking into Kosinski for evidence she was benefiting from leaks at the heart of Trump’s administration. Other posts by her revealed inside details of Mr Trump’s rare apology to ex-PM Theresa May after he gave an exclusive interview to The Sun saying she had “wrecked Brexit”. And then in a sensational twist sources say US authorities uncovered Kosinski’s affair with Lord Darroch. The relationship which security sources say left Lord Darroch open to the threat of blackmail by a hostile foreign power began to be examined in detail. In the end Lord Darroch was cleared by the probe. No action was formally taken against him but the fact that he was investigated will send shock waves through the diplomatic world. UK AMBASSADOR VOUCHED FOR 'LEGIT' DOSSIER AUTHOR SAID TRUMP KILLED IRAN DEAL TO SPITE OBAMA LEAKS SHOW After the diplomat’s cables were leaked President Trump told reporters: “The ambassador has not served the UK well.” He mysteriously added: “I can say things about him but I won’t bother.” A former senior US official said Mr Trump was referring to the investigation and knew of his affair with Kosinski. They added: “The President never holds back but out of respect to the UK he did on this occasion.” Days later Lord Darroch quit. Since then he has been ­ennobled and published his memoirs called Collateral ­Damage — a thinly veiled reference to his fall from grace. In his book he talks about his fury at the leaker of his diplomatic cables and how he wished he could meet them in “a prison visiting room”. , https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-us-ambassador-investigated-secrets-cnn-reporter,0.810327217706085
177,UK’s US ambassador investigated over fears he leaked White House secrets to CNN reporter," One of the people on an explosive email thread allegedly involving Hunter Biden has corroborated the veracity of the messages which appear to outline a payout for former Vice President Joe Biden as part of a deal with a Chinese energy firm. One email dated May 13 2017 and obtained by Fox News includes a discussion of “remuneration packages” for six people in a business deal with a Chinese energy firm. The email appeared to identify Hunter Biden as “Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC” in an apparent reference to now-bankrupt CEFC China Energy Co. The email includes a note that “Hunter has some office expectations he will elaborate.” A proposed equity split references “20” for “H” and “10 held by H for the big guy?” with no further details. Fox News spoke to one of the people who was copied on the email who confirmed its authenticity.

Another email from May of 2014 shows Vadym Pozharskyi an adviser to Burisma's board allegedly shows him asking for the younger Biden's advice on how to stop ""politically motivated actions."" “We urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence to convey a message / signal etc. to stop what we consider to be politically motivated actions"" it reads.

Politico later clarified that the campaign wouldn't rule out the possibility that the former vice president had an informal interaction with Pozharskyi. Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates also said: ""Investigations by the press during impeachment and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official U.S. policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing.

183,Family of Colorado man killed in pro-police rally seeks answer lawyer says, There has been a surge in the number of ballots returned in Colorado during the first week of early voting with more than 430000 votes cast according to the Secretary of State’s office. Colorado’s Secretary of State Jena Griswold took to Twitter to announce that the number of ballots cast has outstripped this period of time during the 2016 presidential election by a factor of 24. “Colorado is seeing record turnout” Griswold said Thursday. “As of yesterday over 300000 Coloradans have voted which is 24 times more than at this point in 2016.” COLORADO SEC. OF STATE DISPENSES PPE TO ELECTION WORKERS AMID RISING COVID CASES As of Friday that figure had increased by over 130000 votes totaling 436443 ballots received. Democrats have been quick to submit their ballots with more than 198000 votes cast while Republicans have submitted just over 87000 votes so far according to state records. Colorado has used universal mail-in voting since 2013 meaning the recent surge is not a result of increased requests by Coloradans for mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic as all registered voters receive a mail-in ballot automatically. But during the 2016 presidential race Colorado had only received 42416 returned ballots with 19 days left until the Nov. 3 election a spokesperson confirmed for Fox News Friday. Although Democrats still exceeded Republicans in the number of mail-in ballots submitted in 2016 the split was far closer with 18919 Democratic ballots returned and 12611 Republican ballots received by this time in the last presidential cycle. Colorado does allow election-day voting at polling stations on Nov. 3 but there will likely be less in-person voters than during previous years due to the pandemic.  A spokesperson with the Secretary of State’s office told Fox News that they had “record-breaking turnout” during the June primaries through their mail-in voting system. DENVER ORDERS NEW MASK MANDATE AMID SPIKING CASES A reported 99.3 percent of voters submitted their ballots through the mail for this year’s primaries and only .7 percent of Coloradans voted in person. President Trump has repeatedly claimed that mail-in voting will lead to voter fraud though election officials in Colorado rely on a signature verification program making a fraudulent ballot unlikely. If a ballot’s signature does not match the previous signature that the state has on record it will be flagged. But an unwanted result of the signature verification program is younger voters who have less signatures in the system for comparison so they are more likely to have their ballots flagged Griswold explained to Fox News. The secretary of state has launched a smartphone based solution to address this issue known as TXT2Cure which allows younger voters the ability to quickly address their ballots issues. “Overall our signature discrepancy rates are extremely low they’re the lowest in the nation but they are a lot higher for younger people” Griswold told Fox News.

This isn't the first time ABC landed in hot water over one of its town hall events. Last month The Washington Free Beacon reported that at least two of the so-called ""uncommitted voters"" who participated in its town hall with President Trump had engaged in liberal political activism or criticized the president on social media. One of them Kutztown University professor Ellesia Blaque -- who grilled President Trump on the subject of health care -- expressed her intention to volunteer for Kamala Harris' presidential campaign in a January 2019 tweet. In other tweets Blaque trashed the president as ""pathetic"" ""a f---ing moron"" a ""pig"" and a ""swine."" Meanwhile she identifies as a ""liberal Democrat"" on her Facebook page. The other was Philadelphia pastor Carl Day who was also labeled an ""uncommitted"" voter by ABC News but tweeted just last month that he had ""never once supported trump and won't now. What I will do is call them out of their foolery."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In another tweet Day referred to the Trump slogan ""Make America Great Again"" as a time when ""the n-----s did what they were told in all industries wouldn't have the audacity to try to enter a white [sic] establishment and didn't talk back to the cops."" Day also suggested that Trump is a ""villain.""

185,ABC silent after Biden town hall attendees identified as ex-Obama speechwriter wife of prominent Democrat," Russian YouTube star Yuri Dud's interview with the Navalnys last week was full of detail about what life is like for the family of Russia's most famous opposition figure and how it feels to be poisoned with Novichok.      But the interview has not reached everyone who may be interested as it is nearly two and a half hours long and in Russian.  In the interview Alexei Navalny recounts the moments before he succumbed to poisoning.  He had just wrapped up what he considered a successful shoot for a documentary on corruption in a couple of Siberian cities ahead of local elections. He was looking forward to relaxing on the plane for at least three hours during which nobody could bother him. He even planned a binge-watch of the animated sci-fi series Rick and Morty.  But first he did some shopping in the Tomsk airport for Siberian sweets to bring back to his kids. Navalny said being poisoned with Novichok isn't painful bit gives a horrible undefinable sensation as though you are going under and off to meet your maker. NAVALNY WAS POISONED WITH NOVICHOK GERMAN GOVERNMENT SAYS He has since credited his wife with getting him through this episode with a flowery Instagram post about what love is written shortly after he woke up from his long coma.   Yulia Navalnaya (Navalnaya is the feminine form of Navalny in Russian) was not only by his side throughout his coma but she orchestrated spiriting him out of Russia.  But before that she learned in the early hours of Aug. 20 that her husband had been poisoned. Navalny's wife of 20 years was used to getting bad news calls yet this one was different. She'd been preparing to pick him up at the airport when he returned from Siberia that morning.  Instead she found herself racing to airport to fly to Omsk where her husband's plane had made an emergency landing. ""The scariest thing"" Navalnaya told Yuri Dud ""was getting on a plane and knowing it's about a four-hour flight and for that time you will be blocked from getting any information.""   One of Navalny's associates Ivan Zhdanov flew with her and Navalnaya said though she is not a chatty person she talked to Zhdanov for the entire flight - possibly revealing all sorts of family secrets in the process because of her fear.   She said she watched Zhdanov's expression as he scrolled through his messages when they landed and let him convey any news. ALEXEI NAVALNY'S ANTI-CORRUPTION MESSAGE CONTINUES DESPITE POISONING IN VIDEOS RELEASED BY HIS FOUNDATION At the hospital ""it was horrible to see Alexei and understand that the situation was worse than I'd expected"" she said. ""And to see the fear of the doctors worried about what they are telling me.  I just kept thinking 'I have to get him out because they are not going to tell me the truth.'"" She thinks the combination of pressure from the West the press and the letter she wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin created the perfect storm to affect her husband's release.  She and Navalny in Dud's interview play off each other with shared trademark humor and irony about Yulia’s voyage with her husband in a box marked ""Biohazard.""   Jokes aside Dud asked her how she lives with a husband who is constantly under arrest threat and surveillance.  Does she ever ask him to give it a break?  ""Everyone always wants to hear me say that or hint at that but no I support what he does.  I sincerely say this.  It is not just pretty words."" Navalnaya said she would be disappointed if her husband stopped fighting to make Russia a better place. She studied international relations and worked at a bank after graduation but eventually gave up her career after marrying Navalny realizing his life would be intense and political. They have two children a pre-teen boy Zakhar and daughter Dasha who studies at Stanford University.  Navalnaya said they never really thought much about trying to get Dasha to a top school but ended up socializing with so many people who were prepping their own kids for greatness that they began to push their daughter.   Navalny said they didn't aim to send her abroad but just wanted the best for her.  She could have wound up in Hong Kong or even Tomsk but he said unfortunately Russia's institutes of higher learning don't rank in the top echelon worldwide.   Dasha Navalnaya is on a scholarship and her parents said they pay her board. Navalny makes a salary of about $70000 from a businessman named Boris Zimin who lives outside Russia and who pays him for legal services. Navalny is a trained lawyer.   But he said in large part Zimin is supporting his activism no strings attached and also footed the bill for the flight to Germany for treatment.  Navalny insists that at least he is transparent and he will continue to be.   He has to pay the medical bill in Germany but does not have the money.  Russia has frozen his accounts and he vows to be entirely forthcoming about who steps up to help him pay back Charite hospital.  ""Do you know where Putin's wealth comes from?  He won't even confirm what the names of his daughters are"" Navalny adds. Navalnaya shares her husband’s views and he even suggests she may be more radical perhaps because she has watched treatment he endured at the hands of the state.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Navalnaya like her husband is eager to return to Russia.  ""I am not afraid to return to Russia"" she told Dud. ""We absolutely will return to Russia.  The only thing I told Alexei is to get completely cured first. We don't know what awaits us in Russia.  If you are not completely cured it's possible the next time you won't be saved.""

186,Being Navalny: Russian activist wife explain his brush with death after poisoning escaping for treatment," Facebook is reinstating advertising it previously blocked from an anti-abortion organization claiming that former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris D-Calif. supported abortion up until the moment of birth. ""We’re working to reinstate the ads"" Facebook's Devon Kearns told Fox News in an email Friday. The social media giant had blocked the ad after The Dispatch a conservative outlet run by former National Review editor Jonah Goldberg issued a fact check that was later retracted on the ad. On Friday the Susan B. Anthony List tweeted a screenshot of Facebook explaining that one of the group's ads which ran in key battleground states had been ""debunked"" and therefore couldn't run on the platform. BIG TECH CEOS CALLED TO TESTIFY WEDNESDAY BEFORE SENATE AMID CENSORSHIP UPROAR ""Ads must not include claims debunked by a third-party fact-checkers or in certain circumstances claims debunked by organizations with particular expertise"" the message read. The email titled ""Ad Can't Run: Update Ad"" suggested that SBA List could ""issue a correction"" or dispute the ban by reaching out to the third-party fact-checker rather than Facebook itself. In addition to blocking the ads Facebook also placed a ""partly false"" warning label on a link to the ad. Amid backlash The Dispatch issued a ""mea culpa"" on Friday in which it retracted the fact-check and Facebook eventually removed the ""partly false"" label from the post. Regardless the issue reignited concerns about social media bias. Sen. Josh Hawley R-Mo. sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing what he called ""an increasingly troubling pattern: it has become abundantly clear that Facebook is targeting voices that dissent from the national media's progressive consensus."" SBA List's complaint came after Facebook and Twitter faced intense backlash for the way they censored a New York Post article on emails from a Burisma adviser to Hunter Biden and his former business partner. Conservatives like SBA List President Marjorie Danenfelser who also leads the Trump campaign's ""Pro-Life Voices for Trump"" have similarly claimed that tech companies have a habit of suppressing conservative viewpoints. Next Wednesday the Senate is expected to hold a hearing on the issue with the Commerce Committee inviting leaders of Facebook Twitter and Google to testify. Each have denied political bias. FACT-CHECKING GURU BLASTS TWITTER FACEBOOK AS DANGEROUS 'ARBITERS OF TRUTH' AFTER CENSORING BIDEN ARTICLE The initial fact-check argued that Biden and Harris hadn't explicitly supported late-term abortion. In The Dispatch's update co-founder Steve Hayes said the fact-check was published in error and in draft form before final edits and internal fact-checking were completed. ""As a result the viral post was assigned a 'partly false' rating that we have determined is not justified after completing The Dispatch fact-checking process"" Hayes said. In August a Snopes fact-check similarly said Harris hadn't explicitly stated that she supports the termination of a pregnancy at any time just before birth."" But anti-abortion advocates like Alexandra DeSanctis a staff writer at National Review stay hey don't have to be explicit since their policy stances allow for late-term abortions to take place. CALIFORNIA AG PLEDGES NOT TO PROSECUTE WOMEN FOR ABORTION IF ROE V. WADE IS OVERTURNED Both DeSanctis and SBA List spokesperson Mallory Quigley pointed to the Democratic nominee's support for codifying Roe v. Wade a move that many states and Democratic presidential candidates endorsed amid a raft of anti-abortion laws. Vice President Mike Pence made a similar claim about late-term abortion during his debate with Harris asserting that Biden supported repealing the Hyde Amendment which would allow taxpayer funds for abortions up until birth. While Roe legalized abortion early in a pregnancy it left open exceptions for life and health of the mother at later gestational ages.   The decision in Doe v. Bolton released on the same day in 1973 as Roe v. Wade argued that life and health of the mother encompassed a wide range of reasons.  In his majority opinion former Justice Harry Blackmun wrote that ""medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors--physical emotional psychological familial and the woman's age--relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health."" The Guttmacher Institute which promotes abortion access and studies the issue analyzed survey data of 272 women who underwent an abortion after 20 weeks of gestation. It concluded in 2013 that ""[m]ost women seeking later abortion fit at least one of five profiles: They were raising children alone were depressed or using illicit substances were in conflict with a male partner or experiencing domestic violence had trouble deciding and then had access problems or were young and nulliparous."" BARRETT SAYS ROE V. WADE IS NOT A 'SUPER PRECEDENT' THAT CANNOT BE OVERTURNED The Democratic Party has also faced internal pushback for its position on abortion restrictions. It specifically supports codifying Roe v. Wade and opposes ""laws that create barriers to women’s reproductive health and rights."" In criticizing Trump's comments on late-term abortion The Washington Post previously cited a Northwestern University professor who said ""'abortion until the moment of birth' doesn't exist."" ""[I]t’s a boogeyman abortion opponents have created to frighten voters and derail rational conversation about constitutional rights” said Katie L. Watson a professor at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine. “Nobody ‘supports’ it and nobody does it. No patient ever asks a physician to end her pregnancy ‘the moment before birth’ and no physician would agree to do it.” While it's unclear when each abortion occurs the Centers for Disease Control has reported that at least 143 babies died between 2003-2014 in cases involving induced termination. The agency noted that could be an underestimate. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Additional reporting and statements have raised questions about infants born alive after abortion attempts. For example the Center for Medical Progress promoted videos in July showing a Planned Parenthood executive admitting in a deposition that his affiliate in California saw an infant born alive and then die ""seconds"" after the child left the mother's womb. Dr. Deborah Nucatola the medical director who infamously discussed ""crush[ing]"" fetuses in a way that would yield intact tissue also said she was ""sure"" she'd seen nonviable fetuses exit the uterus. By nonviable she meant ""not capable of survival."" It's unclear when those abortions occurred as Planned Parenthood has performed them at various gestational ages while obtaining fetal tissue. State health data has also shown that dozens of babies -- at least 40 -- were born alive after botched abortions in three states since 2016. Fox News' Fred Lucas contributed to this report.

If you flipped the channel during our show Thursday night you may have seen the president and his challenger making their respective cases to voters. But President Trump and Joe Biden weren't debating each other. That would have been too risky. There's a massive public health crisis underway you may have heard. So to avoid what doomsday hobbyists on Twitter like to call a ""superspreader event"" Trump and Biden held separate indoor town halls surrounded by people. They talked to partisan moderators instead of each other. That might seem like a loss to the country three weeks before a presidential election. But unfortunately the science on this question is clear: Nothing could be more dangerous to America than a televised in-person debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. So the so-called debate commission made certain a debate couldn't happen. Who benefitted from that decision? Well not voters. America has held regularly scheduled presidential debates for decades and we have them for a reason. The more information voters can get directly from the candidates rather than the media the better our democracy functions not that anyone's interested in democracy anymore. Joe Biden doesn't care either way. He just didn't want to talk about Burisma.

We're not speculating. The laptop in question is real. It belonged to Hunter Biden. So there is no excuse for not asking about it.  But they didn't ask about it. It was a cover-up in real time. No matter what happens in the election next month the American media will never be the same after this. It cannot continue this way. It is too dishonest. Nevertheless we did learn a few things Thursday night. (It's hard not to learn when you watch Joe Biden try to speak for 90 minutes.) At one point an activist told Joe Biden that she has an eight-year-old transgender daughter. She asked Joe Biden what he thought about that. Here's how he responded: ABC SILENT AFTER BIDEN TOWN HALL ATTENDEES IDENTIFIED AS EX-OBAMA SPEECHWRITER WIFE OF PROMINENT DEMOCRAT BIDEN: The idea that an eight-year-old child or a 10-year-old child decides 'You know I've decided I want to be transgender. That's what I think. I'd like to be a -- make my life a lot easier.' There should be zero discrimination. What's happening is too many transgender women of color are being murdered. They're being murdered. I mean I think it's up to now 17 don't hold me to that number. So if an eight-year-old biological boy decides one day that he's really a girl that's final and you'd have to be a bigot to pause and say ""Wait a minute you're eight years old you're a small child. Maybe let's think about this for a minute."" That's what a normal person who has kids would say. People with kids know that children grow and change. They change their minds about a lot of things including themselves. That's the reality of it. But if you're a crazed ideologue you don't care about reality. So you would tell the rest of us that an eight-year-old is entitled to hormone therapy on demand and permanent life-altering surgery. That's what Biden is telling us. It doesn't matter how fashionable talk like this is right now and it is very fashionable it is crazy and it's destructive and it's having a profound effect. No one wants to say it but it's true. We know that between 2016 and 2017 the number of gender surgeries for biological females in this country quadrupled. We also know that many people who get those surgeries regret them later deeply regret them. We'd have a lot more data on that but universities are actively punishing researchers who follow that line of inquiry. So much for science. In the end mania like this will end. The left is at war with nature. Inevitably they will lose that war because nature always prevails. But in the meantime many children are being hurt irreparably. Biden doesn't care. It's the new thing and so he's for it. In fact Biden is now busy rewriting his entire life story to pretend that he has been woke for 60 years. Thursday night he told us he became a gay rights supporter during the Kennedy administration sometime around 1962 when he and his father saw two gay men kissing.  BIDEN FALSELY CLAIMS UNION ENDORSEMENT DURING ABC TOWN HALL When asked about police brutality the former vice president speculated that maybe people like George Floyd would be alive today if the police had just shot him in the leg a few times. BIDEN: There's a lot of things we've learned and it takes time. But we can do this. You can ban chokeholds ... But beyond that you have to teach people how to deescalate circumstances deescalate. So instead of anybody coming at you and the first thing you do shoot to kill shoot him in the leg.  How much would you have to know about firearms or human biology to wonder if maybe there could be some unintended consequences there? People do have arteries in their legs after all and sometimes bullets do miss their targets. So why did no one point out how demented Biden's answer was? Well we have some clarity on the question of why no one pointed it out. It turns out George Stephanopoulos the moderator of last night's ABC town hall was not the only political operative in the room. One supposedly uncommitted voter was in fact a former Obama administration speechwriter called Nathan Osburn. Osburn repeated Biden campaign talking points to the letter at one point referring to court-packing as a safeguard ""that'll help ensure more long-term balance and stability"" on the Supreme Court. BIDEN ANSWERES QUESTIONS ON COURT-PACKING VACCINE MANDATE AT ABC TOWN HALL WITH 'IT DEPENDS' BIDEN: I have not been a fan of court-packing because I think it just generates what will happen ... Whoever wins it just keeps moving in a way that is inconsistent with what is going to be manageable. STEPHANOPOULOS: So you're still not a fan? BIDEN: Well I'm not a fan ... It depends on how this turns out not how he wins but how it's handled how it's handled. But there's a number of things that are going to be coming up and there's going to be a lot of discussion about other alternatives as well. So we did learn something new last night: Joe Biden isn't a fan of court-packing. Court-packing has had a few off years and Joe Biden started to lose his faith in it even sold his ""Court-Packing"" jersey. But at the end of the day Joe Biden is still open to court-packing and can get back on the court-packing bandwagon depending on how things are ""handled."" Got it?  Biden was allowed to answer non-questions like this because he was surrounded by sycophants and former employees of his party. Over at NBC by contrast the sitting president didn't have that luxury to put it mildly. (By the way it's not good for you to be sucked up to too much. It's good to get smacked around a little bit. It makes you sharper.) TRUMP SAYS HE KNOWS 'NOTHING' ABOUT QANON WHEN PRESSED BY SAVANNAH GUTHRIE During the president's one-hour event moderator Savannah Guthrie asked him dozens more questions than the voters in the room got to ask. And when Trump began speaking Guthrie interrupted him over and over again. Joe Biden wasn't there so the moderator played stand-in for Joe Biden. The good news about all of this is it's so bad and so transparent that it can't continue. All their stupid little morning shows and their dumb Sunday shows and their even dumber cable shows -- all of that's going away when the smoke clears from this election. There will be a massive realignment in the media no matter who wins because they've showed who they are and it's so unappealing so far from journalism that it can't continue.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile back on ABC Joe Biden skated on answering any questions of substance about his son or Antifa or BLM. On NBC Guthrie pushed Donald Trump to condemn QAnon and White supremacy and he did it dutifully. But it wasn't enough. The point of demanding performative disavowals isn't to get the disavowal it's to smear the person you're asking to disavow the group by association with the group. GUTHRIE: You were asked point-blank to denounce White supremacy [at the first debate]. In the moment you didn't ... A couple of days later on a different show you denounce White supremacy -- TRUMP: You always do this. You've done this line -- I denounce White supremacy OK?  GUTHRIE: You did two days later. TRUMP: I've denounced White supremacy for years. But you always do you always start off with the question. You didn't ask Joe Biden whether or not he denounces Antifa ...  Are you listening? I denounce White supremacy. What's your next question? NBC was under a lot of pressure from Democrats to make Thursday night's town hall look like this and just like Facebook and Twitter delivered earlier this week NBC delivered too.

Many members of the D.C. media establishment initially came to Scully's defense including former White House press secretary-turned-CNN analyst Joe Lockhart who tweeted Oct. 9 that ""if Steve Scully says [he was hacked] you can take it to the bank [and] anyone who questions him or makes accusations is a damn liar."" ""Now we know this week who the damn liar was"" remarked Ingraham who called Lockhart's tweet the ""piece de resistance"" of Scully defenses in the Biden-friendly media.

208,Navy CPO dead after forklift accident at Norfolk Naval Station," Amazon’s Echo line is the reigning champ of the smart speaker world. Compared to virtual assistants like Google and Siri Alexa works with far more gadgets and responds to significantly more commands than the competition. Plus Echo devices are pretty inexpensive starting around $25 for the Flex and $30 for the Dot when you catch it on sale.  I bought six of these Echo Shows for Christmas presents. They have a nice screen so all the kids and grandkids can pop in and say hello to my Mom whenever they want. She’s going to love it. Maybe you’re new to Alexa and all she can do or you need some new ideas to bring new life to your smart speaker. Here are 20 ways she can make your life easier — or just make you and the family laugh. First let’s talk security Never keep any smart device that hears what you say in private places like your bedroom or bathroom. If you're working from home keep it out of your office space too — or switch off the speaker during work hours. You don't want to risk anyone or anything overhearing confidential info. You need to adjust a few privacy settings too. With a few taps you can instruct Alexa to delete your records and disable voice purchases automatically. Tap or click here for all the steps. Now onto the fun stuff! 1. “Alexa call (contact)” or “Alexa call (number).” Alexa recognizes names and spoken numbers and can make calls for you. To make this work first register your contacts in the Alexa app. On your smartphone open the app and follow these steps: Once your contacts are registered ask Alexa to place the call for you. Note: There are certain numbers Alexa can’t call including 911 toll-free numbers or international numbers outside the U.S. Mexico or Canada. 2. “Alexa move my 8 a.m. meeting today to 1 p.m.” or “Alexa cancel my 10 a.m. call.” Alexa can act as your personal assistant if you sync your calendar. She can remind you about your upcoming meetings or even move cancel or schedule one for you. Here’s how to sync calendars from iCloud Outlook Google and other services: 3. “Alexa drop in on all devices.” Remember those clunky old intercom systems in big homes? Alexa is the modern equivalent. To use it just say “Alexa drop in on all devices” to reach every Alexa-enabled speaker or “Alexa drop in on (device name)” to target just one. Then just wait for the confirmation tone before speaking. You can call the entire family for dinner without ever leaving the kitchen. Handy! PRIME PERKS: Amazon Prime is a lot more than free shipping. Tap or click here for some of my favorite perks and to get your free trial. 4. “Alexa remember …” Alexa can remember specific dates and events for you. Say ""Alexa remember …"" followed by whatever you'd like her to track. For example “Alexa remember I have a dentist appointment at 1 p.m. on Tuesday” or “Alexa remember I hid the key in the kitchen cupboard.” 5. “Alexa set volume to (number between 1 and 10)” Echo speakers have volume buttons on the top to adjust audio levels but you don't have to get up and walk over to your speaker to change it. Just tell Alexa what volume level you want. Try experimenting around with different levels to see which one you like best. You can also ask Alexa to “set volume to 11” which maxes the volume. It’s a sneaky reference to a classic movie. 6. “Alexa what’s the extended forecast?” This command will show you the extended forecast for the next seven days. I bet you’ll use this one all the time. 7. “Alexa tell me about the movie (title).” Alexa is an excellent resource for trivia and pop culture.

But now there’s another natural way to restore your cortisol levels: cow-hugging. People in several parts of the world have begun to embrace the alleged wellness trend which reportedly originated in the Netherlands where it is known as “koe knuffelen.” According to the BBC the practice of cuddling cows is supposed to reduce stress in humans by releasing the bonding hormone oxytocin. Cows are chosen specifically for their warm body temperatures and calm demeanor the outlet reported. VIDEOS AND PHOTOS OF 'CUTE' ANIMALS CAN REDUCE STRESS STUDY CLAIMS ""Cows are very relaxed animals they don’t fight they don’t get in trouble"" a farm owner who promotes the practice told BBC. ""You come to the fields and we have some special hugging cows and you can lay next to [them] — people think it's very relaxing."" PET OWNER DRILLS HOLES IN FENCE SO 2 DOGS CAN SEE THROUGH Farms in the United States and Switzerland have also adopted the wellness fad which according to a 2007 study in the Applied Animal Behavior Science journal also benefits the cows. The researchers found when the animals are rubbed massaged or pet they experience relaxation and pleasure as well. ""This suggests that cows may in part perceive human stroking of body regions often-licked similarly to social licking"" the researchers write in their study.

Katie Hill is launching a podcast called “Naked Politics.” “This podcast is where we can get dirty” the California Democrat said in a statement according to The Hill. “It’s where we can expose the naked truth behind what goes on. The backroom deals the monied interests the inability to break from the party. This podcast is here to expose what’s wrong in politics today undressing the issues and how we can fix them.” Hill -- who represented the state's 25th Congressional District north of Los Angeles -- resigned last October after naked pictures of her and a female campaign staffer were leaked to the media and days after an ethics investigation began in the House over whether she had an inappropriate relationship with a staffer in her office. REP. KATIE HILL RESIGNS AMID ETHICS PROBE INTO REPORTED AFFAIR WITH STAFFER  She acknowledged she had a romantic relationship with the campaign staffer before she took office but denied a relationship as a congresswoman. She also pushed back against allegations that she was involved in a “throuple” relationship with the staffer and her then-husband. When she announced her resignation she accused her husband of “revenge porn” over the photos being released to the media. KATIE HILL SAYS OLD GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT WAS 'HACKED' AFTER FORMER STAFF RIPS HER AS #METOO 'PERPETRATOR'  “This is what needs to happen so that the good people who supported me will no longer be subjected to the pain inflicted by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives who seem to happily provide a platform to a monster who is driving a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation” Hill said last year when announcing her resignation.

212,Katie Hill launching 'Naked Politics' podcast year after nude photo scandal," First lady Melania Trump called out former friend and adviser Stephanie Winston Wolkoff on Friday as “dishonest” and ""self-serving” weeks after Wolkoff released a tell-all book about their friendship. “Major news outlets eagerly covered salacious claims made by a former contractor who advised my office” Trump said in a White House essay without referring to Wolkoff by name. “A person who said she 'made me' even though she hardly knew me and someone who clung to me after my husband won the Presidency."" Trump said conversations Wolkoff secretly taped and shared with the media were taken “out of context” and the book ""Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady"" was filled with “idle gossip” meant to “distort” her character.  The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Wolkoff on Tuesday alleging the author breached a nondisclosure agreement and did not provide a draft copy of the book to the government for review. GOVERNMENT SUES MELANIA TRUMP'S FORMER BEST FRIEND OVER 'SCATHING'TELL-ALL The government claims Wolkoff “promised to maintain strict confidentiality over ‘nonpublic privileged and/or confidential information’” when she volunteered to serve as an adviser to the first lady in 2017. That nondisclosure agreement is said to have had no termination date. By failing to submit a draft of her book for review lawyers from the Justice Department claim she failed to obtain required authorization to divulge details included in the book which they note has been referred to as a “scathing tell-all.” The book is filled with unflattering allegations against the first lady including that she renovated a White House bathroom to avoid using the same facilities as former first lady Michelle Obama that she complained about having to decorate the White House for Christmas and appeared to be dismissive of children being separated at the U.S.-Mexico border after their parents crossed illegally. BILLY RAY CYRUS SENDS WELL WISHES TO MELANIA TRUMP THANKS HER FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION WORK  “Her ‘memoir’” Trump wrote “included blaming me for her ailing health from an accident she had long ago and for bad news coverage that she brought upon herself and others. Never once looking within at her own dishonest behavior and all in an attempt to be relevant. These kinds of people only care about their personal agenda — not about helping others.” Trump said news outlets chose to cover “pettiness” rather than her “positive work"" a reference to her Be Best campaign for children.  “There are plenty of opportunists out there who only care about themselves and unfortunately seek to self-aggrandize by knowingly taking advantage of my goodwill” she wrote.

214,Kayleigh McEnany 'blessed' to be clear of coronavirus posts photo with daughter Blake, In 2016 President Trump promised to drain the swamp. Little did he know how tough that would be. The swamp is protected by the liberal media Hollywood the Justice Department much of corporate America academia and now – most threatening of all – social media. The same social media that is working overtime to elect Joe Biden president. It isn’t just that Twitter and Facebook tried to squash a blockbuster New York Post story that could destroy Joe Biden’s campaign; it is that they were so brazen about it. Both companies shamelessly blocked the spread of a Post story purporting to show that Joe Biden knew about his son Hunter Biden’s questionable activities in Ukraine and China and that he lied about it. Twitter and Facebook had no excuse; they simply didn’t want Uncle Joe’s image tainted because they want him elected president. JONATHAN TURLEY: HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP AND THE FACEBOOK TWITTER CENSORSHIP SCANDAL – WATCH THESE 3 THINGSThey know that a slim majority (52%) of Americans think Biden is honest. He earns that reputation not by telling the truth but because when he lies about his family his educational record about co-sponsoring the Endangered Species Act or about engaging in the civil rights movement as he has done on numerous occasions the liberal media ignores it. The media also knows that Trump has failed to dent Biden’s “good guy” image in this campaign; that could change if the president can show that the former V.P. Obama’s point person on Ukraine and China assisted his son’s efforts to cash in on his White House office. The behavior of our social media giants is an outrage and also frustrating. After all where did we vent our anger about the suppression of the Post story? On Twitter and Facebook.   There really is no alternative which is why they can manufacture absurd arguments to justify their misdeeds content that it will not dent their business model or cost them money. Make no mistake at the end it is all about money. ADRIANA COHEN: FACEBOOK TWITTER'S THUGGISH CENSORSHIP AND ELECTION INTERFERENCE MEAN NO CITIZEN IS SAFE Democrats in Congress threaten to rein in the monopoly power of Facebook and Twitter responding perhaps to polls like the recent one from Pew which showed that 72% of American adults think social media companies have “too much power and influence in our politics.”  But they don’t mean it. Democrats want to make sure the social media giants continue to fatten their campaign chests and they will. In this cycle over 90% of Twitter and Facebook’s campaign contributions have gone to Joe Biden’s party.  Somehow they must be held accountable for their dishonesty and for filtering the news as they see fit. But that’s where the brazenness comes in. The social media firms know that virtually every institution in our country is stacked against President Trump. That includes the liberal mainstream media for sure. They didn’t even bother to carry the Ukraine story until it became a row about censorship on the social platforms. Google “New York Times Hunter Biden Ukraine” and you’ll find but one piece headlined: “Allegation on Biden Prompts Pushback From Social Media Companies” published October 14 the day after the Post broke the story. The Times’ reporting downplays the sordid details of the emails in which a corrupt oligarch thanks Hunter Biden for the introduction to his father Joe; the piece mostly chronicles the shutdown by Twitter and Facebook which they imply confirms the dubious nature of the story.  That was also the response from the Biden campaign.   Many have written that the excuses lofted by Twitter and Facebook don’t hold up especially when matched against the bogus anti-Trump stories allowed to roam free across the Internet. Many stories connected to the RussiaGate probe repeated breathlessly on CNN and MSNBC and spread enthusiastically on Twitter and Facebook proved entirely false. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER For instance at the end of 2017 CNN claimed that Donald Trump Jr. was offered access to the blockbuster DNC and Podesta emails ultimately published by WikiLeaks before those communications went public. This was a big big deal at the time purporting to show that the Trump campaign had indeed conspired with Russian disinformation agents.  Except like many similar big “reveals” it turned out to be utterly fake. There are dozens of such scantily-researched stories that have been widely disseminated as long as they cast Trump or his associates in a poor light. It isn’t just the media. The computer containing the compromising emails was first sent to the FBI last December. Someone needs to explain why the FBI never followed up especially since Senate Republicans held hearings about Hunter and Joe Biden’s activities in Ukraine. Wouldn’t this laptop be significant to those investigations? Misbehavior at the FBI figures prominently in the center of many controversies including dropping an investigation into possible influence peddling by Hillary Clinton enabled by her foundation the dishonest set-up of General Michael Flynn the lying to the FISA court and most recently according to CNN in a three-year quest to determine if Trump received campaign funds illicitly from an Egyptian state-owned bank.  Three years of pursuing a possible crime committed by the president which was ultimately abandoned and shut down this past summer. They found nothing just as Robert Mueller found nothing.   What other politically-motivated investigations of President Trump are underway? Who is authorizing these wasteful political efforts?   Our country is in danger and I do not say that lightly. If only one point of view is allowed if the media suppresses contrary opinion we are in trouble. It is astonishing that as of Friday afternoon seemingly no employees at any major liberal news outlet have stepped up to defend freedom of speech and a free press. When the New York Times’ token Republican never-Trumper Bret Stephens recently criticized the paper’s discredited 1619 Project the Times’ union blew up in outrage and demanded he be shut down. Yes -- journalists wanting to suppress journalists.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And yet they complain when President Trump rails against Fake News.

215,Liz Peek: Facebook Twitter's censorship brazenly protects Biden -- endangers our democracy, Anyone who still doubts that the elite media is out to destroy President Trump should watch his NBC town hall from Thursday night.  Savannah Guthrie who moderated the event in Miami was so hostile and irritating it was really unbearable to watch her at times. She didn’t even pretend to be an objective journalist.  In stark contrast President Trump was so calm steady and positive. It was one of his best performances. Indeed he was presidential not just a candidate seeking office. And despite — or perhaps because of — Guthrie’s almost maniacal hostility President Trump’s composure should be encouraging to all Republicans and conservatives.  In other words it was President Trump at his best — defending his indisputably strong record and agenda in a considered controlled way. He just needs to keep it up.  DAN GAINOR: TRUMP’S NBC TOWN HALL TURNS INTO DEBATE WITH MODERATOR — AND TRUMP WINS What makes the president’s composure so striking is that he had the perfect excuse to get into a slugfest with Guthrie who was on the attack the entire night.  A town hall is supposed to be an event where voters ask questions. The moderator should just keep things running smoothly. That’s because unlike a debate a town hall provides the people the opportunity to engage candidates directly.   Guthrie however took the first several minutes to fire questions at President Trump -- essentially creating a mini-debate with the president. CRITICS PAN NBC TOWN HALL SAVANNAH GUTHRIE FOR 'DEBATING' TRUMP ABC FOR GIVING 'SOFTBALLS' TO BIDEN Compare this to Joe Biden’s ABC town hall on the same night during which moderator George Stephanopoulos went straight to questions from voters. No aggression. No attempts at “gotcha journalism.”  The difference had nothing to do with the moderators or the networks and everything to do with the candidates. I doubt Guthrie would have badgered Biden from the start.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Still President Trump looked much better than he did during the first debate. His interaction with the audience was great. Those who watched the event may recall the three women sitting behind the president on camera the whole time nodding in approval of what he was saying virtually the entire evening. If we didn’t know better that it was an NBC event it seemed like they were put there intentionally to make the president look good. But really his remarks were just resonating.  President Trump answered questions and reassured people on several important subjects including that we are witnessing a strong V-shaped economic recovery following the lockdowns induced by the coronavirus. Plus President Trump defended his wise response to the pandemic — a response that actually saved two million lives by taking early actions such as stopping travel from China. (Remember Biden demonized the president’s decision to cut off travel from China as “xenophobic.”)  President Trump looked presidential on Thursday night and he should keep it up during next week’s debate – and through the rest of the election. His job is not to entertain but to govern. And he has done a great job of governing the country with effective policies. He should focus on this and not get pulled off course by an embittered hostile media.  To read hear and watch more of Newt’s commentary visit Gingrich360.com.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH , https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-guthrie-nbc-town-hall-newt-gingrich,0.8103314283926762
216,Newt Gingrich: Trump's composure vs. Guthrie's almost maniacal hostility at NBC's Town Hall tells us this, A New Jersey man was busted in Connecticut on trespassing and burglary charges less than an hour after being released from custody for a drug and larceny arrest police said. Lawrence Crook 37 of Jersey City was first arrested in Fairfield on Oct. 8 on charges of first-degree larceny possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia after a man at a condo complex told cops he saw Crook with a black SUV acting suspiciously police told the Fairfield Citizen. “He was seen loading several blue and white striped bags into the vehicle” Fairfield police Lt. Antonio Granata told the newspaper. “When he was confronted by a witness a brief conversation ensued and the male quickly fled on foot which prompted a call to police.” Investigators learned the SUV had been reported stolen from a car dealership in Bayside Queens and tracked down a suspect who was later identified as Crook police said. OFF-DUTY NEW JERSEY COP ACCUSED OF LEADING POLICE ON HIGH-SPEED CHASE “Officers later confirmed it to be the same suspect through surveillance video a police K-9 track witness identification and suspect admission” Granata told the newspaper. The blue and white bags police said Crook loaded into the stolen SUV were laundry bags from a nearby hotel. He was also found in possession of suspected methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia Granata told the newspaper. Crook was taken into custody and later released after posting a $300 bond. He also signed a promise to return to Bridgeport Superior Court on Oct. 29 Granata said. But Crook came into contact with authorities for a second time that day less than an hour later after being released from custody when he was spotted lurking inside the Fairfield Fire Department’s headquarters police said. A lieutenant inside the building allegedly saw Crook walking around the facility before ransacking a fireman’s property. He was then arrested on charges of third-degree burglary and first-degree criminal trespass after cops responded to the headquarters on Reef Road Granata said.

217,NJ man arrested less than an hour after being released on earlier bust, Iran announced Saturday that its death toll from the coronavirus has passed the milestone of 30000 killed in what has been the Mideast region's worst outbreak. The announcement by Health Ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari saw Iran put its total death toll from the outbreak at 30123 killed with 253 new deaths being added to the official count. Lari added that there are 4721 virus patients that are in critical condition. Iran has been struggling with the coronavirus since announcing its first cases in February with more than 526000 confirmed cases to date. In recent weeks Iran has seen daily death tolls spike to their highest-ever levels sparking increasing concern even as government officials continue to resist a total lockdown for fear of cratering the economy which has been hard-hit by U.S. sanctions. On Wednesday Iranian officials announced a travel ban to and from five major cities including the capital of Tehran and the holy city of Mashhad that they said aimed to contain the virus' spread. The coronavirus has also spread to some of the highest levels of Iran's government which includes many older men. Among those recently infected is the head of the country's atomic energy organization while Iran's vice president in charge of budget and planning tested positive on Sunday. HEALTHY YOUNG PEOPLE MAY WAIT FOR CORONAVIRUS VACCINE UNTIL 2022 WHO OFFICIAL SAYS After downplaying the outbreak in its first weeks Iranian officials have more recently begun to admit the scope of the epidemic within the country. Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi who had tested positive for the virus in March after playing down its threat and refuting reports of mass deaths told state TV on Wednesday that the country's true death toll is about double the reported figures. According to officials there are also large numbers of patients in hospitals being treated as COVID-19 cases but who have not been tested whose tests came out as false negatives or whose symptoms are not the same as those listed by the World Health Organization and who are therefore not counted in the official case numbers. Like in many other countries the spiraling outbreak in Iran reflects the government's contradictory virus response. This week as the daily recorded death toll hit the record for three times authorities announced tighter restrictions for the hard-hit capital of Tehran. Recently reopened universities and schools as well as libraries mosques cinemas museums and beauty salons shut down. In the past week the government mandated that all Tehran residents wear face masks outdoors and in public places warning violators would be fined. Officials promised those who tested positive would be closely tracked. Movement restrictions this spring somewhat checked the spread of the disease. Then the government swiftly reopened the country desperate to boost its stricken economy. Since June the case count has steadily increased — and spiked to new heights in recent weeks. FAUCI CALLS CORONAVIRUS HERD IMMUNITY APPROACH 'NONSENSE VERY DANGEROUS' Long before the virus hit Iran's economy was ailing pummeled by U.S. sanctions after the Trump administration's unilateral withdrawal in 2018 from Tehran's nuclear accord with world powers. As the death toll soared this week the nation's currency plunged to its lowest level ever following the U.S. administration's decision last week to blacklist Iranian banks that had so far escaped the bulk of re-imposed American sanctions. As Iran approaches winter the seasonal influenza could be an added and serious issue for the country as it has had purchasing the flu vaccine amid new American sanctions on Iranian banks. Iran's Red Crescent Society said in a tweet on Tuesday that they were in charge of importing two million flu vaccine doses into the country but that new U.S. sanctions prevented the import. Meanwhile on Saturday the United Arab Emirates has announced its highest single-day total of new cases of the coronavirus amid a spike in the Gulf nation that is home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The country's Health Ministry said tests found 1538 new cases of the virus pushing the overall number of cases to 114387. The ministry said another four people died from the virus pushing the overall death toll to 459. Overall recoveries are at 106354. Recorded infections have soared again in recent weeks as authorities have relaxed restrictions and resumed schools for in-person instruction. Dubai has reopened its airport for international travelers and embarked on an active campaign promoting itself as a tourism destination amid the pandemic. The UAE is engaged in an aggressive testing campaign with over 11 million tests conducted in a country home to over 9 million people. , https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-30000-killed,0.8102347845466762
218,Iran announces its virus death toll passes 30000 killed," The New York Police Department – said to be the largest police force in the nation – is in the grip of a ""troubling"" shakeup as retirements and resignations continue to mount officials said. Union officials and others say the exodus is being fueled in part by pressure by racial justice advocates to defund police departments or impose major reforms. The NYPD said in an email to Fox News this week that 2385 officers have submitted their retirement papers this year as of Oct. 6 – an 87% increase from the 1274 retirements reported during the same period in 2019. The department said 372 others have resigned as of Oct. 6 five more than last year.

NYPD'S CHIEF OF PATROL FAUSTO PICHARDO RESIGNS OVER RIFT WITH DE BLASIO Pichardo the NYPD’s first Dominican chief of patrol filed for retirement Tuesday after more than two decades on the job. He has held the position since Dec. 5 2019. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea lauded Pichardo 43 for his service at the helm of the Patrol Services Bureau telling local affiliate FOX 5 that the department is also losing “a friend and a member of our blue family.” “Fausto when I tabbed him last year to be the chief of patrol I never hesitated for a second and I never regretted the decision for a second” Shea said calling him a “consummate professional.” “Probably one of the most well-rounded individuals that we have. The total package. [A] huge loss and I wish him the best of luck.” Shea previously told PIX 11 that ""putting it mildly ... I was surprised that he’s leaving.” In his own announcement Wednesday Pichardo thanked Shea and Mayor Bill de Blasio for “always trusting and supporting” him. But sources first told the New York Post and later confirmed to Fox News that Pichardo’s decision to retire was spurred in part by de Blasio’s micromanaging. “I think he knew better to call Shea and beat him up so ... he called Pichardo instead and he had enough” a law enforcement source told Fox News. “I believe that it was a steady drumbeat” that got “louder and louder” until “it ultimately led to” his retirement the source said. POLICE UNION SLAMS NYC LEADERS FOR 'AMATEUR-HOUR MEDDLING' THAT DROVE CHIEF OUT Other sources told the Post that de Blasio a Democrat berated Pichardo for missing a phone call following an hours-long shift responding to recent unrest in Brooklyn where crowds including Orthodox Jews protested against state coronavirus restrictions. De Blasio “routinely loses his s--t about missed phone calls” a source told the Post which provided multiple examples of the mayor’s controlling behavior toward Pichardo. “This is nothing but inappropriate meddling from a person who doesn’t know anything about patrol — even though he has been here for seven years” the source added. Pichardo is expected to step down within the next 30 days.  Patrick J. Lynch president of the NYPD union representing officers wrote in a statement shared on Twitter that Pichardo’s departure “is what happens when elected officials play political games with police department operations. … City Hall’s amateur-hour meddling has left the NYPD broken almost beyond repair.” Lynch said public safety was “suffering” as top talent from all ranks in the department was “being driven out the door.” In a statement to Fox News on Friday Lynch said the NYPD “has never seen so much talent and experience walking off the job as we have these past few months.” “This is the highest attrition rate we have seen in over a decade during a time we are battling enormous spikes in shootings and murders” Lynch wrote. “And thanks to the City Council and Mayor’s ‘Defund the Police’ lunacy no help is coming any time soon. Our elected leaders need to be held responsible for the dangerous path they’ve chosen.” Asked about the media reports surrounding Pichardo’s decision de Blasio fired back that it was “a personal decision based on personal and family factors.” “I spoke to him last night several times. I spoke to him this morning” the mayor said during a Wednesday press conference. He later added: “There was one thing we needed to talk about and I think there was some miscommunication.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Shea's job may also be in jeopardy. The Post reported earlier this week that the seven Democratic candidates currently running for mayor in 2021 are unanimous in saying they would fire Shea if elected. Shea responded by telling PIX 11: “It’s good to see that I have finally succeeded in uniting New Yorkers I guess."" The candidates also had less than favorable things to say about de Blasio with all agreeing that they would not accept his endorsement if offered.  ", https://www.foxnews.com/us/shakeup-nypd-new-york-city-police-chief-retirement-department-departures,0.8103112525759864
219,NYPD woes mount: Patrol chief's sudden retirement part of 'troubling' exodus, The left is desperate to defeat President Trump in his bid for reelection — by any means necessary. Look no further than Big Tech’s censoring of an inflammatory investigative report in The New York Post this week about the shady business dealings of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and China. The jaw-dropping disclosures by the newspaper reveal emails never before made public that detail Hunter Biden’s lucrative and highly conflicted actions with wealthy businessmen in Kiev and Beijing. BIDEN LASHES OUT AT CBS REPORTER WHEN ASKED ABOUT NY POST REPORT: 'I HAVE NO RESPONSE ANOTHER SMEAR CAMPAIGN' It’s now abundantly clear the people who run the social media giants like Facebook and Twitter believe it’s their duty to put their thumbs on the scale to help former Vice President Biden defeat President Trump in the November election. This shouldn’t surprise anyone because this dangerous behavior extends far beyond liberal social media bias. In fact it’s been going on to an alarming degree for the duration of the Trump administration. The entire liberal media establishment has been politicized and has worked to destroy President Trump since he was duly elected as our 45th president on Nov. 8 2016. Sure there’s always been media bias in our country. But under Trump the left-wing media have teamed up with the Democratic National Committee. News organizations like The New York Times Washington Post and NBC now behave like pro-Biden Super PACs. After NBC “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie’s partisan performance at the town hall with President Trump televised by her network Thursday night NBC should be known as the National Biden Channel. All eyes will be on debate moderator and NBC reporter Kristen Welker when she asks questions at this coming Thursday’s final presidential debate between Trump and Biden that will air on many networks and news channels. At the same time Guthrie was asking President Trump every tough question in the book Thursday night on ABC former Clinton staffer and now chief anchor for the network George Stephanopoulos was gently tossing Biden softballs. Stephanopoulos found no time to ask Joe Biden about the Hunter Biden and The New York Post story. The level of blatant bias in the dramatically different treatment Biden and President Trump received at their town halls is simply absurd. The truth is that there are investigative journalists at mainstream media outlets who would love to dive into the Hunter Biden story — but because their news organizations are obviously supporting Biden they’re not allowed to do so. Any objective person can see that the Hunter Biden story is big and could lead to a Pulitzer Prize. This is another example of a biased media forced to miss the real story for political purposes —just like with the Trump-Russia collusion hoax. The saga of C-SPAN’s suspended political editor and “Washington Journal” host Steve Scully is another example of anti-Trump bias in the media. Scully was supposed to be the moderator of the second presidential debate set to air this week night before it was canceled. But last week Scully appeared to have messaged anti-Trumper Anthony Scaramucci for advice about whether he should respond to President Trump’s criticism of Scully’s work early in his career as an intern for then-Sen. Joe Biden. Scully’s message was supposed to have been private but ended up on the public side of Twitter for the world to see. The blowback was harsh prompting Scully to claim that his account was hacked and that he didn’t write the message. Since then Scully’s excuse has turned out to be a lie causing him to be suspended indefinitely by C-SPAN. The Presidential Debate Commission must answer for why it chose a former Biden intern to moderate a Trump-Biden presidential debate in the first place. There’s a powerful reason that Facebook and Twitter have chosen to engage in censorship with The New York Post’s dynamite story about Biden’s family corruption in the D.C. swamp. Look no further than failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She has blamed Facebook and Twitter in part for her loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 election. The former first lady senator and secretary of state regularly slams Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.  Eye-popping headlines like “Hillary Clinton slams Mark Zuckerberg as ‘Trumpian’ and ‘authoritarian’ says Facebook ‘intends’ to reelect Trump” in MarketWatch and “Hillary Clinton Argues ‘Mark Zuckerberg Should Pay a Price’ for False Facebook Ads” in the Hollywood Reporter make it clear that the highest levels of the liberal machine are putting enormous pressure on social media to tip the scale for Biden in 2020. As president of Citizens United I know firsthand that censorship and attempts to ban free political speech are real. In 2007 there was a law on the books that had the power to put me in jail for running advertisements to promote a documentary I made that was critical of Hillary Clinton. My organization had to go all the way to the Supreme Court to make sure my First Amendment free speech rights were not violated — a process that took three years. We narrowly won the case 5-4 in our nation’s highest court. I found it unbelievable that four justices took the position that certain forms of political speech in our country could be banned. The Barack Obama-Joe Biden administration opposed our 2010 victory for free speech from the beginning and did everything in its power to reverse it. For the past 10 years the entire Democratic establishment has made it a top priority to undo the freedoms that were reasserted by the landmark Citizens United decision but the pesky First Amendment keeps getting in their way. So if you’re waiting for Biden to renounce censorship in the case of Facebook and Twitter and The New York Post’s Hunter Biden story don’t hold your breath. The left — from Joe Biden to Barack Obama to Hillary Clinton— believes less free speech is good because that means less scrutiny for them and their dangerous plans for America. Sadly Joe Biden is controlled by left-wing forces in our country that oppose free speech that they disagree with. Look no further than the violence against conservative students and the banning of conservative speakers on campuses — along with the ongoing threats violence and criminal activity of radical far-left Antifa thugs in our city streets. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The Senate Judiciary Committee is right to issue subpoenas to Big Tech executives to explain their destructive and unconstitutional actions. Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham R-S.C. should also demand all communications from these companies that discusses how they decided to censor The New York Post’s story exposing the Biden family’s alleged international corruption — and whether there was coordination with the Biden campaign.    Election interference of this scale — controlling the free flow of information — is indeed a threat to democracy as Sen. Graham asserts. But isn’t it also an illegal corporate in-kind contribution to the Biden presidential campaign? Tough questions must be asked and defenders of the Constitution on the Judiciary Committee like Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas Mike Lee of Utah and Josh Hawley of Missouri are just the leaders to do it.    The left is doing everything in its power to defeat President Trump. But sometimes in the heat of battle knee-jerk actions can backfire and do more harm than good. Such is the case of censoring The New York Post. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Yes the Post’s story is devastating on its face. It shows that Joe Biden has been lying to the American people for years about what he knows about Hunter Biden’s compromising overseas business transactions.  But now the story is taking on a life of its own and will be 10 times more damaging to Biden. More Americans are starting to wonder: What’s all the hubbub about? This may include many first-time voters who want to know what Facebook and Twitter are trying to cover up for Biden.

220,David Bossie: Liberal media want Biden to become president cover up report about son’s shady business deals," The coronavirus pandemic has changed our lives dramatically -- from sheltering in place to being unable to eat inside restaurants. Some celebrities have used this time to focus on their diet and fitness routines while others were on a mission to live healthier lifestyles even before the pandemic. Here are a few stars whose lifestyle resolutions have paid off big time: Rebel Wilson In January actress Rebel Wilson dubbed 2020 as her “year of health."" Since then the 40-year-old star has been documenting her experience as she changes her diet and incorporates more exercise into her routine. Wilson has been working with fitness trainer Jono Castano who recently gave some insight into how the actress is achieving such milestone goals. The personal trainer’s key tips included focusing on nutrition working out five days a week balanced “supplementation and multivitamins” and “recovering well."" Earlier this month Wilson revealed she's six pounds away from her goal weight and dubbed herself ""Fit Amy” a reference to her “Pitch Perfect” character REBEL WILSON REVEALS SHE’S ONLY 6 POUNDS AWAY FROM HER GOAL WEIGHT Kelly Osbourne TV personality Kelly Osbourne 35 said she has shed 85 pounds over the past year.  The fashion designer who has publicly struggled with weight in the past recently opened up about her weight loss journey. In August the star appeared on the “Hollywood Raw with Dax Holt and Adam Glyn” podcast where she revealed that she went under the knife almost two years ago. KELLY OSBOURNE REVEALS SHE HAD GASTRIC SLEEVE SURGERY TWO YEARS AGO AMID WEIGHT LOSS: 'IT’S NOT A QUICK FIX' “I don’t give a f--k what anyone has to say. I did it I’m proud of it they can suck s--t. [I did the] gastric sleeve"" the star shared. ""All it does is change the shape of your stomach. I got that almost two years ago. I will never ever ever lie about it ever. It is the best thing I have ever done.” She also detailed the differences between her own procedure -- the removal of about 80% of the stomach -- and gastric bypass surgery. “If you don’t work out and you don’t eat right you gain weight. All it does is move you in the right direction. So anyone who’s thinking of doing something like this really think about that” Osbourne urged. “I had to do a year of stand-alone therapy to prepare myself for the surgery before I even had it. What people don’t realize is it cuts out this hormone that if you have addiction issues it stops your craving and it makes you not emotionally eat which is a huge problem for me."" She elaborated: ""I was sober before it did help I don’t crave alcohol at all anymore. All it is is a push in the right direction. It doesn’t solve all your problems. It’s not a quick fix.” Ayesha Curry Ayesha Curry the cookbook author and wife of NBA star Steph Curry made headlines for her new slimmer figure after welcoming her third child. She dropped 36 pounds during quarantine.  AYESHA CURRY SHARES SECRETS TO HER 35-POUND WEIGHT LOSS DURING QUARANTINE Curry’s secrets to weight loss included diet exercise sleep and heavy water consumption. New Jersey-based fitness expert Erin Palinski-Wade author of ""Belly Fat Diet For Dummies"" told Fox News: ""Quarantine has certainly been hard on most of us but being stuck in our homes has brought about some positive benefits."" ""For those who have found themselves with more time on their hands due to the quarantine many have been spending that time practicing self-care habits such as trying out new home workout routines transitioning to a more whole food diet with less processed choices and slowing down to help reduce stress"" Palinski-Wade said.  ""For some working from home has reduced commuting times and stressors freeing up time for more self-care behaviors. For others being home and having less restaurant availability has led to getting into the kitchen more and preparing more fresh meals and snacks that are often more nutritious than what you may have ordered out."" Mercedes “MJ” Javid ""Shahs of Sunset"" star Mercedes “MJ” Javid also changed up her lifestyle during the pandemic and took advantage of her time working from home.  “The positive thing about the pandemic for us has been a really healthy routine with food and exercise. We’ve cut… most if not all of the bad food out” she said on an episode of ""The Daily Dish"" podcast.  Lisa DeFazio a nutritionist who hasn't worked with any celebs told Fox News she's seen people adapt to the pandemic in different ways. ""Since March when quarantine really started to get strict here in the U.S. people went one way or the other"" she said. ""Many people were drinking more cooking more and eating more. Quarantine and a pandemic are the perfect storm for emotional and boredom eating and drinking! ""Then you have the other side where people have used this extra time to get serious with diet and exercise. It is the one thing they can control in a time where the world is out of control"" she added. ""For some people controlling their health and exercise eases their anxiety about COVID. For others eating high-fat foods baking bread and drinking alcohol eases their anxiety about COVID and quarantine.  It is human nature to cope in different ways depending on your personality and circumstances"" Lizzo Body positivity activist Lizzo recently celebrated six months of practicing veganism. ""I’m still that happy girl loving myself and loving my body"" the singer said on Tik Tok.  ""Love yourself at all stages in your life because you are who you are"" Lizzo said concluding her video. She also shared her workout routine during quarantine which included weights indoor cycling and jumping rope.  LIZZO DELIVERS POWERFUL MESSAGE ABOUT SUPPRESSION SELF-LOVE “Hey so I’ve been working out consistently for the last five years and it may come as a surprise to some of y'all that I’m not working out to have your ideal body type. I’m working out to have my ideal body type” she said in an earlier video. “And you know what type that is? None of your f------ business because I am beautiful I am strong I do my job and I stay on my job.” Jessica Simpson Another celebrity keeping up her health routine during the pandemic is Jessica Simpson.  She revealed she has lost 100 pounds after the birth of her third child in March 2019. JESSICA SIMPSON SHOWS OFF ABS AFTER 100-LBS. WEIGHT LOSS Palinski-Wade said Simpson's success is most likely a product of ""focusing on simple habits such as tracking her steps daily to ensure she stays active.""

221,Weight loss winners: Celebrities' 2020 lifestyle resolutions have paid off big time, The only member of the Kansas City Chiefs that was available and willing to discuss Le’Veon Bell arguably the biggest free-agent signing since the offseason happened to be the defensive coordinator who won't have anything to do with him. Steve Spagnuolo is happy for that too. Spagnuolo already had plenty of headaches trying to stop Bell when the two-time All-Pro running back was with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The longtime defensive whiz had five opportunities to shut down Bell who announced Wednesday that he was signing with the Chiefs and each time Spagnuolo found himself grasping at straws. CLICK HERE FOR MORE NFL COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM “Look it's great always to accumulate good football players” Spagnuolo said. “I haven't seen him or gone against him in a long time. But he was so challenging to stop in that dual play the Steelers ran where he'd just sit back there and pick and weave. No matter what you did it felt like you couldn't stop him for six or seven yards.” The Chiefs follow a strict schedule for making coaches and players available to reporters and coach Andy Reid general manager Brett Veach and Bell weren't available Friday. Bell could still be completing physicals and paperwork and he must pass a six-day COVID-19 protocol or get an exemption before he's allowed in the building so not even some of the folks in the Chiefs organization were quite sure when he would join the team. That's why Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy was quick to say: “I know there's been some discussion about a particular player. I'm going to defer all those questions to Coach Reid and Brett Veach.” “Right now our focus is on the Buffalo Bills” Bieniemy said. “We need to make sure we get this chip off our shoulder.” Bell won't be able to help them by Monday night of course. But he should provide a big lift for a struggling run game the rest of the season especially as the Chiefs (4-1) chase a first-round playoff bye in the defense of their Super Bowl title. Bell became a bona fide star with Pittsburgh where he ran for at least 1200 yards and caught 75 passes in three different seasons. But things went haywire after he skipped the 2018 season amid a contract dispute. Bell signed a four-year $52.5 million deal with $35 million guaranteed with the New York Jets but he never quite meshed with coach Adam Gase and he was released this week after they failed to find any suitable trade partners. Bell was reportedly considering three teams before settling on Kansas City where he will back up Clyde Edwards-Helaire. The rookie out of LSU who was the Chiefs' first-round pick in this year's draft raised eyebrows by running for 138 yards with touchdowns on the ground and through the air in his debut against Houston. But Edwards-Helaire had just 38 yards rushing the following week 64 yards rushing each of the next two and 40 yards rushing last Sunday against the Raiders — when the Chiefs lost 40-32 to end their franchise-record 13-game winning streak. “We drafted Clyde for a reason. Clyde is doing a heck of a job” Bieniemy said. “The rest of that” — referring again to Bell — “I'm going to let Coach Reid address that. He's the head coach for a reason and Brett Veach is the general manager for a reason. Once they address that I'll make sure I jump in. But Clyde is doing a heck of a job.” He also can't do it alone and that's another reason the Chiefs signed Bell. They thought they would have Damien Williams to provide a 1-2 punch but he opted out due to COVID-19. That left only Darrel Williams who has carried 11 times for 35 yards and Darwin Thompson who has six carries for 32 yards to give Edwards-Helaire a break in the backfield. Edwards-Helaire has run 81 times for 344 yards. The rest of the team which includes quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the wide receivers the Chiefs use on jet sweeps have combined for just 51 carries and 213 yards. So while Bieniemy might be unwilling to say it the Chiefs' defensive coordinator is: “I'm sure our offensive guys will be glad to have him” Spagnuolo said. , https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-locker-room-mum-on-bell-arrival-well-almost,0.8103112433622505

""Should he have three negative PCR tests through the SEC appointed lab each 24 hours apart the initial test would be considered a false positive pursuant to SEC protocols and he would be allowed to return.” Allen said Saban has remained asymptomatic and hasn't had a fever. But unless Saban tests negative again Friday and Saturday he will remain sidelined for the game against the Bulldogs. Saban and athletic director Greg Byrne tested positive on Wednesday. The 68-year-old coach has continued to work from home and even been able to relay messages during practice via team managers.

223,Alabama's Saban tests negative for COVID-19 in follow-up, A federal grand jury indicted a former Los Angeles Angels employee on drug charges for allegedly providing Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs with the drugs that caused his overdose death. Eric Prescott Kay was charged Thursday with drug distribution and drug conspiracy in Skaggs' overdose death according to the indictment in Fort Worth Texas. The charges carry a maximum of a life sentence and 20 years in prison respectively. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Kay remained free on his own recognizance.

Skaggs 27 was found dead in his suburban Dallas hotel room on July 1 2019 before the start of what was supposed to be a four-game series against the Texas Rangers. The first game was postponed. A coroner’s report said Skaggs had choked to death on his vomit with a toxic mix of alcohol and the drugs fentanyl and oxycodone in his system which Kay was accused of providing. Kay was the Angels’ director of communications and he served as their public relations contact on many road trips. He was placed on leave shortly after Skaggs’ death and he never returned to the team. Team officials said they had not been aware that Skaggs was an opioids user and didn’t know any employees were providing drugs to players. , https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ex-angels-employee-indicted-in-tyler-skaggs-fatal-overdose,0.810293094983783
224,Ex-Angels employee indicted in Tyler Skaggs' fatal overdose," From New England to Atlanta to Indianapolis the focus was not on football on Friday. It was on not surprisingly coronavirus tests. The Patriots canceled practice Friday and later placed center James Ferentz on the reserve/COVID-19 list. He became the fifth player on the team to test positive for the virus. With the Colts there were four positive tests that when retested came up negative. The Falcons returned to their facility one day after abandoning it when they had a second positive. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New England (2-2) already twice had the original Week 5 matchup against Denver postponed following four earlier positive coronavirus tests by players including quarterback Cam Newton and cornerback Stephon Gilmore. The game is scheduled for Sunday in Foxborough Massachusetts but now could be in jeopardy. “I don’t really know the answer to that"" Broncos coach Vic Fangio said when asked about finally playing the Patriots. ""We’re under the assumption and understanding that this game’s going to go off on time. And anything that happens otherwise will happen when it happens.” Newton and Gilmore the reigning Defensive Player of the Year returned to practice this week for the first time since testing positive for the virus. Newton missed New England’s loss at Kansas City on Oct. 5 after his Oct. 2 positive test. He was activated from the reserve/COVID-19 list on Wednesday. Gilmore who tested positive on Oct. 7 was activated from the list Thursday. Practice squad player Bill Murray also returned from the COVID-19 list Thursday. Defensive tackle Byron Cowart who tested positive on Oct. 11 was joined on the list by Ferentz. The Broncos (1-3) haven’t played since Oct. 1. If they play Sunday they’ll have had 16 days between games one day longer than Tennessee’s layoff before the Titans beat Buffalo on Tuesday night following the NFL’s first COVID-19 outbreak which affected two dozen members of the organization. Denver's layoff is the longest in the league since 2001 when the NFL postponed all games on the weekend following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Three teams — the Saints Steelers and Buccaneers — had byes when play resumed a week later so they all had 20 days between games that year. Of those three only the Steelers won in their return to action. Indianapolis closed its practice facility then the four retests came back negative and the building reopened. Coach Frank Reich did not identify who had the false positives but acknowledged if it wasn’t a player it was someone who worked closely with the players. He did say the four were kept out of the facility. Reich had started making contingency plans to play the Bengals on Monday or Tuesday and also rearranged Friday’s schedule. Meetings were conducted virtually and after the second set of results came back the Colts went through a lighter-than-normal practice at team headquarters while wearing masks. “It just made sense that we could jog through get all the looks we needed to get get our bodies going a little bit get the heart rate going a little bit but not going full speed” Reich said. “It would have had to been masks under the helmet so I just felt like it was the right thing to do — not go full speed with the mask under the helmet.” The Browns who played the Colts on Sunday had zero positive tests Friday morning and their building was open. The negatives included one for star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. who was ill and sent home Thursday and not allowed to practice Friday. Atlanta resumed in-person work under more stringent safety measures. “Just with the intensive regulations the mask protocol is in high effect” interim coach Raheem Morris said. “We have to do some of those different type of deals. Masks on the field player separation on the field. The in-person meetings only in two areas: The team meeting room and the indoor facility. All of those things we had to implement. “Everything dealing with the disease and the COVID and what we’ve got to deal with I will follow to the highest and protect the team at all costs even if it means shutting down a practice like yesterday.” The Falcons play Sunday at Minnesota. Rookie defensive tackle Marlon Davidson was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list Tuesday and a second person who is not a player subsequently tested positive. The Panthers have guard/center Tyler Larsen on the reserve/COVID-19 list five days after he played against Atlanta. “I know a lot of people have had their lives interrupted in a very negative way whether it be through the illness itself whether it be through losing their job whether it be through having to take a pay cut” Fangio said. ""You know nobody deserves that. And some small businesses people who have worked their whole lives to establish a business are really struggling right now. And I know some small business owners from all over the country where I’ve been and they’re struggling. “And luckily here in the NFL so far as players and coaches we haven’t missed any paychecks so we’re just going to keep fighting through and consider us lucky. And yes we’ve been inconvenienced there are a lot of protocols to follow some of them can be a little overbearing at times but they’re necessary. “And so I think in the big picture we’ve been lucky.” ", https://www.foxnews.com/sports/patriots-cancel-practice-after-5th-player-tests-positive,0.8103182989412777
225,Patriots cancel practice after 5th player tests positive," Xander Schauffele began his second round by missing a 4-foot birdie putt. That was hardly a sign of what was to follow Friday in the CJ Cup at Shadow Creek. Schauffele made putts as short as 3 feet and as long as 35 feet. He chipped in from 20 feet. He seemingly couldn't miss during a two-hour stretch when he made seven birdies over eight holes including six in a row for a career-best 29 on the back nine. His momentum slowed with the pace of play and he settled an 8-under 64 for a three-shot lead over Tyrrell Hatton. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM “Some of those holes you're not really trying to birdie them you're just trying to leave yourself an uphill 35-footer. And fortunately I made a couple of them” Schauffele said. ""It was a nice stretch. Got a little bit stale there on the other side. Pace of play slowed down a lot kind of hot easy to let the mind wander. “Upset I didn't make more birdies but pleased I didn't make any bogeys.” He was at 14-under 130 and now has the course record at Shadow Creek which is hosting the CJ Cup for this year only because the COVID-19 pandemic made travel to South Korea impractical. Hatton among six players who were in England last week for the European Tour's flagship event was headed for a rocky finish when he laid up into the rough on the par-5 16th that led to a second straight bogey. He rallied to close with a pair of birdies for a 68. Russell Henley (68) was another shot back at 10-under 134. Defending champion Justin Thomas found some momentum with six birdies despite missing two easy chances on par 5s for a 66 and was eight shots behind at the halfway point. “I guess I played my way somewhat back into it” he said before turning to look at the scores on a nearby monitor. “But Xander kind of went off today so that makes it a little harder.” Thomas kept glancing at video boards trying to figure out what Schauffele was doing besides making a lot of birdies. “This is a place you can do it” Thomas said. “You can go crazy low out here. You've got a lot of bowl pins a lot of pins you can get close to. If you don't have control of your ball as firm as the greens are you can make a lot of bogeys too.” It wasn't just Schauffele making birdies. He played alongside PGA champion Collin Morikawa who shot a 65 and Viktor Hovland who had a 66. They were a combined 21-under par with a better-ball score of 59. Schauffele was doing most of the damage. After his tee shot to 3 feet on the 211-yard 13th hole he rolled in a 25-foot putt on the next hole a birdie putt from just over 35 feet on the 15th two-putted from a sidehill lie on the fringe at the par-5 16th and looked to be in trouble on the par-3 17th when his tee shot landed beyond the green near the creek. The hop was gentle leaving him in thick grass and he chipped in. Then on the par-5 18th he had to lay up from a fairway bunker hit wedge to 15 feet below the hole and made that. That's when he hit the brakes and so did the tournament. The course has enough reachable par 5s (and one par 4) to lead to congestion. And with so few volunteers there is a lot of searching for balls along with provisional tee shots. Hovland had one just short of the par-3 fifth hole as he looked through thick grass framing the bunkers. Brooks Koepka had his entire group searching left of the seventh fairway (he also hit a provisional) until it was found. He took a penalty drop into the rough advanced it down the fairway and made a 12-footer for par. Koepka who was 6 under through 13 holes had to settle for a 68. He was 10 shots behind. Jon Rahm who can return to No. 1 in the world with a victory this week made a 5-foot eagle putt on his fourth hole. He made four bogeys and no birdies over his next 10 holes birdied the last for a 73 and was 10 shots behind. Rory McIlroy had a mixed bag of seven birdies and four bogeys for a 69 leaving him 12 behind and looking for momentum to carry into next week at Sherwood Country Club.

226,Schauffele goes on birdie run and leads at Shadow Creek," Brazilian soccer team Santos has suspended a newly-signed contract with international star Robinho after a sponsor made reference to the player's past sexual assault case and cut its ties with the club. “Santos and Robinho have by mutual agreement resolved to suspend the contract signed on 10 October so that player can concentrate exclusively on his court defense in Italy” the club said in a statement posted on Twitter on Friday. In 2017 the former Manchester City forward was sentenced by an Italian court to nine years in prison for his involvement in the rape of a 22-year-old woman at a nightclub in 2013. Robinho has appealed the ruling and the case is continuing. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The 36-year-old Robinho began his career at Santos before starring with Real Madrid Manchester City and AC Milan among other clubs. This was to be his third stint with Santos. Brazilian orthodontics franchise Orthopride announced this week it had ended its sponsorship deal with Santos “out of respect for women” after the club announced Robinho's signing. Orthopride chief operating officer Richard Magrath told Globo Esporte: “We have enormous respect for Santos’ history. But at this point we have decided to terminate the sponsorship contract. “Our audience is mostly female and out of respect for the women who buy our products we had to make that decision. We want to make it clear that we were not previously informed about the signing of Robinho we were taken by surprise by the news over the weekend.” Robinho posted a video on Twitter and which was retweeted on several media websites saying: “I will prove my innocence.""

227,Santos ends contract with Robinho after sponsor complaints," The blowback from a sign-stealing scandal three years ago and a losing record during the pandemic-shortened regular season don't mean a thing to Dusty Baker and the Houston Astros. Like them or loathe them the Astros are on the cusp of a third World Series in four seasons and joining the 2004 Boston Red Sox as the only teams to rally from a 3-0 deficit to win a seven-game series. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM George Springer and José Altuve delivered big hits Framber Valdéz pitched six brilliant innings and the Astros beat the Tampa Bay Rays for the third straight time 7-4 Friday to force a deciding Game 7 of the AL Championship Series. It's been a stunning turnaround in a series that had been going the Rays' way as they opened a 3-0 lead. “We’re not through writing history” Baker said. “We’re hoping we can have a happy ending to this historic season and historic year. “This team’s battled back big time” added Baker hired to bring some stability to a team rocked by a sign-stealing scandal it used en route to the 2017 title that was uncovered last offseason. “You’ve got to love this team or some people hate this team but I mean you’ve at least got to respect this team the way that they’ve worked."" Houston chased starter Blake Snell in the fifth before Springer hit a go-ahead two-run single and scored on Altuve’s double. Carlos Correa who hit a walkoff home run in Thursday night’s 4-3 win added an RBI single. “We're relentless and when we said we didn't want to go home we really meant that” Correa said. “We want to keep playing baseball and we don't want this to be the end of our season. We took care of these three games and now we've got to take one more. If we don't win that game then it's all meant nothing. We've got to go out there tomorrow and get that win. It'll be great.” Earlier this week some of the Astros watched a documentary on the 2004 Red Sox who after falling behind 3-0 won four straight games to stun the New York Yankees for the AL pennant before winning their first World Series in 86 seasons. Otherwise big league clubs leading 3-0 in a best-of-seven postseason series are 37-1. Houston also is trying to become the first team to win a pennant with a losing regular season record (29-31). The Astros have been criticized for their role in a cheating scandal en route to the 2017 title that was uncovered last offseason. Manuel Margot homered twice and drove in three runs for the Rays. Despite blowing a 3-0 series lead they remain one win from the second World Series in franchise history — and one loss from joining the 2004 Yankees in ignominy. Game 7 on Saturday night will feature the pitchers who started and finished Houston’s Game 7 win against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2017 World Series. Lance McCullers Jr. will go for the Astros while 36-year-old Charlie Morton will start for the Rays. They are the first pair to pitch in the same winner-take-all postseason game as teammates and later start against each other in a winner-take-all game. In the decisive Game 7 in 2017 McCullers started and went 2 1/3 scoreless innings while Morton pitched the final four innings for the victory. Morton signed with Tampa Bay prior to the 2019 season. It’s also a rematch of Game 2 of this series won 4-2 by Morton and the Rays. “We’ve just got to bounce back” Rays manager Kevin Cash said. ""This isn’t the scenario that we wanted leading 3-0 but this is a resilient group. Encouraged that the offense kind of got going there. Look for some carryover. “There’s no doubt the momentum has shifted but I would bet on this team being very capable of bouncing back” he said. Valdéz who lost the opener of this series 2-1 to Snell held the Astros to one run and three hits while striking out nine and walking three in his third career postseason start. He allowed Willy Adames RBI double in the second. Astros closer Ryan Pressly pitched for the third straight day and got three outs for his second save to go with a win in Game 5. He allowed Yoshitomo Tsutsugo's one-out single then induced Mike Brosseau's game-ending double-play grounder a call upheld in a video review. Pressly threw nine pitches all for strikes raising his three-day total to 39. The 71-year-old Baker who led NL teams for the first 22 seasons of his 23-year managerial career used some old-school baseball to outfox the 42-year-old Cash and overturn a 1-0 deficit in the fifth. The rally had only one hard-hit ball. The Astros had been frustrated in the first three games when they scalded balls right to fielders. Snell walked Yuli Gurriel opening the fifth and allowed a single to Aledmys Díaz on his 82nd pitch. Cash whose team was built around analytics pulled Snell before he could face the No. 9 batter Martín Maldonado and leadoff hitter Springer who had struck out twice. Maldonado laid down a sacrifice bunt against Diego Castillo and Springer punched a two-run single to center through a hole in Tampa Bay’s drawn-in infield that also was in a shift. Altuve followed with a double into the left-field corner that brought in Springer who might have been out if Brandon Lowe had thrown to the cutoff man instead of second base. After Michael Brantley walked Correa singled to bring in Altuve. Snell allowed two runs and three hits in four-plus innings struck out four and walked four. Baker hired after AJ Hinch was fired following the revelation of the sign-stealing scandal is the first manager to take five different teams to the playoffs. He has yet to win a World Series as a manager. His San Francisco Giants reached the 2002 Fall Classic before losing in seven games to the Angels. As a player he helped the Los Angeles Dodgers win four straight World Series games in 1981 after falling behind the New York Yankees 0-2. Houston’s Kyle Tucker homered off rookie Shane McClanahan leading off the sixth. In the seventh Brantley hit an RBI single and Tucker a sacrifice fly. Margot homered off Andre Scrubb leading off the Rays’ seventh and hit a two-run shot off Cristian Javier with two outs in the eighth. “We’re all frustrated but I don’t think they’re tensing up” Cash said. “I think they recognize we’ve got an opportunity for the fourth time to do something special and find ways we can really compete get the bats going score some runs for Charlie and find a way to win.” MODERN BALL There were 33 pitches in the top of the eighth and none put in play The Astros loaded the bases on three walks and then had three strikeouts. Baker said they were lucky that inning didn't come back to haunt them. UP NEXT Astros: McCullers struck out 11 in seven innings in taking the loss in Game 2. He allowed four runs only one earned and four hits. Rays: Morton pitched five scoreless innings in winning Game 2.

228,Springer Valdéz help Astros top Rays 7-4 force ALCS Game 7, After modeling for seven years Kim Riekenberg is making her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit debut. The German star is featured in the current issue on newsstands now which also highlights Kate Bock Jasmine Sanders and Olivia Culpo as the newest coveted cover girls. Riekenberg who was discovered while eating pizza in Hamburg did her SI shoot in Wyoming a state that reminded her of her childhood home. Afterward she had no qualms sharing the sizzling snaps with her boyfriend’s family. Riekenberg spoke to Fox News about seeing her SI photos for the first time how she stays in shape all year her guilty food pleasures and the fellow German model she gets compared to. SI SWIMSUIT MODEL HALEY KALIL EXPLAINS WHY SHE CRIED AFTER SEEING HER PICS: 'THIS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING' Fox News: How does it feel to be part of SI Swimsuit’s 2020 issue?Kim Riekenberg: Well it's such an exciting moment for me because I'm a rookie. I'm new to this family but as I said in so many interviews before already it felt like a family from the first moment. Even when I walked into [editor] MJ Day’s office for the casting I was so welcomed and we had such a lovely talk. It was very different from a typical casting. And I just left the building with such a good feeling and the journey just continued like that. So I'm very glad that I had this opportunity to finally shoot for them. And I take it in my heart and can't wait for more Fox News: How were you discovered as a model?Riekenberg: It’s a little bit cliché because I was in Hamburg for a shopping tour. I grew up in a very small town so during school holidays I would go to Hamburg for a shopping tour. And then we just had lunch me and my friends. And then my [future] booker came over. She asked me how tall I was and if I would be interested to come to the agency after lunch. And me holding the pizza what do you expect what do you say? I just said yes and actually went there. And from there on my journey continued.  SI SWIMSUIT MODEL OLIVIA BROWER FIRST SAW HER PHOTOS AT A PHARMACY WITH THE FAMILY: ‘I’M HONORED’ Fox News: What was it like growing up in a small town?Riekenberg: I was in the woods all the time. I [caught] frogs and just played with dirt across all the fields where the cows are. And well sometimes you stepped in some s—t as well [laughs]. I was just a nature child. I was very creative with my friends. We didn’t have cell phones and we didn’t have social media so we had to be a little bit more creative. … But I really loved it. Fox News: For your SI Swimsuit shoot you went to Wyoming. What was it like?Riekenberg: Well I never really traveled far into the country in America until that day so it was very exciting going there. I just heard so many great stories [about Wyoming] and I was very curious how it was going to look. We went in the fall which is the perfect season of the year. There are so many beautiful colors surrounding you. The trees were green but up in the mountains there was snow already. It felt like I was surrounded by a living painting. It all felt so unreal.  We had these little tiny houses for ourselves. It was a very old ranch that they rebuilt. I felt like I was in a fairy tale or movie. It was so different from what I have experienced before. But it was very cold! So knowing you have to shoot in a bikini the next day you have to mentally prepare [laughs]. But I was so excited about this shoot that I honestly forgot how cold it was. And the team would throw me a blanket every time a shot was done.  Once I was done I just jumped into a warm van that they had heated up for me. The whole experience was so lovely. Knowing that I was a rookie there was a sense of excitement in the air. And I just knew my life changed that day as a model. It’s another step in my career. But it was all just so beautiful. SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT MODEL KATHY JACOBS 56 DETAILS SURPRISING FAN MAIL FROM MEN: 'IT'S SUPER SWEET' Fox News: What was going through your mind when you saw your photos for the first time?Riekenberg: My boyfriend was actually next to me. That day the launch day was when the family of my boyfriend was here. I just saw it randomly on my phone that they finally posted my first picture. I was just so excited. I was like 'Yay!'  I just showed it around. I almost cried but I was able to hold it back for a little bit. But it was so exciting. And I couldn’t fall asleep that night because I was so excited to finally see it.  I remember showing them [my photo] in a bikini. I was like 'Hi that’s me.' [laughs]. But I think they were kind of proud too. And we all cheered after that. It was a beautiful moment. It was actually nice to share it with someone especially since we couldn’t celebrate as an SI family this year. … But there will be a time when we can all see each other again soon. Fox News: How did you physically prepare for your shoot?Riekenberg: It’s funny because I actually didn’t have so much time to prepare. I only had 10 days to prepare because my spot was the last one and I got the confirmation so spontaneously before the shoot. So all I could do is eat a little bit more healthy and go to my Pilates class as I always do. But I kind of appreciate that I didn’t have so much time to prepare because it was like take it as it comes. Be who you are. Don’t change anything about yourself. MJ liked me the way I was. I felt even more confident just being myself. I tried to shine the best that I could. SI SWIMSUIT MODEL CAMILLE KOSTEK TALKS APPEARING IN MAG: 'I ALWAYS HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THAT FIRST BIKINI’ Fox News: It seems like Pilates is very popular among SI Swimsuit models.Riekenberg: I always do Pilates wherever I am. I always find myself a studio because that’s the one [workout routine] I like. And I think it shapes your body very well. And you don’t have to do it every day because it’s intense. At my studio they just say 'Go two to three times but no more.' Because then if you continue doing it it will knock you out. We still need a lot of energy to do our shoots and jobs and travel. You have to find the balance. Fox News: What’s on your plate for cheat day?Riekenberg: It’s something salty which would be pizza or pasta. And then it would be something sweet after because there’s always a spot for dessert I think. And it will be something creamy and chocolaty --everything I can get. Fox News: Germany is known for its chocolate.Riekenberg: I’m [lucky] over here [laughs]. But actually Germans love Italian food so we have a lot of Italian places here. And I have so say I love Italian too. So lucky me we have so many. SI SWIMSUIT MODEL MYLA DALBESIO RECALLS BEING BODY-SHAMED OVER HER SIZE: 'IT’S BEEN A LONG JOURNEY' Fox News: Have you been compared to Claudia Schiffer?Riekenberg: A few people are telling me this but actually at the moment I get compared with Heidi Klum so much because she was 25 when she got the cover for SI. So in Germany this is the thing that is the topic at the moment. It’s funny you always get compared in this industry. , https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sports-illustrated-swimsuit-rookie-kim-riekenberg,0.8103188830869481
229,SI Swimsuit 'rookie' Kim Riekenberg recalls showing sizzling snaps to boyfriend’s family," One Will Smith outdid another Will Smith to keep the season alive for the Los Angeles Dodgers. A common name a special result for the Dodgers catcher. Smith hit a go-ahead three-run homer off the Atlanta Braves reliever with the same name Corey Seager homered twice and the Dodgers avoided elimination with a 7-3 win in Game 5 of the NL Championship Series on Friday night. “I’ll always bet on our Will Smith” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Smith connected in the sixth against — of all people — Will Smith the fourth of six Braves pitchers in their bullpen night that started with a couple of postseason firsts by A.J. Minter. “For him to come through for us in that spot. I’m happy to see him expressing himself” Dodgers right fielder Mookie Betts said of his teammate who rarely shows emotion but was clearly pumped up by his big blast. Betts got that decisive sixth started with an infield single and the first-year Dodger and former AL MVP had a running shoestring catch in right field that turned into an inning-ending double play. His snag took an Atlanta run off the board after a replay challenge right before Seager's first homer. “You’re talking about momentum shifts that’s the play of the year"" Roberts said. “I just thought there was no way he was going to make that play.” Game 6 is Saturday afternoon with a pitching rematch from the series opener: lefty Max Fried for the Braves and right-hander Walker Buehler for the Dodgers. Both gave up one run in Game 1 which Atlanta won 5-1 after a four-run ninth. Atlanta is looking to get into the World Series for the first time since 1999. “I knew it was going to be a really hard series regardless of what situation you’re in” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “I feel good tomorrow with Max on the mound. I feel really good with him going out there. Hopefully we can score a few runs and support him and wrap this thing up.” Blake Treinen the third of seven Dodgers pitchers and the Game 1 loser in relief pitched two perfect innings for the win. Inconsistent closer Kenley Jansen struck out the side in a non-save situation to end it which Roberts called a highlight for him. Betts had a stolen base after his sixth-starting single before Justin Turner's one-out hard grounder that got Betts caught in a rundown. The Braves then brought in their lefty named Will Smith to face left-handed batter Max Muncy who drew a walk before the Dodgers' catcher named Will Smith hit a full-count pitch 404 feet to left-center for a 4-2 lead. “It got the team going. that energy bounces off of each other” Smith said. It was the first time since at least 1961 that a batter homered off a pitcher with the same name in the regular season or postseason according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The Dodgers extended their lead in the seventh when Chris Taylor hit a two-out double and scored on a single by Betts before Seager hit a ball into LA's bullpen in right-center. Seager's four homers and 10 RBIs have already tied NLCS records with at least one more game for the Dodgers to play — two if they want a chance to get to the World Series for the third time in four years. The four homers are already a record for a shortstop in any postseason series. “Just kind of putting good swings on pitches and everything is kind of clicking” Seager said. Taylor turned an ankle in left field during the eighth inning but remained in the game. Manager Dave Roberts said Taylor would get treatment and testing prior to Game 6. Minter struck out seven of the 10 batters he faced as the first pitcher in MLB history whose first start came in a postseason game. The fourth-year big leaguer became the first pitcher — starter or reliever — with seven strikeouts in three innings or fewer in a postseason game. He had already matched his career high before striking out the side — all on called third strikes — in the third before leaving with a 2-0 lead. After Marcell Ozuna and Travis d'Arnaud had consecutive singles to start the third for Atlanta there was one out when Dansby Swanson hit a sinking liner to right. Betts made a running catch with his glove skimming the ground before his throw home was late. But the Dodgers challenged that Ozuna that left third base early — and it became the Braves third out instead of their third run. “We were able to get a stop” Betts said. “Yesterday we couldn’t stop the bleeding. Today we were able to get a stop right there and put some pressure on them.” Umpires and the off-site replay crew needed nearly two minutes to make their ruling but Dodgers fielders — and even Braves runners — had already left the field after watching the play on the big video board. “It's not always on the offensive side that you get the spark” Seager said. “A big play in a big moment you get some energy.” Right after that Seager's leadoff homer to straightaway center in the fourth cut the Dodgers deficit to 2-1. Rookie center fielder Cristian Pache made a leaping try at the wall but the ball went just behind his extended glove. But Pache did time things up in the eighth robbing Muncy of a homer with a nearly identical play. The Braves scored in both innings off LA starter Dustin May. Freddie Freeman doubled went to third and scored on d'Arnaud's sacrifice fly in the first and Pache had an RBI single in the second. D'Arnaud added an RBI groundout in the eighth. CATCHER COMEBACK Smith became only the third catcher in Dodgers franchise history to hit a go-ahead home run in the postseason. The last was Steve Yeager in Game 5 of the 1981 World Series of Ron Guidry of the New York Yankees. The other was Roy Campanella who did it twice: in Game 3 of the 1953 World Series and Game 3 of the 1955 World Series. FIRST RBIS The 21-year-old Pache who has played in only two regular season games in the big leagues has an RBI in each of his four NLCS starts. He became a starter after outfielder Adam Duvall's left oblique injury in the series opener. LOT OF RELIEF Minter hadn’t started a game since his junior season at Texas A&amp;M in 2015 the same year Atlanta drafted him in the second round. He had made 144 relief appearances (139 regular season five playoff games) the past four seasons for the Braves along with 77 minor league games before his first professional start.

230,Smith off Smith Seager 2 HRs as Dodgers beat Braves in NLCS, Down by double-digits late in the third quarter BYU did not panic. The Cougars scored the final 29 points to remain undefeated. Zach Wilson threw four touchdowns and finished 25 of 35 for 400 yards as No. 14 BYU rallied for a 43-26 win over Houston on Friday night. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM “The statement we made is that we are big time team” Wilson said. “Average teams are inconsistent and can’t finish games off. There wasn’t a moment of that tonight. Every single play every single drive was we are going to execute the next drive.” Dax Milne caught nine passes for 184 yards and three touchdowns to help BYU improve to 5-0 for the first time since 2008. BYU outgained Houston 478-438. “That dude’s a playmaker” Wilson said of Milne. “I love that guy. He’s one of my best friends I’m so happy for him. … I believed in that guy since day one. I’ve always known he was going to be a big-time player for us.” Down 12 Wilson found Milne for a 2-yard touchdown pass with 53 seconds remaining in the third. Wilson gave BYU the lead back with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Masen Wake with 10:35 left to make it 29-26 following a 2-point conversion pass from Wilson to Tyler Allgeier. “They had the lead on us” BYU coach Kalani Sitake said. “I’m proud of our players and the way they were able to respond to adversity. We got caught in some things. It’s weird because we got the momentum early and it starts slipping away. Then we had to regroup at halftime and get in the locker room and talk things over. Wilson threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Milne with three minutes remaining before Allgeier iced it with a 14-yard touchdown run with 1:40 left. Clayton Tune finished 21 of 31 for 310 yards and two touchdowns to lead Houston (1-1). “They were starting to twist up front which was something we hadn’t seen on film” Tune said of BYU’s defensive change in the fourth quarter. Kyle Porter had 20 carries for 94 yards. Christian Trahan caught three passes for 69 yards and a touchdown and Keith Corbin caught four passes for 58 yards. “We did a lot of good things” Houston coach Dana Holgorsen said. “It’s just when the game got tight in the fourth quarter they whipped us. They elevated their game and we didn’t.” Trailing by 11 to start the second quarter Houston scored 23 straight points to take a 26-14 lead with three minutes left in the third. Tune threw touchdown passes of 20 and 5 yards to Trahan and Nathaniel Dell respectively and Dalton Witherspoon hit a 49-yard field goal to give Houston a 20-14 lead at the half. Witherspoon also had a 27-yard field goal in the first. Tune increased the lead to 12 on a 5-yard rushing touchdown that capped a 16-play 98-yard drive. Tune was nearly sacked before breaking the tackle juking out a defender and diving for the goal line. “We knew what the issues were on that drive” Sitake said. “We set out to fix it. And as we started to fix it there’s no panic in the coaches or the players. We just knew that we had to get it fixed and as we started to do that our offense started to click. The result was what happened.” BYU struck fast with Wilson finding Milne for a career-long 78-yard touchdown pass on BYU’s first play to make it 7-3 with 9 ½ minutes left in the first. Lapini Katoa upped the lead to 14-3 on a 1-yard touchdown run with 4:42 remaining in the first. THE TAKEAWAY BYU: The Cougars got their offense going late to avoid the upset and the defense stepped up late holding Houston to 22 yards in the fourth quarter. Leading receiver Gunner Romney had one catch for three yards. BYU’s defense finished with three sacks and 10 tackles for loss. Houston: The Cougars again struggled in the first quarter but rebounded in the second and third quarters to take the lead. Tune found 11 receivers but Houston’s leading receiver Marquez Stevenson was held to one reception for 19 yards. Houston committed 10 penalties for 113 yards. HE SAID IT “How many penalties did we have? Another 10. Yeah they ended up evening things out gave them some penalties too. Big 12 refs like to throw flags.” – Holgorsen on the officiating POLL IMPLICATIONS BYU should at least hold its position at No. 14 following the come-from-behind win. HARPER EJECTED BYU defensive back Micah Harper was ejected for targeting with 6 ½ minutes remaining in the third quarter after tackling Porter with the crown of his helmet. Following a lengthy review the targeting call was upheld. Porter was whistled for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after the play for headbutting Harper but remained in the game.

231,Wilson throws 4 TDs in No. 14 BYU's 43-26 win over Houston, EXCLUSIVE:  Andrew Farriss was set to deliver his latest full-length studio album until the coronavirus pandemic upended everything. The Australian rocker and co-founder of the band INXS told Fox News that right as the pandemic began halting shows and live events Farriss had released two songs from his self-titled album “Andrew Farriss” and was preparing to travel the world to promote it. But Farriss wouldn’t get the opportunity. He instead released “Love Makes the World” a five-song EP on Oct. 2 that features music fit for the current times. “The record company said 'Hey you can keep releasing songs if you want but everyone's going home. They're isolating. Everyone's confused'” Farriss 61 said. “And so like everybody else I started isolating and then I started making videos of myself in the living room or whatever. And as I was sort of walking around one day I started thinking this is not party time -- this is a really hard time for people in the world.” KENNY CHESNEY REFLECTS ON PERFORMING WITH EDDIE VAN HALEN: 'IT WAS SO ALIVE' Farriss said while deciding his next move he explored extra songs that he had recorded for his LP and realized many of the lyrics “all made sense” when arranging the tracklist. “I'm just like in the same boat as anybody else” said Farriss whose wife Marlina is an Ohio native and has been longing to travel from Australia back home to visit her family. STEVIE WONDER GIVES FANS HEALTH UPDATE AFTER KIDNEY TRANSPLANT: 'MY VOICE FEELS GREAT' “We're all still trying to work out how to come out of this thing” Farriss said. “And so many people have been affected by it with their family and friends. And some people are isolated from family and friends.” “I think that really hurt my wife” he lamented. “I think this is just a time in the world whether we like it or not ... [when] we need to really re-evaluate some of the more important things in our lives and the people closest to us and really have a good look at ourselves about what we're all about.” Farriss recalled a time when the band partied with Iggy Pop and Guns N’ Roses back in 1988 during a time he maintains was “a little less political and a little bit more fundamental.” “I hope we come out of it real soon and I hope it's party time again. But it just don't feel like that to me.

And John had lost a family member – his brother had passed away from sadly something similar to what Michael's experience was. “But for me as I've gone through life I like to think of the good things about Michael and there were some funny things about him” Farriss added. “He was a funny guy. And most of his life he was happy and upwardly mobile as a person. [He was] an amazing singer amazing performer and a great songwriting buddy of mine.

Crossley intercepted Tulane freshman Michael Pratt’s pass to put the Mustangs (5-0 3-0 American Athletic) in position to win with the field goal. “It’s good to get a hard-fought win” SMU coach Sonny Dykes said. “We had our hands full and we were really fortunate to win. It’s very difficult to be able to win a mid-week game on the road especially with all the problems that we created for ourselves. We just didn’t seem to be in sync on either side of the ball. We did a bunch of things that if you normally do you lose ball games. But we were able to win.” CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM SMU is 5-0 for the second straight season a feat it last accomplished in 1983. “Being able to accomplish what we have these last two years says we are getting better as a program” Dykes said. “When you take over a program you want to always try and get better. It’s a credit to the players for buying in and doing what we are asking them to do.” The Green Wave (2-3 0-3) rallied to force overtime on Merek Glover’s 27-yard field goal with 1:30 left. “We went blow for blow with them” Tulane coach Willie Fritz said. “Unfortunately they get the last one in. I saw a lot of good things from our guys. Really was impressed with the way we battled and fought back.” After Tulane took a 31-27 lead early in the fourth quarter on Pratt’s 7-yard touchdown the Mustangs pulled ahead 34-31 lead on Shane Buechele’s 10-yard pass to Danny Gray. Buechele completed 23 of 37 passes for 384 yards and two touchdowns. He entered the game second nationally in passing yards. Rashee Rice had seven receptions for 139 yards and a touchdown and Gray added five catches for 133 yards and a touchdown and had a 32-yard scoring run. Ulysses Bentley ran for 94 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. Tulane scored on its first possession of the game on Pratt’s 31-yard pass to Mykel Jones and its first possession of the second half on Stephon Huderson’s 22-yard run “I really appreciate the effort playing the 17th-ranked team in the country but we’re at the point in our program where we want to win those games"" Fritz said.

233,No.. 17 SMU beats Tulane 37-34 in OT to improve to 5-0, Although House Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed earlier this month that President Trump is “in an altered state right now” she is the one who appears to be in an “altered state” if she thinks she can use congressional authority under the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. It seems that having failed to remove Trump through the impeachment process Democrats led by Pelosi now want to try a different method. Pelosi claims that new legislation she is backing which would give a congressional commission authority to determine if a president is incapable in its “opinion” of carrying out his duties is “not about President Trump.” NEWT GINGRICH: DEMOCRATS PURSUE TRUMP WITH ZOMBIE IMPEACHMENT THAT NEVER DIES — IT JUST KEEPS COMING BACK No this “legislation applies to future presidents” Pelosi said although she added that she is taking this action because of the “health of the current president.” That is a revealing comment since despite Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis there is no evidence that he has been physically or mentally disabled from carrying out his duties. The issue here is that Pelosi and her Democratic colleagues don’t like the way Trump is carrying out those duties. This blatantly political move raises the issue of what exactly the 25th Amendment is — and what power Congress has under it. Can it be used to remove a president elected by the American people? The 25th Amendment ratified in 1967 outlines what happens if the office of the presidency becomes vacant because the president is removed (through impeachment) dies resigns or is temporarily or permanently “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” As the Heritage Guide to the Constitution explains the amendment was adopted because the original presidential succession clause contained in Article II Section 1 of the Constitution was ambiguous. It did not define what the meaning was of the “inability” of a president to discharge his duties or who makes that determination. Did the vice president who succeeded a president become president for the rest of the presidential term? Or was he merely the “acting president?” This important issue was not addressed in the Constitution before the adoption of the 25th Amendment. The 25th Amendment also provides that if the office of the vice president becomes vacant the president nominates a new vice president who can take office after being confirmed by both the House and Senate. This procedure was used when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned in 1973 and was replaced by then-House Minority Leader Gerald Ford. It was used again in 1974 when Ford became president following the resignation of President Richard Nixon and nominated former New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller to become vice president. Section 3 provides for the vice president to take over as “Acting President” if the president sends a “written declaration” to the Senate and the House that “he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” The vice president remains the acting president until the president sends notice to the Senate and House that he can once again assume his role as president. This provision has been invoked three times – once by President Ronald Reagan and twice by President George W. Bush – when the president handed the reins of power temporarily to the vice president while undergoing a minor medical procedure that required general anesthesia. Section 4 is the provision of the amendment under which Pelosi is attempting to assert congressional authority. It provides that when the “Vice President and a majority of either the principle officers of the executive departments or such other body as Congress may by law provide” send written notice to the Senate and the House that the president is “unable” to do his job the vice president shall become the acting president. The president can reclaim the duties of his office if he sends written notice that he is capable of being president unless the same group — the vice president and a majority either of his Cabinet or some other body set up by Congress — disagrees within four days. If that conflict arises Congress has to assemble within 48 hours and has 21 days to decide who is right. It takes a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress to override the president’s assertion that he can once again resume his duties as president. The bill Pelosi is supporting was drafted by Rep Jamie Raskin D-Md. and has 38 co-sponsors many of whom have expressed virulent opposition to President Trump. H.R. 8548 if enacted would establish the “other body as Congress may provide” in the form of a 17-member “Commission on Presidential Capacity” appointed by the leadership of Congress. The commission would be given the power to authorize medical examinations “to determine whether the President is mentally or physically unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office” when so directed by a resolution passed by Congress and to file a report giving its opinion on the capability of the president. However Congress has no constitutional authority to force the president to undergo a medical examination. Even if this commission were to believe that the president was unable to do his job it would still need the concurrence of the vice president in order to remove the president even temporarily. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER There is no reason to believe that such a commission would be in a better position to judge the president’s ability to carry out his duties than the members of the president’s own Cabinet who work with him. The fact remains that Section 4 of the 25th Amendment would not be invoked unless something happens — like a heart attack or a stroke — that actually incapacitates the president. Contrary to what some liberals seem to believe the 25th Amendment — as Professor John Feerick explains in the Heritage Guide — was not intended to be used to “cover political and policy differences or poor judgment incompetence laziness” or other such issues or criticisms that a president’s political opposition may have over his conduct as president. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The amendment was also not intended as a substitute for an unsuccessful attempt to remove a president through the impeachment process. There is no need to change the current procedures that already exist under the 25th Amendment. This bill is nothing more than a political stunt and a waste of time.

234,Hans von Spakovsky: Pelosi bill to remove president from office is a needless political stunt, More than 35000 Arizona residents signed up to vote during a 10-day extension of the state's voter registration deadline.  More Republicans registered than Democrats even though the extension was sought by progressive advocacy groups and the GOP argued in court to cut off registration. TRUMP BIDEN FUNNEL AD DOLLARS INTO KEY BATTLEGROUNDS IN FINAL STRETCH About 44% of the new voters did not affiliate with either major political party according to the Secretary of State's Office. Initial data showed almost 11000 voters registered as Republicans nearly 8300 registered as Democrats and about 500 as Libertarians. More than 15400 voters registered without affiliating with any of those parties. A federal judge extended the registration deadline beyond Oct. 5 after two advocacy groups Arizona Coalition for Change and Mi Familia Vota argued that the COVID-19 pandemic had impeded efforts to register voters. The decision by Judge Steven P. Logan sparked a legal battle that resulted in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cutting off registration on Oct. 15. Arizona Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and the Republican National Committee all argued that the sudden change had raised a series of problems for election officials. The count is not yet final as election officials continued to process voter registration forms Friday that were submitted on paper the Arizona Republic reported. The advocacy organizations said the numbers of newly registered voters within that short timeframe vindicated their claims.  Early voting is already underway in Arizona and President Trump is set to host two rallies in the state on Monday according to his campaign. With less than three weeks until Election Day national polling has shown Democratic challenger Joe Biden leading narrowly in the usually-red Sun Belt state.  The latest Real Clear Politics average has the former vice president up by 4 percentage points.  CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Arizona is also a state to watch for Democrats hoping to regain a Senate majority come November.

236,3 injured after building explosion in Virginia, Seven Chicago police officers have been disciplined for their actions the night the city’s top cop was found passed out behind the wheel of his department-issued SUV. The cops were punished with suspensions according to the Chicago inspector general who found that then-superintendent Eddie Johnson downed the equivalent of 10 rum drinks that night. The officers punished for their response to the incident include a district commander Don Jerome and a lieutenant public radio station WBEZ reported Friday. OFFICER SUES FORMER CHICAGO TOP COP EDDIE JOHNSON FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT Jerome was suspended for 28 days for failing to report misconduct and the lieutenant was suspended for 21 days according to the station. The police department suspended the lieutenant after rejecting a recommendation from IG Joseph Ferguson that the officer be fired for lying about the incident the station reported. “Multiple sworn CPD personnel failed to effectively carry out their duties in compliance with policy in the handling and aftermath” of the incident the report says. CHICAGO POLICE SUPERINTENDENT EDDIE JOHNSON FIRED BY MAYOR LORI LIGHTFOOT While stopping short of finding the officers engaged in a cover-up Ferguson concluded that the officers’ “actions created the impression of giving the superintendent preferential treatment.” The report's release came a year to the day of the incident which ultimately led to Johnson’s firing by Mayor Lori Lightfoot for lying about it. It also comes a day after Johnson’s former driver Cynthia Donald who was drinking with him that night filed a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against Johnson.

237,7 Chicago officers suspended in scandal involving disgraced former top cop Eddie Johnson," The dueling “town hall” events on ABC and NBC on Thursday night featuring the two 2020 presidential candidates former Vice President Joe Biden and President Trump once again underlined that whatever romantic attachment voters have to the “town hall” concept on television is no longer warranted. These network events are heavily pre-screened pre-scripted and pre....dictable. And whenever they are exposed for making “mistakes” it's always a mistake in favor of Biden.  In a real town hall people get up in somewhat random order and just unfurl what’s on their mind. The networks think the stakes are far too high to walk that tightrope especially in an age where social-media troublemakers can take anything viral and the entire Democratic establishment is petrified Joe Biden could spontaneously combust in a horrible gaffe. As FoxNews.com has reported two of ABC’s Biden questioners had ties to Democrats. One was a speechwriter in the Obama administration. The other presented as a physical therapist was the wife of a high-profile Pennsylvania Democrat. BIDEN'S ABC TOWN HALL QUESTIONERS INCLUDE FORMER OBAMA SPEECHWRITER WIFE OF FORMER PENNSYLVANIA DEM CANDIDATE How hard is it for the networks to do some elementary Google searches before choosing their questioners? Or are these choices carefully planned and they hide these partisan identities hoping their “mistake” won’t be discovered? This also happened at ABC's town hall for Donald Trump. Kutztown University professor Ellesia Blaque a woman ABC repeatedly identified as ""uncommitted"" in its coverage of the town hall complained at length about the need for ObamaCare. The Washington Free Beacon found that on social media she praised vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris during the primaries saying she would ""be there volunteering"" for the California senator in Pennsylvania. TRUMP DEBATES MODERATOR WHILE BIDEN GETS COVER FROM MAINSTREAM MEDIA: JOE CONCHA The English professor was not shy about her loathing of the president calling Trump a ""f—ing moron"" ""pathetic"" ""pig"" ""swine"" and ""punk ass."" But after the ABC event CNN's Brian Stelter extended the charade by quoting ""undecided"" Professor Blaque claiming Trump had powerfully ""reanimated"" her into voting for Biden. At NBC’s Biden “town hall” on October 5 I quickly discovered several of the so-called “independent voters” Lester Holt was touting could be identified as Biden supporters by just searching their names and towns. TIM GRAHAM: NBC TOWN HALL TOSSES BIDEN SOFTBALL QUESTIONS FROM HIS FANS Their overtly pro-Biden or pro-abortion questions also made you scoff at the idea they were undecided. If the networks see these questions beforehand they're not even trying to make them sound more ""undecided."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER After the debate Ingrid Gilliam-Alexander posted her appearance on her LinkedIn page the hashtag “#joebiden2020.” Cassidy Brown posted “Vote Pro-Choice” memes on her Facebook page. Michelle Cruz Marrero was easily found on the Facebook page “Cubanos con Biden” gushing that “Biden was eloquent...He is intelligent. He is elegant. He is poised and he has a plan....We need Biden....He will save America and he will restore the country we had before this monster took over.” Worse yet the Washington Free Beacon found two of the male “undecided voters” had appeared on MSNBC a few months ago identified on-screen as Biden supporters! So when NBC booked Trump for their town hall on Thursday producers dropped the word “undecided” from the menu.  But the voters almost vanished from the picture. There was so much outrage inside the walls of NBC that moderator Savannah Guthrie took over the event. As someone complained to me on Twitter ""This wasn't a town hall. It was a hostile interview with spectators that were periodically allowed to chime in."" Hill media reporter Joe Concha says that his review of the transcript showed Guthrie asked President Trump 43 questions and the voters were only granted ten. He noted this did not count her many interruptions to just make statements like yelling at him ""you're the president you're not someone's crazy uncle!""  In this case none of these sparsely used voters were easily exposed as something other than how they were presented by NBC. Ever since the Commission on Presidential Debates started using a ""town hall"" format in 1992 we at the Media Research Center have found the networks have almost uniformly tilted the debates in favor of questioners who supported the Democrats and the liberal agenda. The only exception was 2008 when ABC's Charles Gibson managed to balance it at eight and eight. Even if there had been a ""town hall"" debate with both Trump and Biden present it's quite likely that it would be another loaded event against the Republicans. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In other words it's just as biased as a normal debate with a ""mainstream media"" moderator but it carries that annoying illusion that it's offering viewers a random assortment of voters with their random thoughts about politics.

240,Man pleads not guilty to trying to kill 2 Los Angeles officers," Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has vetoed bills that would have made it a felony to apply for multiple absentee ballots or fill out an application for others without their consent.  Voter fraud is already a crime the Democrat said and the Republican-backed legislation would “muddy the waters” and “likely confuse voters” about what is considered criminal. MICHIGAN BANS OPEN CARRY OF GUNS AT POLLING LOCATIONS In a letter to lawmakers Friday the governor said it is impossible to get a second ballot without spoiling the first one and pointed out that voters might submit multiple ballot applications due to memory or error. “Any suggestion that the filing of a second absentee ballot application is criminal behavior creates needless confusion and fearmongering around the absentee voting process” she wrote. “It is bad for voters and bad for our elections."" The main bill was passed by the Republican-controlled House and Senate with bipartisan votes of 77-26 and 32-6 respectively according to The Associated Press. Whimter's veto drew heavy criticism from one of the bills' sponsors GOP Rep. Ann Bollin who said the legislation would have deterred fraud and enhanced voters’ confidence in elections amid “noise” about mail-in voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. President Trump has added to the din raising his own questions about the integrity of mail voting. Election experts however generally say all forms of voter fraud are rare. According to Bolin the legislation had ""nothing"" to do with voters who fill out multiple applications or ballots themselves. “This legislation would have created a felony penalty for someone who fills out an application for another person in an attempt to commit fraud” she said. “That’s not voter intimidation – it’s voter protection.” According to polling data included in the Real Clear Politics average voters in the swing state are leaning toward former Vice President Joe Biden.

241,Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoes 'fearmongering' bill targeting voter fraud," A suspect shot dead by police after the gruesome beheading of a history teacher in an attack near Paris was an 18-year-old Moscow-born Chechen refugee officials said Saturday. France's anti-terrorism prosecutor's office said authorities investigating the killing of Samuel Paty in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine on Friday also arrested nine suspects including the teen's grandfather parents and 17-year-old brother. Paty had discussed caricatures of Islam's Prophet Muhammad with his class leading to threats and a complaint from a parent police officials said. Islam prohibits images of the prophet asserting that they lead to idolatry. The officials could not be named because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing investigations. The French anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said an investigation for murder with a suspected terrorist motive had been opened. Ricard told reporters that the suspect who had been granted a 10-year residency in France as a refugee in March and was not known to intelligence services had been armed with a knife and an airsoft gun which fires plastic pellets. FRENCH MOB ATTACKS POLICE STATION WITH FIREWORKS METAL BARS The prosecutor said a text claiming responsibility and a photograph of the victim were found on the suspect's phone. Ricard said the suspect had been seen at the school asking students about the teacher and the headmaster had received several threatening phone calls. French leaders offered messages of sadness but also of hope after the killing. ""We'll pick ourselves up together thanks to our spirit of solidarity"" said Laurent Brosse mayor of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine. ""We are all affected all touched by this vile assassination"" said Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer in a video message. Mourners marched near the school in solidarity holding signs that read ""I am a teacher."" A police official said the suspect was shot dead about 600 meters (yards) from where Paty died. Police opened fire after he failed to respond to orders to put down his arms and acted in a threatening manner. The official could not be named because of the ongoing investigations. French President Emmanuel Macron went to the school on Friday night to denounce what he called an ""Islamist terrorist attack."" He urged the nation to stand united against extremism. ""One of our compatriots was murdered today because he taught ... the freedom of expression the freedom to believe or not believe"" Macron said. The presidential Elysee Palace announced Saturday that there will be a national ceremony at a future date in homage to Paty about whom few details have so far emerged. BIGGEST WWII BOMB FOUND IN POLAND EXPLODES WHILE DIVERS TRY TO DIFFUSE IT In a video posted recently on Twitter a man describing himself as the father of a student asserted that Paty had shown an image of a naked man and told students it was ""the prophet of the Muslims."" Before showing the images the teacher asked Muslim children to raise their hands and leave the room because he planned to show something shocking the man said. ""What was the message he wanted to send these children? What is this hate?"" the man asked. The AP has not been able to independently confirm these claims. Chechnya is a predominantly Muslim Russian republic in the North Caucasus. Two wars in the 1990s triggered a wave of emigration with many Chechens heading for western Europe. France has offered asylum to many Chechens since the Russian military waged war against Islamist separatists in Chechnya in the 1990s and early 2000s. France has seen occasional violence involving its Chechen community in recent months believed linked to local criminal activity and score-settling. This is the second time in three weeks that terror has struck France linked to caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. Last month a young man from Pakistan was arrested after attacking two people with a meat cleaver outside the former offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The weekly was the target of a deadly newsroom attack in 2015 and it republished caricatures of the prophet this month to underscore the right to freedom of information as a trial opened linked to that attack. Friday's terror attack came as Macron's government works on a bill to address Islamic radicals who authorities claim are creating a parallel society outside the values of the French Republic.

""Court packing” is not normally used to refer to filling vacancies although a number of Democrats have attempted to use that term to describe the process in recent weeks. Instead it has traditionally referred to potential politically motiviated plans to expand the number of justices on the court. It was attempted unsuccessfully by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1937 to force through parts of his New Deal that were ruled unconstitutional by the high court and has been a fringe idea for years. It has been condemned in the past by both Biden and Ginsburg. BIDEN IS SILENT NOW ON COURT-PACKING BUT IN 1983 HE CALLED IT A 'BONEHEAD' IDEA The notion however has gained traction on the left since Republicans refused to hold hearings for Barack Obama nominee Merrick Garland in 2016. A number of Democrats in the presidential primary backed court packing although Biden rejected the idea at the time. In recent days Biden has been evasive on the subject. Last week he said “no they don’t” when asked if voters deserve to know his stance. This week he changed his tone and said voters “do have a right to know where I stand.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But in the interview with Fox 2 Detroit he did not give a clear answer when asked when court packing might be appropriate. “As you know I've not been a fan of packing the court but what might happen is that we have to take a look at how this all works out and determine whether there's other means by which we should take a look at how to make sure that this kind of thing doesn’t happen” he said.

243,Biden will 'make clear' his position on court packing when Senate votes on Amy Coney Barrett, All eyes are turning to NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker as she prepares to host the third and final presidential debate Thursday. President Trump and Joe Biden will square off at Belmont University in Nashville Tenn. in a 90-minute debate starting at 9 p.m. Welker 44 has been the White House correspondent at NBC News since 2011 after working as a news reporter in Rhode Island. But Trump supporters who took issue with hard questioning by previous moderators like Chris Wallace and Savannah Guthrie may find themselves pining for those combative hosts after Welker is done with the president. JON VOIGHT SLAMS BIDEN SAYS TRUMP 'MUST WIN' ELECTION Welker comes from an established Democratic family — who have poured cash into party coffers and to Trump opponents for years. Her mother Julie Welker a prominent real estate broker in Philadelphia and father Harvey Welker a consulting engineer have donated tens of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and close to $20000 to Barack Obama alone. There was also $3300 for Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign and $2100 for Hillary Clinton’s doomed 2016 presidential effort against Trump. Another $7300 was contributed to the Democratic National Committee between 2004 and 2020. In 2012 Welker and her family celebrated Christmas at the White House with the Obamas. Though Kristen Welker’s party registration is not listed today she was a registered Democrat in Washington DC in 2012 and in Rhode Island in 2004. Throughout Welker’s tenure as a White House correspondent she has earned a reputation for a scathing style of questioning. “Mr. President yes or no. … have you ever worked for Russia. Yes or no?” she demanded during a confrontation in January 2019. BIDEN FALSELY CLAIMS UNION ENDORSEMENT DURING ABC TOWN HALL The treatment stands in stark contrast to her handling of Democratic politicos. In March 2016 Welker was busted on live television tipping off Hillary Clinton’s Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri about at least one question she planned to ask her during a post-debate interview in Michigan. At the time Clinton was locked in a fierce fight for the Democratic nomination against Sen. Bernie Sanders. “I’m going to ask you about Flint” Welker said of the Michigan city’s infamous water crisis. Welker deleted her Twitter account last week heading off a more complete look at her past statements and views. It was later restored. “Anyone who’s ever dealt with Welker knows she’s an activist not a reporter. The White House press team views her the same way they would AOC or Pelosi if they walked in the office” a senior White House official told The Post. , https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kristen-welker-upcoming-presidential-debate-moderator-has-deep-democrat-ties,0.8103299574284056
244,Kristen Welker upcoming presidential debate moderator has deep Democrat ties, Focus on public policy! This is what I have done and advised others to do since Donald J. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Some people including otherwise intelligent and thoughtful free-market and cultural conservatives cannot tolerate Trump’s larger-than-life persona his often grandiose statements his Twitter blasts and the sneaking suspicion that he might be the reincarnation of P.T. Barnum. Some Americans find the president’s quirks and conduct amusing. Others are appalled. President Trump’s antics make me grin more than they make me grimace Regardless I focus on public policy: What legislation has he signed? What has he vetoed? Do his actions as president make Americans freer safer and more prosperous? Do America’s enemies advance or retreat in his presence? NEWT GINGRICH: TRUMP'S COMPOSURE VS. GUTHRIE'S ALMOST MANIACAL HOSTILITY AT NBC'S TOWN HALL TELLS US THIS As voters pick the Oval Office’s next occupant they should imagine it’s Christmas morning. A large mysterious box sits beneath a shimmering tree. Is it covered in soothing lovely wrapping paper or in months-old newsprint? Who cares? The box’s contents matter. Former vice president Joe Biden generally exudes a vaguely calming tone. His empathetic demeanor perhaps forced by multiple family tragedies also amplifies his appeal. For some people that’s plenty. They especially Republicans in their midst should meditate long and hard on what Biden actually would do as president. While Biden might seem warmer and toastier than Trump his public policy will be colder than Siberia if he shutters Washington D.C.’s school voucher program as threatened. Biden’s vaunted compassion will be lost on thousands of poor mainly Black kids who would have no choice but to return to often-dangerous reliably dysfunctional government schools. While their minds would be crushed Biden’s teachers-union masters would cheer. They detest competition. Conversely a second Trump term promises school choice for every parent. President Trump has created 8700 Opportunity Zones largely in low-income minority neighborhoods. Incentives have attracted some $75 billion in private investment to these communities. If Biden kills the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as he has pledged wave goodbye to Opportunity Zones. Biden hopes to grant citizenship to 11 million illegal aliens. Most of them likely would vote Democrat. This would steepen GOP election prospects. Free healthcare for illegal aliens? Biden’s prescription is malpractice for an already overburdened medical system and a morbidly obese federal budget. Biden now claims he “will not ban fracking.” While this could become his “Read my lips: No new taxes” moment he could keep this promise while also pleasing keeping his fossil-fuel-loathing far-Left base. Why kill fracking when you simply can study it nearly to death as Obama-Biden did the Keystone Pipeline? Thankfully President Trump greenlighted that pipeline. Indeed from the left’s perspective it’s better not to kill projects. Doing so creates bad headlines and entrepreneurs can move on with their lives. Instead Team Biden might say: “Please conduct a study on your program’s impact on the Endangered Species Act.”  Two years and $3 million later it could be “Hmmmm. Interesting. Now tell us what your plan will do to Native American burial grounds.” And then “Please forecast damage to fossils...clean air...urban sprawl.” If the potential frackers have not surrendered Biden-Harris would deliver the coup de grace: “Please detail your initiative’s impact on racial justice.” Far better from the left’s view to bog down disfavored businesses with these demands and slowly leech them white than slap them with a swift “No!” and let them relocate their dreams and undepleted capital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER President Trump delivered American energy independence largely through fracking. Biden would reverse this achievement in favor of habitat-chewing solar panels and eagle-shredding windmills. While President Trump proposes patriotic education and Americanism in U.S. classrooms Biden-Harris most likely would set the anti-American 1619 Project on a fast track via the Department of Education. After Trump ditched Critical Race Theory training within federal agencies Biden-Harris would resurrect it in the U.S. government and perhaps impose it on the private sector. As happened recently at the federal Sandia Laboratories white males would be subjected to mandatory re-education sessions where they would be denounced as racists and forced to apologize for being born white. “I will end the Muslim ban on Day One” Biden said. This policy does not ban Muslims. Rather it limits arrivals by foreigners who have traveled through several nations designated by Obama-Biden as either tainted by terror or hobbled by insufficient security standards. Biden would throw the Golden Door open to these travelers some from nations that sponsor terrorism. What could go wrong? And among other planned blunders a President Biden would revive the Iran Nuclear Deal. Appeasing the ayatollahs surely will unravel the growing Middle East peace that President Trump has orchestrated by isolating Tehran. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Voters are free to reject President Trump’s eccentricities. But if Joe Biden prevails the ensuing far-left agenda will be the steep price that 330 million Americans pay to satisfy the Trump haters’ burning desire never to see his face again.

The Astros still have a hill to climb to get past Tampa Bay on Saturday night and they won’t be as lucky to leave their past behind them just yet. The shadow of the Astros’ cheating scandal still looms large for baseball fans. Houston was found to have been using a camera in center field at Minute Maid Park and using a trash can as a signal to tip batters off on when a breaking ball was coming during the 2017 season in which they won the World Series. ASTROS' CARLOS CORREA PREDICTED WALK-OFF HOME RUN AGAINST RAYS IN GAME 5 MANAGER SAYS Former general manager Jeff Luhnow former manager A.J. Bench and former bench coach Alex Cora were all disciplined in the issue with Luhnow and Hinch getting suspended for a year while Cora lost his job with the Boston Red Sox. Carlos Beltran who was the only player on the roster implicated resigned from his New York Mets managerial gig without ever seeing a game. Carlos Correa has said the scandal was not used as motivation. “We never gave up because we had a down year offensively. We kept going to the cage.

VERMONT MAIL-IN VOTING: WHAT TO KNOW Lefler whose postcard accused her of ""refusing to accept input from citizens on public matters"" said she reported it to Capitol Police.  ""This morning around 5 [a.m.] I woke up to a gunshot"" she continued in her Thursday post. ""My porch camera caught a couple seconds of a car driving by my house with the same distinct sound of a shot. The only un-American behavior I can find is someone that prefers anonymous threats and scare tactics over working with me on the issues.""

256,Another Vermont lawmaker receives postcard alleging 'un-American' activity," San Francisco Mayor London Breed on Friday hit out at the city’s school district for beginning a process of renaming schools under its control rather than reopening them. “Conversations around school names can be had once the critical work of educating our young people in person is underway” Breed said in a statement. “Once that is happening then we can talk about everything else. Until those doors are open the School Board and the District should be focused on getting out kids back in the classroom.” SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR SLAMS 'RECKLESS AND SELFISH' CROWD OF 1000 CELEBRATING BURNING MAN ON BEACH Breed was reacting to a move by the San Francisco School Names Advisory Committee which has reportedly researched school names and identified certain ones for renaming.  According to the San Francisco Chronicle some of the schools listed under the proposed name changes included Abraham Lincoln High School George Washington High School Roosevelt Middle School and Jefferson Elementary. According to the paper certain criteria by the committee included: ""Anyone directly involved in the colonization of people those connected to any human rights or environmental abuses slave owners or participants in enslavement and known racists and/or white supremacists and/or espoused racist beliefs."" Included was a recommendation to change the name of Dianne Feinstein Elementary which honors the current U.S. Senator and former mayor of San Francisco because she reportedly replaced a vandalized Confederate flag back in 1986. But Breed noted that while schools have been allowed to open in San Francisco and many private schools have done just that so far the public schools have not. “Parents are frustrated and looking for answers. The achievement gap is widening as our public school kids are falling further behind every single day” she said. “And now in the mindset of this once in a century challenge to hear that the District is focusing energy and resources on renaming schools -- schools that they haven’t even opened -- is offensive” she said.  “It’s offensive to parents who are juggling their children’s daily at-home learning schedules with doing their own jobs and maintaining their sanity. It’s offensive to me as someone who went to public schools who loves our public schools and who knows how those years in the classroom are what lifted me out of poverty and into college. It’s offensive to our kids who are staring at screens day after day instead of learning and growing with their classmates and friends” she added.

Unless the 2020 presidential election is a landslide for either President Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden results will likely not be clear until days -- or even weeks -- after Nov. 3. ""Although ... factors may complicate plaintiffs’ voting process they do not automatically amount to a loss of the right to vote absentee"" the court said in its decision. Hundreds of special absentee-ballot voting boxes have been set up across the state. Initially Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens had ruled that ballots postmarked by Nov. 2 can still be counted if they are received two weeks after Nov. 3 citing ""unrefuted evidence"" about mail delivery problems because of the coronavirus pandemic. She said more than 6400 ballots arrived too late to be counted in the August primary. MICHIGAN BANS OPEN CARRY OF GUNS AT POLLING PLACES The appeals court however said the pandemic and any delivery woes “are not attributable to the state.” The coronavirus pandemic has prompted record absentee ballots requests across the country; some states sent absentee ballots to all registered voters. Nearly 1.4 million Michiganders have submitted early ballots less than three weeks away from Election Day or 28.7% of the state's total 2016 voter turnout according to data from the United States Elections Project. CASE AGAINST WHITMER KIDNAPPING SUSPECTS CAN MOVE TO TRIAL JUDGE RULES Some legislators feared that changes to the U.S. Postal Service put in place by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy months before the election could potentially delay delivery service and therefore ballot-counting processes. DeJoy assured voters in an Aug. 18 statement that the USPS ""is ready today to handle whatever volume of election mail it receives this fall."" He has since postponed the changes. “Happy to see this unanimous ruling to uphold the integrity of our elections process and reject judicial overreach” Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey tweeted. The Michigan Democratic Party was disappointed. “Voters should not be punished for delays in the U.S. Postal Service or for unexpected emergencies that could make it a challenge for them to get to the polls on Election Day” the party said.

""[T]he reality is that this race is far closer than some of the punditry we’re seeing on Twitter and on TV would suggest"" Dillon wrote in the memo obtained by Fox News.  Dillon cautioned that polling showing Biden ahead may not be accurate.

""We need to campaign like we are trailing"" the memo said.  “If we learned anything from 2016 it’s that we cannot underestimate Donald Trump or his ability to claw his way back into contention in the final days of a campaign through whatever smears or underhanded tactics he has at his disposal"" Dillon wrote.  BIDEN ONCE AGAIN SHATTERS FUNDRAISING RECORD WITH SECOND STRAIGHT EYE-POPPING HAUL Dillon's state-of-the-race memo outlined what's positive in the Biden campaign in the final days of the election including Biden's financial advantage nearly 3500 staff working to organize in battleground states and the ""largest and best-resourced vote protection program in history."" She said while Biden's campaign has spent more than any presidential campaign in history on advertising the advantages could be instantly wiped away if more billionaires write checks to pro-Trump super PACs.

She was 97. Fleming’s assistant Carla Sapon told The New York Times that Fleming died Wednesday in Santa Monica California. From her first film in color “A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court ” (1949) with Bing Crosby Fleming became immensely popular with producers because of her vivid hues. It was an attraction she would later regret. “Suddenly my green eyes were green. My red hair was flaming red. My skin was porcelain white” Fleming remarked in a 1990 interview. “There was suddenly all this attention on how I looked rather than the roles I was playing. CHADWICK BOSEMAN'S WIDOW FILES PROBATE CASE AFTER ACTOR DIED WITHOUT A WILL “I’d been painted into a corner by the studios who never wanted more from me than my looking good and waltzing through a parade of films like 'The Redhead and the Cowboy.' ” Before Reagan entered politics the actress co-starred with him in “Hong Kong” “Tropic Zone” “The Last Outpost” and “Tennessee’s Partner.” “He surprised everyone because he never looked in a mirror” she once said of Reagan. “How many actors can you say that about?” Fleming possessed a fine singing voice and later in her career sang onstage in Las Vegas and in a touring act. In the big-studio era many new personalities were publicized as having been discovered in quirky ways: Kim Novak while riding a bicycle past an agent’s office Lana Turner in a malt shop. In Fleming’s case young Marilyn Louis was reported to have been headed to class at Beverly Hills High School when a man followed her in a big black car and told her “You ought to be in pictures.” She eluded him but he turned up at her home and offered to be her agent. RON ELY CHALLENGES SANTA BARBARA DISTRICT ATTORNEY AFTER FATAL SHOOTING OF HIS SON DEEMED 'JUSTIFIABLE' At 19 Louis was awarded a six-month contract at the studio of David O. Selznick and a new name: Rhonda Fleming. She played a bit part in the 1944 wartime drama “Since You Went Away” and then Alfred Hitchcock chose her to play a nymphomaniac in “Spellbound” starring Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck. “I rushed home and my mother and I looked up ‘nymphomaniac’ in the dictionary” she recalled. “We were both shocked.” “Spellbound” led to another suspense film “The Spiral Staircase” in which she was strangled by the villain George Brent. With Selznick concentrating on the career of his wife Jennifer Jones he lost interest in his contract players and Fleming left the studio to freelance. Her next films: “Abilene Town” a Randolph Scott Western; “Out of the Past” a film noir with Robert Mitchum; and “Adventure Island” a tropics thriller starring Rory Calhoun. DAVID BOWIE WAS ‘A CHEERFUL SOUL’ PHOTOGRAPHER SAYS: ‘HE CAME TO PLAY’ She won a role in “A Connecticut Yankee” a Crosby musical based on the Mark Twain story after Deanna Durbin dropped out to retire to France. Crosby was so impressed that he recommended her to Bob Hope with whom she starred in “The Great Lover.” Ironically the Crosby/Hope films that established her as a luminary proved to be ones she was never able to top. She remained a star for 15 years but except for the Lancaster-Douglas “Gunfight at the OK Corral” most of her performances came in B pictures that exploited her looks. “I made the mistake of doing lesser films for good money” she reflected in a 1976 interview. “I was hot — they all wanted me — but I didn’t have the guidance or background to judge for myself.” Among her 1950s films were “While the City Sleeps” directed by Fritz Lang and co-starring Dana Andrews. She played Cleopatra in the 1953 film “Serpent of the Nile.” But many titles were forgettable: “The Eagle and the Hawk” “The Last Outpost” “Little Egypt” “The Killer Is Loose” “Slightly Scarlet” “Crosswinds” and “Pony Express” (with Charlton Heston) “Inferno” “Those Redheads from Seattle” “Yankee Pasha” and “Gun Glory.” SAINT DOG KOTTONMOUTH KINGS RAPPER AND CO-FOUNDER DEAD AT 44 After her film career cooled off Fleming took a singing act to Las Vegas appeared in TV shows and commercials starred on Broadway in a revival of “The Women” and sang as the temptress Lalume in “Kismet” for the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera. She was born in Los Angeles in 1923. Her mother Effie Graham had appeared in a 1914 Broadway musical with Al Jolson and her grandfather was a theatrical producer in Salt Lake City. She studied acting but as a backup also took classes in shorthand typing and bookkeeping. While still in her teens Fleming married her high school sweetheart Thomas Lane. A son Kent was born in 1941. When Lane returned from Army service Rhonda had become a star and the marriage ended in 1947. Three other marriages also ended in divorce to Beverly Hills surgeon Lewis Morrill (1952-1958); actor Lang Jeffries (1960-1962); and producer-director Hall Bartlett (1966-1972). In 1977 Fleming married mogul Ted Mann who built the Mann Theater chain and the marriage lasted until his death in 2001. For many years they lived in matching 4300-square-foot condominiums one on top of the other in a Century City high-rise. “I treasure my privacy and Ted needs his” she once explained. “We love each other very much.

271,Canada restaurant owner moved to tears by $700 tip on $43 wine bottle purchase," In the regularly blue state of Oregon voters in a purple district near the city of Portland are turning away from long-term Democratic incumbent Rep. Peter DeFazio in favor of a young Republican challenger.  Army veteran Alek Skarlatos 27 gained international fame for halting an extremist attack aboard a Paris-bound train in 2015. He's also one of House Republicans' best recruits this year outraising DeFazio by $1.2 million and outspending him by over $900000 in the most recent quarter. PORTLAND MACHETE-WIELDING MAN ARRESTED AFTER STABBING NEIGHBOR: POLICE ""I can’t outspend him. We can’t even match him. He raised more money in a quarter than I’ve ever raised in a year in my life"" DeFazio admitted to supporters on a virtual phone call this week. ""But we can outwork him."" DeFazio a populist progressive is a key player for his party and would be an important figure on infrastructure should Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden win the White House. He's also been instrumental in Congress's coronavirus stimulus package discussions as a strong proponent for airline relief. While Politico reported Friday that the 73-year-old Democrat is expected to hold onto his seat and DeFazio retains the advantage with an enormous $2.12 million in cash on hand leadership has allegedly grown nervous over the slim margin. DeFazio has a history of winning but Skarlatos marks the first serious opponent the House Transportation chair has faced in years. DeFazio's backers say he has taken the challenge seriously and that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has taken note of the race. But Politico noted they also acknowledge there are additional unforeseen variables this election cycle. Devastating wildfires the absence of college students due to the COVID-19 pandemic and chaotic protests turned violent in nearby Portland will all play a part in shaping the race.  In addition Oregon's fourth district came just a fraction of a percentage point away from supporting President Trump four years ago.  Forecasters have recently shifted the race from likely to lean Democrat setting Skarlatos within striking distance. As a celebrity GOP candidate who competed on ""Dancing with the Stars"" Skarlatos has tried to put DeFazio on the defense. Despite the Democrat's independent image -- breaking with Democrats on several issues -- Skarlatos has hit the lawmaker's support for the Green New Deal. The ex-National Guardsman has also accused DeFazio of wanting to defund the police. “I do think people in Oregon are seeing it up and close and personal unlike a lot of people in the country” Mike Leavitt the lead consultant for the Skarlatos campaign told reporters in an interview about the national conversation on police reform. “I do think that is an issue that resonates with them.” Leavitt later said that he believed support for his candidate came from interest in a ""new face"" and ""new ideas."" In response Democrats have accused Skarlatos of loyally backing President Trump without question and hoping to dismantle healthcare protections. The congressional race is on track to be the most expensive in Oregonian history with Republicans spending $1.5 million on ads and Democrats shelling out $2.65 million. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP DeFazio is not the only Democratic incumbent to face tough reelection prospects this year.  House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney D-N.Y. was part of a race that took weeks to count and certify and 6-term incumbent House Foreign Affairs Chair Eliot Engel D-N.Y. was ultimately defeated by liberal challenger Jamaal Bowman.

276,Clemson's Trevor Lawrence tosses 5 touchdown passes in first half vs. Georgia Tech, Here is the likely timetable for the prospective confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. As is custom the committee is holding the nomination over for a week. The Senate Judiciary Committee will again meet to consider Barrett’s nomination at 1 pm ET on Thursday Oct. 22. FAITH AND FAMILY: A LOOK AT JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT The committee will vote to send the nomination to the floor (technically the “calendar” but that’s another story). A nominee does not have to have a “favorable” recommendation from the committee to go to the floor. Robert Bork received an “unfavorable” recommendation from the committee in 1987 (and was defeated on the floor). Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was sent to the floor with “no recommendation” in 1991 before being confirmed. The committee will need a simple majority vote to advance the nomination to the full Senate. WHERE DOES AMY CONEY BARRETT STAND ON KEY ISSUES? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. announced earlier this week that he would put the nomination on the floor on Friday Oct. 23. Here’s where it gets a little tricky. If the committee finishes the nomination on Oct. 22 the Senate can’t formally consider it until Oct. 23. Keep in mind that could begin at 12:00:01 a.m. ET Friday if McConnell really wants to hit the gas pedal. BARRETT WON'T SAY IF ROE V. WADE WAS WRONGLY DECIDED: 'I DON'T HAVE ANY AGENDA' McConnell must move to shift the Senate into executive session (versus legislative session) to specifically consider the Barrett nomination. Such a process likely requires a vote -- but is not debatable (subject to a filibuster). That vote could be by roll call a voice vote or by unanimous consent (so long as there is no objection by any senator). Democrats could create some mischief at this stage by not having a quorum present or demanding a quorum be present -- but not helping constitute a quorum. LARGELY CIVIL BARRETT CONFIRMATION HEARINGS BREAK EXPECTATIONS MARK STARK CONTRAST TO 2018 KAVANAUGH AFFAIR This step to go to executive session requires a simple majority. And once the Senate is in executive session for Barrett the clerk “reports” (reads aloud) the nomination before this Senate. There is no “motion to proceed” on this type of nomination based on a precedent set in the late 1970s by the late Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd D-W.V. Thus there is no way Democrats could filibuster just starting debate on the nomination. However Democrats could try to filibuster on the back end. At this stage McConnell could file cloture to curb debate and overcome a filibuster. McConnell could do this as early as Friday Oct. 23. SENATORS CLASH AT BARRETT CONFIRMATION HEARINGS AS DEMS ATTEMPT PROCEDURAL ROADBLOCKS GOP FORGES AHEAD Regardless of when McConnell files cloture by rule the “cloture petition” (to end debate on the nomination) ripens for a vote after an intervening day. So if McConnell files cloture to end debate on Friday Oct. 23 then Saturday Oct. 24 is the intervening day. The cloture petition would ripen on Sunday Oct. 25. By rule the Senate can begin voting to end debate on the nomination one hour after the Senate meets following the intervening day. Again if they really want to hit the gas this could happen at 1 a.m. ET on Sunday Oct. 25. GRAHAM SAYS 'NOTHING UNCONSTITUTIONAL' ABOUT AMY CONEY BARRETT CONFIRMATION DESPITE DEM ARGUMENTS But we don’t know that they will move that expeditiously. It’s more likely the Senate votes to end debate on the nomination on Monday Oct. 26 or later in the week. Under the provisions of “Nuclear Option II” (where McConnell established a new precedent -- not a rules change -- lowering the bar to end a filibuster on Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes to 51 to confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch) the Senate would vote to end debate on the nomination. That entails a simple majority. Once cloture on the nomination is “invoked” (halting a filibuster) debate is then limited to 30 hours. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Once 30 hours have expired the Senate may take an up-or-down vote on the nomination itself. It only needs 51 votes to confirm Barrett. That’s why we believe the actual confirmation of Barrett won’t happen until the middle or end of the week of Oct. 25 likely Oct. 28-30. , https://www.foxnews.com/politics/amy-coney-barrett-likely-confirmation-schedule-supreme-court,0.8102797014801117

Jeff Flake and Bob Corker who retired in 2019.  ""Both Senators became totally unelectable couldn’t come even close to winning their primaries and decided to drop out of politics and gracefully “RETIRE"" Trump tweeted. ""[Sasse] could be next or perhaps the Republicans should find a new and more viable candidate?"" The Twitter tirade against Sasse comes shortly after the senator's damning comments about Trump were reported. Sasse who never quite boarded the Trump train didn't hold back on a call with Nebraskans recently when a constituent asked him why he criticizes Trump so much. BEN SASSE RIPS COURT PACKING AS 'PARTISAN SUICIDE BOMBING' DURING BARRETT HEARING Sasse unleashed a nearly nine-minute diatribe first published by the Washington Examiner saying the commander-in-chief ""kisses dictators' butts"" ""sells out our allies"" mistreats women and ""spends like a drunken sailor."" Sasse said it's looking ""likely"" Trump will lose in November and Trump could take down the Senate with him in a ""blue tsunami."" “What the heck were any of us thinking that selling a TV-obsessed narcissistic individual to the American people was a good idea? It is not a good idea"" Sasse said. ""I think we are staring down the barrel of a blue tsunami and we’ve got to hold the Senate and that’s what I’m focused on.” Trump on Saturday rejected Sasse's assessment of the race with a four-word tweet: ""GIANT RED WAVE COMING!"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sasse's spokesman James Wegmann said his boss won't be dragged into a Twitter war with President Trump. ""Ben said the same thing to Nebraskans that he has repeatedly said to the President directly in the Oval Office"" Wegmann tweeted.

Graham replied: ""I know we have very different views about the judge and whether we should be doing this or not.

He was 85. Bush's manager confirmed his death to Rolling Stone and his date of death was listed as Oct. 16 on his website.

In 2001 the National Council of Communicative Disorders and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Associated honored Bush with their Annie Glenn Award. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2003 with Kris Kristofferson and Lefty Frizzell. Two years later Broadcast Music Inc. also awarded him with the Million-Air Award for ""Whiskey River"" reaching 1 million spins.

291,Tennessee cops arrest man after girl 3 kills father playing with a gun," Though Kenley Jansen never lost confidence in himself the big right-hander might be regaining that from the Los Angeles Dodgers after an inconsistent stretch. While not in a save situation Jansen closed out Game 5 with a dominating 12-pitch performance in which he struck out the side in a 7-3 win over the Atlanta Braves with the Dodgers facing potential elimination. That came two days after another 1-2-3 inning in a midgame appearance for LA in a 15-3 win. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM “I feel like if it clicked out there and you know once it clicked everything is going to come with it” Jansen said Saturday before the Dodgers faced another potential elimination game against the Braves. In the ninth inning Friday night Jansen threw 10 strikes and got three swinging strikeouts. His cutter was consistently in the 92-93 mph range and Johan Camargo swung and missed on a game-ending 94 mph sinker. “It was as good as I've seen in quite some time"" manager Dave Roberts said Saturday. “I thought the tempo I thought the delivery was cleaned up it was a little bit more smooth. The execution was considerably better. Mixed in some breaking balls some two-seamers some cutters so it was really good.” Jansen said he has had some recent conversations with former pitching coach Rick Honeycutt and former Dodgers standout Charlie Hough. The 33-year-old 3-time All-Star whose velocity had been noticeably down and his control inconsistent said they went over how his delivery wasn't the same as it had been when he was dominating hitters. “They showed me pictures of the past and how everything was working together. And you know it wasn’t quite the same"" Jansen said. “And kind of get back to that to make my delivery simple like it was and repeat it and it shows it showed yesterday.” The Dodgers’ primary closer since 2012 and their career leader with 312 saves Jansen had been bypassed with Game 1 of the NLCS tied at 1 in the ninth inning.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM After getting six interceptions and allowing only a safety against Mississippi State last week Kentucky (2-2) picked off three passes against the Vols (2-2). Tennessee has now followed up an eight-game winning streak with a two-game losing streak. Joseph's 41-yard touchdown and Davis' 85-yard return — both off interceptions thrown by Jarrett Guarantano — helped put Kentucky up 17-0 in the second quarter. With about 5 minutes left in the third quarter and trailing by 20 Tennessee went three-and-out for a second consecutive possession and was showered with boos from the sparse crowd of 22519. Earlier in the season Kentucky had shown signs of having difficulty recovering from adversity. Against Ole Miss a missed field goal was followed by 21 straight Ole Miss points and a 42-41 loss. Kentucky seemed to solve that Saturday. After falling behind 17-0 in the second quarter Tennessee was able to grind out a 75-yard drive to cut the deficit to 10 at the half.

The second-longest streak of passes without an interception in ACC history ended late in the first quarter when Zamari Walton picked off a pass by Lawrence. Under pressure from Georgia Tech’s pass rush Lawrence overthrew Powell. Walton ended Lawrence’s streak of 367 passes without an interception. It was Lawrence’s first interception since Oct. 19 2019 at Louisville. North Carolina State’s Russell Wilson set the ACC record with 379 consecutive passes without an interception from 2018-19. Otherwise it was one of the best games of Lawrence's career. His previous high was four touchdown passes. He passed that mark in the first half connecting for two scoring passes with Amari Rodgers. Georgia Tech (2-3 2-2) provided its fans an early thrill when freshman quarterback Jeff Sims threw a 59-yard scoring pass to Jalen Camp in the first quarter for a 7-7 tie. The Yellow Jackets' upset hopes faded quickly. Lawrence answered with an 83-yard scoring pass to Rodgers on the Tigers' next play and the Yellow Jackets never recovered.

Sims lost a fumbled shotgun snap to open Georgia Tech's next possession his first of two lost fumbles. Sims also threw an interception. The Tigers took advantage of a Georgia Tech defense which was focused on stopping Travis Etienne and the Clemson running game. Etienne had a 2-yard scoring run in the second quarter to become Clemson's all-time scoring leader but most of the scoring was provided by Lawrence's passes. Lawrence had a 34-yard scoring pass to tight end Davis Allen and also threw TD passes to Cornell Powell and Frank Ladson. Nyles Pickney a 300-pound defensive tackle had a 1-yard scoring run in a power package. Cez Mellusi added a 5-yard scoring run in the third quarter after Taisun Phommachanh replaced Lawrence. Georgia Tech's defense had no better luck against Clemson's backups. Freshman Hunter Helms threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to Ajou Ajou and had another scoring drive capped by Kobe Pace's 7-yard scoring run. Etienne had 11 carries for 44 yards and a touchdown and two catches for 29 yards. THE TAKEAWAY Clemson: The Tigers showed impressive poise in avoiding a letdown following last week's much-anticipated win over Miami. Clemson made an impressive case for its No. 1 ranking with the dominant win. Lawrence played like he was compiling a highlight film for his Heisman Trophy campaign. Georgia Tech: In a game viewed as a measuring stick for the second year of coach Geoff Collins' program the results were discouraging. Clemson beat the Yellow Jackets 52-14 to open last season in Collins' debut and this loss was more lopsided. After protecting the ball in last week's win over Louisville the Yellow Jackets had three turnovers. Sims completed 6 of 13 passes for 81 yards with one touchdown and one interception.

295,Lawrence throws 5 TDs No. 1 Clemson rolls past Georgia Tech," President Trump however has paid unprecedented attention to African Americans even in the crucial final weeks of the 2020 election cycle.   We can trace this focus back to 2016 when then-candidate Trump challenged Black voters to consider all their options. TRUMP'S WORK FOR BLACK COMMUNITY 'UNPARALLELED TO ANY OTHER PRESIDENT' OF PAST 50 YEARS: DEM LAWMAKER “Look at how much African-American communities have suffered under Democratic control” Trump said four years ago. “To those hurting I say: What do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump?”  Trump dared to go where few Republicans ever venture. “You're living in poverty” Trump said to Black voters. “Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?""  Some African Americans were insulted by Trump’s rhetoric; others agreed with him. I thought he could have made his point in a better way but there was certainly truth in his words. Historically African Americans have been stuck at or near the bottom rung on the economic ladder.   Kim Klacik a Black conservative Republican is running for the U.S. House in Maryland’s 7th Congressional District which includes some of the poorest most crime-ridden and hardest-hit parts of Baltimore. She released a video in August that went vital receiving more views on social media than former first lady Michelle Obama’s speech at the Democratic National Convention. In the video Klacik argued that Democratic policies have devastated Baltimore and said that Black people don’t need to vote for Democrats. She later received President Trump's endorsement in a district that most Republicans had written off as unwinnable for decades.  Klacik and I spoke in a recent episode of my new podcast “Outloud with Gianno Caldwell.” What she told me about President Trump’s efforts at outreach to Black voters was surprising — even for me although I’ve worked in politics for almost 20 years.  Our leaders need to pay special attention to the Black community especially in the inner cities. This is something the Trump campaign has done by creating community centers in mostly Black areas across the country.  Still President Trump’s critics have repeatedly called him a racist. Infamously Rep. Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y. described Trump as ""the grand wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.” invoking the Ku Klux Klan title while speaking at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day event.  I’ve been a Black conservative for well over a decade and almost every Republican I have ever known has been considered “a racist” by many members of the African American community. Growing up in inner-city Chicago I used to believe the same lies. But never have we seen the current level of vitriolic rhetoric come from such prominent people.  To be clear President Trump has said things that could potentially embolden bigots. At the first presidential debate for example he failed to denounce White supremacy clearly (although he has done so in the past) but Thursday he denounced it at an NBC town hall. TRUMP DENOUNCES WHITE SUPREMACY SAYS HE WILL ACCEPT A 'PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER' BUT WANTS 'TO WIN'  Despite such missteps the policies that Trump has put forth have unquestionably helped African Americans. He recently signed an executive order on police reform and earlier signed the First Step Act into law. The measure reforms the criminal justice system and has resulted in the release of thousands of people from prison (90 percent of whom are Black). The president has also promoted Opportunity Zones which incentivize private investment into marginalized communities. In addition Trump has increased federal funding for historically Black colleges and universities by 17 percent to a total exceeding $100 million — more than any president in history. President Barack Obama meanwhile infamously removed funds from a program created by the George W. Bush that annually funded $85 million directly to these prized institutions.  Trump also recently unveiled his Platinum Plan which pledges to create 3 million new jobs in the Black community open 500000 new Black-owned businesses and increase Black Americans’ access to capital by almost $500 billion over the next four years. Plus want to designate the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist group — something that President Obama never did.   As I mention in my book “Taken for Granted: How Conservatism Can Win Back the Americans That Liberalism Failed” Trump did something few Republicans dared to do during the 2016 campaign. He targeted the Black vote and spoke directly to African American issues.  On the other hand Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has a history riddled with policies that have harmed African Americans. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER For example the 1994 crime law which Biden helped author when he was a senator incentivized local police departments to conduct more aggressive patrolling creating mass incarceration of African Americans. Biden was also directly responsible for a provision of a 1986 law involving crack cocaine which came to be viewed as one of the most racially discriminatory sentencing policies on record. The law treated crack cocaine as significantly worse than powder cocaine. It ended up disproportionately punishing African Americans and sending them to prison while allowing more lenient treatment for White Americans who more often used cocaine it is powdered form.  During the presidential primaries some prominent African Americans — including radio show host Charlamagne tha God — complained that Biden doesn’t have a plan for Black Americans. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But that doesn’t matter to Biden who thinks Black voters should vote for him simply because he’s a Democrat regardless of whether his policies benefit them. Or as he said in May: “If you’ve got a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or for Trump then you ain’t Black.”   To the contrary Mr. Biden. I won’t be voting for you but I certainly am Black.   CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM GIANNO CALDWELL ", https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-black-voters-gianno-caldwell,0.8103242386415006
296,Gianno Caldwell: Trump has done a lot for Blacks — don’t say I ‘ain’t Black’ because I won’t vote for Biden, Leddie Brown broke open a close game with a long touchdown run in the third quarter and caught one of Jarret Doege’s three touchdown passes to lead West Virginia to a 38-17 victory Saturday over a winless Kansas team that was without coach Les Miles. Before a crowd of 10759 in the first game that West Virginia allowed the general public to attend amid the pandemic the Mountaineers (3-1 2-1 Big 12) overcame a bevy of mistakes to beat the Jayhawks for the seventh straight time. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM With West Virginia clinging to a 17-10 lead late in the third quarter Brown rumbled 87 yards up the middle untouched the start of three straight touchdowns for the Mountaineers. The 210-pound junior compiled 195 yards on 18 carries sitting out the fourth quarter. Brown also had a 6-yard scoring reception in the second quarter from Doege who also had TD passes of 33 yards to Bryce Ford-Wheaton and 8 yards to Sam James. Doege completed 26 of 44 passes for 318 yards. Miles tested positive for the coronavirus a week ago and was cleared to return to the Jayhawks on Thursday. But he chose not to travel with the team out of caution. Tight ends coach Joshua Eargle filled in for Miles against the Mountaineers. Despite some bright moments early the result was the same: The Jayhawks (0-4 0-3) have now lost 51 straight true road games in the conference. Kansas jumped out to a 10-0 lead including Andrew Parchment’s 43-yard scoring catch from Miles Kendrick off a deflected pass but the Jayhawks managed little offense the rest of the game. Pooka Williams scored on a 92-yard kickoff return in the fourth quarter for the Jayhawks. THE TAKEAWAY Kansas: The Jayhawks were limited to 157 yards of offense including 95 through the air against the Big 12's top defense. Kansas entered the game last among the 76 FBS teams that have played with 8.2 passing yards per completion. West Virginia: The Mountaineers had been looking to get more explosive plays downfield either with long runs or passes and they got both. Brown had eight runs of at least 10 yards including his long TD. Doege averaged 12 yards per completion. UP NEXT Kansas: Travels to No. 22 Kansas State next Saturday. West Virginia: Plays at Texas Tech next Saturday. , https://www.foxnews.com/sports/leddie-brown-doege-lead-west-virginia-over-kansas-38-17,0.8103199807583261
297,Leddie Brown Doege lead West Virginia over Kansas 38-17," Border Patrol agents in Texas recently apprehended smugglers who had separated a child from his parents -- something authorities warned could have left the youngster “helplessly under the control of strangers.” According to Border Patrol officials a van was stopped at the I-35 checkpoint north of Laredo on Oct. 8 where 16 illegal immigrants from Mexico El Salvador Honduras Guatemala and Ecuador were apprehended. Two of the illegal immigrants a married Honduran couple said they had been separated from their nine-year-old son by the smugglers. BORDER PATROL AGENT'S HUNCH PAYS OFF IN SECOND-LARGEST METHAMPHETAMINE BUST EVER  The pair told agents the child did not fit in the van so the smugglers said he would ""follow up"" with them -- but they did not know what that meant or when they would see their son again. That triggered a “Be On the Lookout” alert by agents and two hours later they stopped a minivan with four occupants at the same checkpoint. Among those in the vehicle was a nine-year-old child matching the description given by the parents The driver claimed the boy was hers but that was refuted by documentary proof by the actual parents. The boy was reunited with his family and the driver a U.S. citizen arrested and turned over the Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations unit. BORDER PATROL NABS TWO SEX OFFENDERS TRYING TO RE-ENTER US ILLEGALLY  Laredo Sector’s Chief Patrol Agent Matthew Hudak said in a statement that the case was an example of “the lack of concern human smugglers have for the people they exploit for profit.” “Smugglers not only transport large groups in confined spaces without PPE exposing them and our communities to possible COVID-19 infection but they are also willing to separate a young child from his parents” he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Officials warned that had they not found the boy he could have been trafficked or delivered to a location where the parents no longer were as they had been apprehended and removed from the U.S. “If not for the vigilance of the agents who only had a physical description to go on this child would have been taken by smugglers further into our country without his family and left helplessly under the control of strangers” Hudak warned. “Putting your life and the life of your family in the hands of vicious and callous criminal organizations is a potentially fatal mistake.” ", https://www.foxnews.com/us/border-patrol-agents-smuggling-child-parents,0.8103864559404894
298,Border Patrol agents stop smuggling case where child was separated from parents," This is a rush transcript from “The Story with Martha MacCallum"" October 12 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.    MACCALLUM: Ready to roll. Bret thank you very much. So President Trump not really wasting any time. He is at the podium already at a rally in Sanford Florida tonight. We just want to bring in for quick thoughts here Karl Rove former Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush and Fox News Contributor and Juan Williams Fox News Political Analyst co-host of The Five. Gentlemen while he is thanking everybody and getting rolling here. Karl he is said to want to do a campaign rally or a big event almost every day this week just off of COVID-19. Your quick thoughts?    KARL ROVE FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well he's back on the road and we'll see if this is a template for what we can expect in the next 21 days. How focused is he? Does he give a message that shows the contrast between he and Joe Biden? What's his narrative about who Biden is and what he's all about? Tonight will be a tip off if you will about what we're likely to see in the days ahead.    MACCALLUM: Quick thought Juan.    JUAN WILLIAMS FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well it's his first event Martha back on the road after being diagnosed with COVID. His doctor says he's well but you got to wonder no mask few masks no mask on him few masks in the audience. And I think lots of people still concerned about how he's handled the virus.    MACCALLUM: He tossed a few masks out to the crowd on his way in. Let's listen in for a moment and we'll come back.    DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Look we can't play games. The one thing I know for sure President Xi of China did us no favor. President Putin of Russia you look at around Kim Jong-un whatever happened to the war where he was supposed to be in with Kim Jong-un Kim Jong-un there are 100 percent sharp we have somebody running who is not 100 percent. He's not 80 percent. He's not 60 percent. We can't have this as a country. We can't have it.    Joe Biden is also owned by the radical globalists the wealthy donors the big money special interests who shipped away your job shut down your factories threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in this ridiculous endless wars set of endless wars that we've been in for a long time 19 years. They're all coming back home. You know that right. They're all coming back home our great warriors our great soldiers.    The corrupt political class is desperate to regain their power by any means necessary. We're the ones standing in their way. We're the ones standing up for the American worker the American family and for the American dream. And that's what we're doing on this beautiful evening this beautiful evening in Florida. Do I like Florida? Did we win Florida last time? Was that beautiful? We won it.    You know everything I hear we're winning by a lot. Then you turn on the fake news. They say the polls are tied in Florida I don't get it. We had the same thing last year. Remember four years ago we had the same thing.    We're going to lose Florida they said four years ago by five points. They call that thing so early in the evening we won by a lot and we're winning by a lot more now than we were four years ago. 22 days from now we're going to win this state. We're going to win four more years in the White House. We're going to make our country greater than it has ever been before.    Thank you ma'am. Thank you. This is the most important election in the history of our country and I used to say it in 2016 I'm sorry at the time I thought it was. These people are crazy. We have to win. Most important we've ever had.    Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party's nomination. He's handed control to the socialists the Marxists and the Left-wing extremists and you know that. And he's got no strength left. He's got no power left. He's got nothing going. If he wins the radical left will be running the country and they're addicted to power. And God help us if they ever got it because we would never have the same country again. And you couldn't make a comeback. You don't make comebacks from where they'd take us.    If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician it's because frankly I'm not a politician. I'm embarrassed by the board. And if I don't always play by the rules of Washington establishment is because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody has ever fought for you.    And I had a very nice life before this I will tell you. A lot easier but I love this and I would have never ever changed because we are doing more for this country than any administration has ever done despite the witch hunts and the phony stuff that we caught them on now we caught them cold and we'll see what happens with that. Just watch. Stay tuned.    Right now I'm fighting to make sure we eradicate the virus rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. We're hitting record stock market numbers record 401(k)s record stocks record job numbers. Don't blow it don't blow it.    Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your taxes you know wants to quadruple. How about where he gets caught again. He said oh no we're not going to give a tax increase but we're going to terminate all of the Trump tax cuts. Well that's $2000 plus child tax credits plus all of the other things you're talking about $6000 $7000 $8000 a year. I don't think Florida is going to be paying that per family.    And if you add energy into that we have energy at an all-time low. We're energy independent. Nobody ever thought that was going to happen. And when you're paying less than $2 at the pump like you are nobody ever thought you'd see those days again. Those days are here for a long time if we're smart.    We've been beating China; we've been beating everybody. Until the plague came in we were teaching China like they've never been taught before and they know it and they've told me that and they never thought it could happen. And we're very soon going to be doing it again. We achieved all of this despite the fact that we caught them cold. They were spying on our campaign - it's our campaign not my campaign.    They were spying on our campaign and illegally trying to take down a very very straightforward and legally sworn in administration we were sworn in they tried before the fact they tried after the fact we were an administration - and then they say we want to know if you will agree with a friendly transfer of power. For four years they've been trying to get us out of office. Four years they've been trying to get us out but we'll take care of it all after the election. We caught him cold. We caught him cold bad people crooked Hillary.    And by the way Obama and Biden knew everything that was happening. OK just in case you had any questions. We'll take care of it after the election. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialist but that gives you another reason to go out and vote. We got to get in. As we know they'll just sweep it under the rug.    Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs dismantle your police departments dissolve your borders. You know that. Release criminal aliens confiscate your guns. No more Second Amendment get used to it. Destroy your suburbs and drive God from the public square. That's what's going to happen.    You saw in the Pledge of Allegiance during the Democratic National Convention; they took the word God out twice. They said oh we made a mistake excuse me. Then it happened the second time. We said well I guess that wasn't a mistake right?    Biden even refuses to answer questions on the packing of the Supreme Court. Nobody even thought of that for many many many decades. And that's what they want to do. They can't get there legitimately. So they say that's all right. We'll just pack the court. We'll put a lot of super lefties on the court and we'll have a whole different country. No not going to happen that way. We're not going to let it happen. You've got to get out and vote.    A lot of people said that I was elected because of the Supreme Court because I said I'm going to put great conservative constitutionalist great judges on the Supreme Court. I don't know if it's true but if it is true it's more true now than it was four years ago and you've got to get out and vote because they're going to destroy our country and they're going to destroy our U.S. Supreme Court. And we can't let that happen.    But who would have thought we're on number three? Other presidents have never had any. They've never had any. We're at three already three and a half years. And I will say this I will say this it's driving them crazy. It's driving them crazy. And Amy is fantastic. A great intellect a great scholar. I think she's going to be a fantastic U.S. Supreme Court justice.    As America saw earlier today in Amy's opening statement in the Senate Judge Barrett a brilliant scholar who will defend our laws our rights our freedom and our Constitution like very few people would have the capability of doing. The radical left is hell bent on destroying everything we love and cherish. They're enraged and unhinged out of vengeance and nobody can believe what they're doing and where they're going. But we understand it. We understand their cancel culture. We're not letting them cancel culture us at all. We're proud of our country and we're proud of our heritage.    They want to punish the middle class expunge every last trace of traditional values and replace the American dream with a socialist nightmare and that's what it is. They want to turn America into communist Cuba a socialist Venezuela and ruin the lives of Hispanic Americans and all Americans.    And I want to thank the Hispanic Americans down in Florida you have been so incredible to Trump. Biden's agenda would be a catastrophe for Florida seniors and by the way you know Biden was a big lover of Castro. You do know that right? And you know the deal that I broke. You saw that right as I came into office Obama gave the whole planet away to Castro. And I said no thank you. We're not doing that. That's why we just got the Bay of Pigs award from the Cuban Americans. Thank you very much. And a lot of them are here. Thank you all very much. Bay of Pigs.    For years Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. You know all about that. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal health care for illegal aliens. Now we all have heart and we all want to take care of people. But what you're doing is you're telling millions of people to pour up into our country. We're going to give you education. We're going to give you health care. We're going to give you everything. We can't do it. We can't afford it. We can't take care of our own people. We have to take care of our people first. And if they let that happen you would be decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security.    Well I'm president no one will touch your Medicare no one will touch or hurt in any way shape or form your Social Security. With your vote I will finish building the strongest economy the world has ever seen. And we were there. Last year was the greatest year in the history of the state of Florida.    And I have to say it was practically that way for almost every state in the Union but it was Florida's best year. The year coming is going to be and you're going to see a great third quarter set of numbers coming out very soon just before the election. So I'm putting myself in the spot. The third quarter numbers are going to be record setting phenomenal numbers. Next year is going to be the best year we've ever had economically.    But as I've done from the beginning I will keep every promise and I will always put America first. You haven't heard that right? You haven't heard that from other people.    Under my leadership we're delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery like nobody can even believe. And if you look at our upward path no country in the world has recovered the way we've recovered economically or otherwise not even close. And if you vote for me prosperity will search normal life. That's all we want. We want a normal life. We'll fully resume. And the Florida tourism and hospitality industries that I know so well will reach historic new highs highs like they've never reached before.    Biden would terminate our recovery delay the vaccine prolong the pandemic and annihilate Florida's economy with the draconian unscientific lockdown. That's what he wants to do. Lock it down lock it down everybody.    And you know what? If you don't feel good about going out stay relax stay. You know the risk groups; you know the older people. See fortunately I'm not an old person. I'm very young and I'm in such perfect shape. Right? I'm in such great shape. I said that the other day what are you doing? I said well I'm very young and I'm in great shape perfect shape. And they said Donald Trump misrepresented today again. He said he was in great shape but he's very young. These people are the sickest of them all.  But the World Health Organization did you see what happened they just came out a little while ago and they admitted that Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat run states where they're locked down sealed up suicide rates drug rates alcoholism deaths by so many different forms. You can't do that.    And I want to just congratulate the governor and everybody in Florida you are open and open for business and doing good. And we got to remember I said it right at the beginning the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Can't be. The cure cannot be worse. But if you don't feel good about it if you want to stay stay relax stay. But if you want to get out there get out.    One thing with me the nice part I went through it. Now they say I'm immune. I feel so powerful. I'll walk into that audience. I'll walk in there and I'll kiss everyone in that audience. I'll kiss the guys and the beautiful women and everybody I'll just give you a big fat kiss. No but there is something nice. I don't have to be locked up in my basement and I wouldn't allow that to happen anyway. I wouldn't allow it to happen. When you're the president you can't lock yourself in a basement and say I'm not going to bother with the world. You've got to get out and it's risky. It's risky but you've got to get out.    But it does give you a good feeling when you can beat something. And now they say you're immune. I don't know for how long. Some people say for life. Some people say for four months. I mean every time I think about it every time I hear that we get shorter and shorter and shorter because they want it to be as bad as possible. But it is a great feeling.    I want to thank by the way Walter Reed Medical Hospital Johns Hopkins. These guys are incredible.    We're 90 percent better now than we were six seven months ago in terms of a cure for people that get really sick. 90 percent. It's incredible what's happened. And with children it's 99.9 percent. You're going to be OK. You're going to be OK. 99.9 they have a little better immune system. We just learned that better than you have right? Better than we all have.    But we love our children but we have to get our schools open we have to get our businesses going back we have to get our country rolling and it is rolling. You're going to see that when the numbers come out.    The Biden virus plan and you've got to remember he took H1N1 which he always calls N1H1 he gets it mixed I said no Joe H comes first. But it's called the swine flu right? And his own person his chief of staff said that he it was a disaster the way they ran it a much less lethal problem but a disaster the way they ran it a total catastrophe it was so bad. It was so bad. And then he says I'm going to tell him what to do.    But when I locked down China he thought it was a terrible thing. He called me xenophobic right when I locked down China which was in January much earlier than what he said then ultimately admitted I'm right. But then he said oh he should have acted faster. Well this was months later. Then he says I should have acted. Nobody acted fast like I did. I also shut down locked down Europe if you remember.    And the bottom-line is we saved millions of lives. When this first came out. If we didn't do a good job they predicted 2.2 million people would die. We're 210000. We shouldn't be at one. It's China's fault. They allowed this to happen. They allowed to escape. They allowed it to escape China. But 2.2 million people would have died. Just remember that. Just remember that in fact they don't like talking about. I have such respect for the people of this country the way they've handled it. It's been an incredible it's been an incredible love fest together. That's really what has been.    And sympathies from all of us to those people whose family members have died whose friends - I've lost friends I've lost friends. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.    You're going to love me even more. You're going to love me even more because we're years ahead on vaccines and they're going to be distributed very shortly. I mean frankly it's a big political deal going on where they don't want it to be before the election. Don't let it be. But we have great vaccines coming. Johnson &amp; Johnson Moderna Pfizer. I mean we have great great things happening with the vaccines. I think even greater with the cures and with the therapeutics. And maybe it's why I'm here with you. Maybe it's not - I'm not sure I know one thing. I was very happy to take it that I can tell you.    But through Operation Warp Speed we're on track to have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year and they'll be delivered by the military and they're all set to go. They're waiting for final approval. And that vaccine will end the pandemic. But we're also launching a historic effort to bring your medical supply chains back.    In 1996 Joe Biden voted to obliterate Puerto Rico's thriving pharmaceutical industry. Remember they used to have a great pharmaceutical industry. He cut it out and when he cut it out he sent Puerto Rico into a nosedive like nobody has ever seen before. So we're bringing it all back and we're bringing it back to Florida to we're bringing it all the way back taking our jobs away from China.    We're bringing them back from China. I'll reverse Biden's catastrophic decision. We'll bring it all back. The drug industry is coming back into Puerto Rico coming back into by the way Pennsylvania coming back into North Carolina South Carolina Georgia coming back into Michigan coming back into Ohio. We're bringing it all back.    Last month I also announced an additional $13 billion in disaster relief for Puerto Rico and for Florida. Have I taken care of Florida? Have I taken care of Florida?    My administrations allocated over $60 billion and if you look at Florida your great governors your last two governors have been great your two senators great they're always calling asking for money. But I guess that's what they're supposed to be doing. And I'm always giving it when it comes to Florida. The Panhandle got hit really hard over the last two years. We took care of the Panhandle. So days ago I was honored to receive the endorsement of the governor of Puerto Rico. Can you believe that? Right.    Wanda Vazquez Garced and she was so nice. We're also joined by several great Puerto Rican community leaders Jay Rosario Gabe Ruiz Daisy Morales Mayra Guzman-Kaslow and candidate for Congress Dr. Leo Valentin. Please where are you?    I'm not going to say the best but I'm just about the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico. You better vote for me Puerto Rico. You better vote for me. But I'll always be fighting for Puerto Rico it's very unfair the way they were treated by Democrats. And while Biden will surrender your jobs to China your country and your fellow politicians and I have a lot of great ones right here including your governor.    But we're never going to - we will never allow ourselves to even think about surrendering to the Left-wing mob they're on the run.    They're on the run. Better not have them have a little bit of a victory because if they have even a little victory it's not going to be good. I'm bringing our jobs back home and putting violent criminals behind bars. I'm working with your political leaders. We've also directed the FBI to immediately investigate the destruction of the Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln statues in Portland and to prosecute the offenders to the fullest extent of federal law.    Biden supporters are causing mayhem in the streets. If he wins there will be nothing but bedlam all over the place. But he's not going to win. If he won he may be the worst presidential candidate in history and I got him. I got him.    It actually puts more pressure on. If you ran against a great candidate there's actually less pressure. You want to know the truth. Thank you. Thank you.    We want to keep our country great. We're bringing it to a level that it's never been our military has equipment the likes of which nobody has ever seen. No country has ever seen or made in the USA. Rockets missiles tanks ships the likes of which jet fighters bombers tankers the likes of which no country has ever seen before our nuclear arsenal is the strongest by far in the world the strongest it's ever been. And I hope to God we never have to even think about using it. And the way you won't have to use it is to have it.    At our debate Biden could not name a single law enforcement organization that supports him not one. And that's because - and by the way did Vice President Mike Pence do a great job? He did. He did a great job.    But it's because Biden and Harris that's another great one. There was nobody so mean to Biden than her nobody and so brilliantly I said he can't pick her because nobody treated him as badly although I will say this had Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren got out prior to Super Tuesday we would have had Bernie instead. But I'd rather have Biden because he's now alienated the Left he's alienated the Right. Nobody knows what the hell he stands for.    How about Pennsylvania? He goes to Pennsylvania for a year and a half he's against fracking. The day he gets the nomination through a little luck because she didn't get out so she took all of Bernie's votes right. But gets - the following day he said I'm in favor of fracking but he's not. And it doesn't matter because the radical left will never let Pennsylvania and Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and Ohio never let them frack. That's over with.    But can you imagine and the press you know which is fake and corrupt the press never said have you ever heard him ask once well wait a minute. For one year you said there will be no fracking. And he said it strongly right. Read my lips right. To use an old expression read my lips. There would be no fracking that didn't work out too well.    So now he goes and he says there will be fracking. Not once have I asked - have I heard the question. Not once have I asked why Hunter was able to take $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Not once have I heard these frauds back there. Not once have I heard the fake news. Not once have I heard him say $1 billion. If you don't change that prosecutor you're not getting the billion dollars. And then he goes the prosecutor was changed a prosecutor against his son.    Not once have I heard them talking about that question. Can you imagine if we did that? And on top of everything else the Democrat Party declared war on our great police and law enforcement. That's what it is.    So I proudly received the endorsements of the Fraternal Order of Police the National Association of Police Organization the National Troopers Coalition the International Union the Police Association the National Latino Police Officers Association. The Florida police chiefs and all of these incredible organizations plus all over the country and when I asked them name one organization give me one organization during our debate where he was saved by the moderator about four times he couldn't answer it. Name one law enforcement organization. He couldn't name one. Then I said say the words law enforcement. Just say it couldn't do it.    He couldn't say it. We're joined tonight by a great group of people warriors really warriors who came to me a couple of years ago. He said I want to run for governor. I said Ron I don't know. Do they know you well enough? But he was a great defender and a brilliant guy. Harvard Yale top of his class smart as hell. Nobody knows how smart. Don't tell too many people he likes to catch you by surprise. But he's a great great guy and he's been a great friend. I said all right I'll endorse you. I endorsed him and the rest he went like a rocket ship and he handled the pressure and his wife Casey is better than him. I've been saying it for a long time Governor Ron DeSantis.    Great guy great great couple great great couple. Smart brilliant sit down please. Really just a great - they're a great group of people. Those people are great. And he surrounds himself with incredible people with the exception of course of Representative Matt Gaetz.    (CROWD CHEERING)    TRUMP: Matt Gaetz. You talk about a warrior right? Ron what do you think huh? Matt Gaetz is a great man a great gentleman and what a future he has. I don't know about swap it but I think I might. Great. Thank you Matt. Thank you. Thank you both for being here. I appreciate it.    John Rutherford where is John? John? Thank you John. Mike Waltz. Mike thank you.    (CROWD CHEERING)    TRUMP: Thank you. Nice couple. Gus Bilirakis.    (APPLAUSE)    TRUMP: Gus. Congressional candidate. To somebody who is supposed to be potentially a superstar. We've heard that a lot. Sometimes it works out it's going to in his case. Scott Franklin.    (APPLAUSE)    TRUMP: Scott thank you. He's got the look he could be. That's good. That's good. I hear good things Scott. Going well? How's he doing? Ron he's doing good? Ron says you are doing good. Good. You've got to win. Thank you Scott very much.    Kimberly where is Kimberly? Kimberly.    (APPLAUSE)    TRUMP: Thank you. I watched you coming and speaking I said that's a lot to follow. Kimberly is great. I want to thank Kimberly. And finally we're joined by a group of amazing supporters who recently walked away from the Democrats and will be voting for us. We have a lot of them.    (CROWD CHEERING)    TRUMP: A lot of them. And a lot of them in law enforcement. A lot of law enforcement. They were Democrats. In some cases they left their parties and in other cases they just said no we're voting for Trump. I said why are you doing that? We have no choice. I said you are right you are right. But nobody has been better to law enforcement than I have.    You know when I first came in we gave away hundreds of millions of dollars of military equipment that was in storage. It wasn't doing anybody any good. It was collecting dust probably paying rent all over the place. That's probably why they had it come to think of it. Well look how far that crowd goes back? Hey cameras would you please -- man look at that.    (CROWD CHEERING)    TRUMP: Man that's into those hangers.    (CROWD CHANTING)    TRUMP: Wow. You know these are the real polls. So when did you hear about this meeting like a day ago? These are the real polls right? The other guy gets out there and he's -- they worked and work and work and 30 people show up. They put them in those crazy circles right? They only have the circles because that's the only way they can fill up the room. It's true.    But that's a fantastic group of people thank you. Same thing over here. I wish the fake news would turn the cameras. You know for a long time I didn't think the cameras moved that way. But then any time there was a little sign of problems they can twist around like a pretzel. And I realized they could. But they don't like to show those crowds. But that is a massive amount. I don't know how people are here but you got a lot. I want to thank you.    (CROWD CHEERING)    TRUMP: So this evening we are also praying for all of the families on the Florida Panhandle affected by hurricane Sally. And I will tell you Ron Marco and everybody I will tell you. Rick. Everybody has been calling and calling and calling. Matt Gaetz has been driving us a little crazy. Matt you could take it a little easier.    But that's what somebody that's good is supposed to do. Right? They are supposed to call. But we take care of the Panhandle and we are doing it at a level that's never been done before. And I've done it. I think I can say right from the beginning right?    I tell the story about Ron DeSantis he came to see me. He just became governor. We had a hurricane. Sir thank you very much for the money you sent to the Panhandle in Florida. I appreciate it. Good Ron. Good. I hope it's enough good. Spend it well.    I get a call three days later sir can I see you? And I'm watching tonight. I said you will have to come up. He told no no no it's very important. Sir he comes into the Oval Office sir can we have an extra $500 million? I said Ron will it ever end Ron? And one thing I found out it never ends for the Panhandle and for Ron. But we take care of it right Ron?    (APPLAUSE)    TRUMP: We take care of it. Great great people. You have great people. They are warriors. I'll tell you they are warriors they are fighters. We need more people like that. I will tell you.    Last month I approved a major disaster declaration for the state of Florida. And I will be with you through every step of the rebuilding and you will be hit with others.    The one thing we know about Florida you are very good at this stuff you get hit by hurricanes and you rebuild. And you rebuild fast. And it's incredible. I have watched I have watched. And you know one much LPD you are proud people you are incredible people you put it back together. But we are there for you all the way.    And we're there monetarily and we're there with FEMA. And I think Ron FEMA has been incredible haven't they? Right? They have been incredible. Thank you to FEMA. We have a lot of FEMA people here right over there.    We spent the last four years reversing the damage Biden has inflicted over the last 47 years with that ridiculous dumb thought NAFTA TPP and China's entry into the World Trade Organization a disaster for our country.    (CROWD BOOING)    TRUMP: You know China is considered a developing nation. I stopped that. China is considered a developing -- in other words China is so wonderful they are developing isn't that nice. Now by being a developing nation they get much more benefits than a nation that's not a developing nation.    So I said well we are a developing nation too if they are a developing nation. And we just won you know this we just 17 and half billion dollars from the World Trade Organization.    (APPLAUSE)    TRUMP: And from the World Health Organization I took us out. They said why did you do that? I said number one they are wrong on everything although they corrected themselves today and they said I was right for the lockdowns. But I said number two why are we paying 500 million a year and China which has 1.4 billion people is paying 39 million a year? Explain that. They couldn't explain it. It was very hard to explain.    So I took us out for that and other reasons. OK? So we'll see what happens with that.    (APPLAUSE)    TRUMP: But these are the deals -- I could go over hundreds of different things with you and just common sense I mean common sense what we do. Think of it World Health Organization. We spent -- we have 325 million people. We spent $500 million. China spends $39 million and China dominates them. I said it doesn't work that way anymore. It doesn't work that way anymore.    (APPLAUSE)    TRUMP: They will take us back in so fast it will be much less money. For decades our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations. Fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs and our factories and our troops back home. To the USA.    (CROWD CHEERING)    MARTHA MACCALLUM FOX NEWS ANCHOR: President Trump in Sanford Florida tonight just north of Orlando. We want to bring in with some reaction this evening to how he is doing so far tonight back on the campaign trail for the first time since his COVID-19 diagnosis.    Governor Mike Huckabee former 2016 presidential candidate and Fox News contributor and Mike Meehan chief executive officer of Squared Communications and an old campaign hand as well.    Good to have both of you with us tonight. Thank you very much for being here. Let me go to you first Governor Huckabee. The president there is lot of discussion about how we came out on the balcony on Saturday. He was going to talk for 30 minutes only talked for 16.    So then that ramped up a whole another round of speculation that he was weak that he wasn't doing as well as he said he was doing. He seems to have a lot of energy tonight. I think that's pretty clear.    MIKE HUCKABEE FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes I think most people who have even had a little touch of a cold would like to have that kind of energy. The man is 74 years old and he's out there in the Florida heat and humidity. And he is like a tent evangelist.    I mean this is pretty amazing. I mean he just got of the hospital a few days ago from COVID. I think if there's any question as to whether he is fit to be president he is erasing that tonight. And he is coherent he is fluid he's having a good time he's in his element.    MACCALLUM: But Governor --    (CROSSTALK)    HUCKABEE: And I think one of the things that the press can't handle Martha he has a great sense of humor. He has fun doing what he does. They take everything seriously and that's why they never have gotten him. But the American people do.    MACCALLUM: So you think it was -- how seriously do you take the superman suit idea?    HUCKABEE: I doubt that's true. I mean the source was the New York Times. I mean that's got to be the most absolutely disgustingly unreliable source when it comes to anything about Donald Trump that there has ever been.    MACCALLUM: Well you know Mike Meehan there's obviously a lot of discussion about whether it was safe for the president to go back on the campaign trail. This is a candidate and a president who has 22 days left. He's got some numbers that obviously he's looking at and sees the need to turn around. What do you think?    MICHAEL MEEHAN CEO SQUARED COMMUNICATIONS: Look if you had a kid who went to school with someone who had COVID they wouldn't go back to school for 14 days. It's highly irresponsible for this man to be in front of a bunch of people with no masks. There's no way our kids could go to school if this was the case whether they had it or whether they were next to somebody who had it.    So this is insane what he is doing right now. He gets that run away that he wants he's got 22 days. But if this race is being decided by COVID he's losing seniors he's losing women because he can't keep the White House safe how can he keep your house safe?    MACCALLUM: Governor Huckabee do you want to respond to that?    HUCKABEE: I didn't realize that your other guest was a medical doctor. You know his own doctors who are the finest in the world from Johns Hopkins and Walter Reed said it was OK for him to do this. So I don't know why all these reporters somehow are better medical practitioners than the people who actually went to medical school and are giving him advice.    (CROSSTALK)    MEEHAN: Well I'm not a reporter. I'm not a reporter Governor. But the problem is is that if your kid or your grandkids were in school with somebody with COVID they couldn't go back to school for 14 days. That's what the medical doctors are saying.    (CROSSTALK)    MACCALLUM: Well there are people Mike who think that those rules are onerous as well. You know if the doctor clears you then you should probably be able to go back. I would also point out that the president is probably is 25 feet from anybody in that crowd.    But Governor Huckabee I think a lot of folks do look at the crowd. And you know some people do have masks on in that crowd but they just get worried about them all packed in there so close in that environment.    HUCKABEE: I don't even disagree with that. Look I'm a lot more careful than most of the people in that crowd. But that's what America is about it. Let's us make our own decisions. Quite frankly Martha when I go places I do wear a mask. I do sanitize and I social distance because I don't want to get the stuff.    MACCALLUM: Yes.    HUCKABEE: I may not get this you know greater care as some other people. So I'm very careful. But I'm also in the age group I've had double pneumonia but that's my responsibility to take care of myself. I don't expect everybody else to stop their lives because I'm trying to be careful.    MACCALLUM: All right.    HUCKABEE: And that's what I really do believe has got to be remembered in all of this.    MACCALLUM: Couple of things Mike before we run out of time. The president is addressing this WHO story today. That they think the lockdown was overdone that they are concerned that it has made globally it's made the poor more poor. It has doubled poverty levels doubled malnutrition levels. So they're really pointing the finger back and saying that this lockdown may have been -- may have been a mistake may have been overdone to a dangerous degree.    MEEHAN; Well it's abundantly clear if you make your living you know talking on TV or able to work from home you have bounce back from this recovery. But if you make your living in a service sector if you are a restaurant worker if you are a schoolteacher going to teach kids those people are having harder time bouncing back because of that. There's no question about that.    And you saw Joe Biden today in Ohio talking about how to get people back to work but to do it safely and to do it responsibility. And there's a big choice. He's playing offense in Ohio while Donald Trump is playing defense in Florida in a state that he carried last time.    So Joe Biden is opening up the map because he has a message of let's get the economy back to work by getting the virus under control by following common sense health standards.    MACCALLUM: You know I notice that the president was saying look if you don't want to go out you shouldn't go out. You can stay home. I mean there is obviously a lot of seniors that live in Florida and the president seems to be dragging in that category and it may be because of the handling of coronavirus Governor. Real quick before we go.    HUCKABEE: Yes. I don't think that's the issue. And I think he's got plenty of time to make it up. But I'd finally say that let's also remember that today Joe Biden announced that he was running for the U.S. Senate. So if we want to talk about good health let's open that can of worms --    (CROSSTALK)    MACCALLUM: Did he say that again today?    HUCKABEE: -- and let's talk about it.    MACCALLUM: He said it in the past.    HUCKABEE: Today.    MACCALLUM: OK.    HUCKABEE: Yes.    MACCALLUM: Michael Meehan thank you. Good to have you here tonight. Governor Huckabee good to have you here as well.    So you saw it here President Trump not taking it easy. He's back out there and we understand that he is going to go to North Carolina he's going to go to Iowa going to go to Pennsylvania all this week.    Dr. Richard Besser joins us with the facts on immunity which the president just spoke about. And I know everybody at home wonders. Are you immune if you've had it? Are you not immune if you've had it? We're going to talk about it after this.    TRUMP: -- and why hasn't he even arrested? We sent in the U.S. marshals. In 15 minutes it was all over. 15 minutes    (APPLAUSE)    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)    MACCALLUM: Well the president said he wanted to get back out on the road. He wanted to rally second rallies again. He is in the middle of the first one tonight and he has several more planned over the course of this week back-to-back.    And it's the first time he's really been out at one of these events since he tested positive for COVID-19. His physician put out a memo late Saturday assuring the public that he's quote ""no longer considered a transmission risk to others."" The president followed up with these moments ago. Watch this.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    TRUMP: One thing with me the nice part. I went through it and now they say I'm immune. I can feel -- I feel so powerful. But it does give you a good feeling when you can beat something and now they say you are immune. I don't know for how long. Some people say for life some people say for four months.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    MACCALLUM: All right so let's see what this person says. Dr. Richard Besser president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC. Dr. Besser thank you for being here tonight.    RICHARD BESSER PRESIDENT &amp; CEO ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION: Thanks Martha.    MACCALLUM: What was your reaction when you heard the president talked about being immune? He actually said he wanted to go out and kiss everyone in the audience too. But he did not do that I should point out.    BESSER: Well I'm glad he didn't do that. One of the things that's clear is that there is still a lot we don't know about this virus. And infections with this virus. It appears that once you've had this infection there is some degree of protection. But it's not clear how long that lasts and how complete.    You know there have been a few very well-documented cases who have had COVID once and have gotten again with a slightly different -- different variety of the virus. And so that's clear. But if there was no immunity we would have expected that that would be a much more common occurrence.    You know one of the things that's really important is if you don't get some degree of immunity from the natural infection it's highly unlikely that a vaccine which tries to mimic in a sense in an infection would work. And so you know the thinking is there is some degree of protection.    MACCALLUM: Yes. I think that's a great point. You know because the whole basis of a vaccine is that you could essentially give someone a little bit of their antibody fights it off and builds that kind of immunity.    There was a Harvard piece that came out I guess today or yesterday that talks about so far it looks like there's about four months of immunity in many of the patients that they have had part of that study. And you know is that just because that's about how long they've been able to look at it so far? And that it could be longer than that?    BESSER: Well there are different types of immunity.    MACCALLUM: Right.    BESSER: So you know if you had an infection you give a blood sample they can measure protective factors called antibodies. And for a number of infections over time those will go away. It doesn't necessarily mean that you have no protection because we have cells in our body a certain types of white blood cells that when they are exposed again will very quickly start to produce more antibodies.    And so scientists are going to be following and are following people over longer periods of time to see well once that antibodies go away what level of protection do you have? Is it totally on? Or do you still have protection and how much?    You know the other questions that have to be answered is if you had this infection once and you're exposed to the virus is it possible that you could still transmit it to somebody else but not get sick yourself?    So a lot of questions that still need to be answered. It's one of the reasons why the recommendations from CDC are if you've had the infection you should still follow the same precautions as other people from the social distancing and hand washing and wearing masks.    MACCALLUM: It's very interesting. You know with regard to what my last guest said you know why is it OK why does the doctor tell the president that he is not transmitting the virus anymore after 10 days or so. We don't know exactly because we don't know when his last negative test was.    And a child might be told that they have to stay home from school for 14 days before they can go back to the classroom. Why would that be?    BESSER: Well I mean there are couple of things. If someone has had mild to moderate COVID so they haven't been hospitalized they weathered this fairly well. The CDC recommendations are that after 10 days and at least 24 hours of no fever without medication you can go -- you can go back to your regular activities.    If you have had severe disease so you've required oxygen and other medication then the recommendation is that you be isolated for up to 20 days. And so there's a difference there between the two types of scenarios. And you know for each individual it will vary.    The president has had all kinds of different testing that isn't available to the general public. And so the question there in terms of their testing they did not find any virus that was alive even though it sounds like they found little bits of fragments.    MACCALLUM: Dr. Richard Besser always good to talk to you sir. Thank you very much.    BESSER: Likewise.    MACCALLUM: Democracy 2020 continues after this.    (APPLAUSE)    TRUMP: A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe --    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)    MACCALLUM: We've been watching the president in Florida he's going to try to make up for lost time very very packed schedule for him over the course of this week as he tries to make up some of the missed time last week.    His opponent Joe Biden also on the trail today focused on the economy in Ohio. A state that President Trump won by eight points in 2016 but it is a razor-thin margin of less than one in the average of polls right now.    Let's go to correspondent Jacqui Heinrich is covering the Biden camp tonight. Hi Jackie.    JACQUI HEINRICH FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening Martha. President Trump won Ohio in 2016 it is considered a crucial stage for his reelection. And until recently Biden hasn't focused a lot of attention there instead campaigning in nearby battlegrounds like Michigan and Pennsylvania which President Trump won by a narrower margin    But the polls had Biden with a razor-thin advantage in Ohio and he kept the focus on his economic plan. Speaking to auto industry union workers Biden slam President Trump for job losses and touted his own role rescuing a million auto industry jobs during the 2008 recession under President Obama.    Biden largely ignored the confirmation hearings underway on Capitol Hill making only a single mention at each stop and even then he steered the focus away from Judge Barrett herself saying this nomination is about President Trump's crusade to eliminate his predecessor's healthcare plan.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: With fewer jobs than he had when he came to office. Donald Trump's only plan is more tax cuts for the wealthy.    Most of you if you have hell of job pay more and he pay less --    (END VIDEO CLIP)    HEINRICH: Republicans want to cease on any democratic cynicism of Judge Barrett over her faith because it breaks the American standard of not judging folks based on religion. Democrats did criticized Barrett on her faith during her appellate court hearings and the Trump campaigns already made attack ads out of it. Today Joe Biden caution against a repeat saying Judge Barrett should not be judged on her faith.    Now since getting back on the campaign trail Biden has stayed largely on script but today he seemed back in the habit of telling long anecdotes that in the past have led to gaffes. The Trump campaign is seizing on a couple moments one where he appeared to forget Mitt Romney's name two others where he misspoke one saying he was running for senates. But he did correct himself both times Martha.    MACCALLUM: All right. Jacqui Heinrich thank you very much covering the Biden campaign throughout the course of this whole election.    So that is THE STORY of Monday October the 12th 2020. Very intense period we're coming into here with 22 days to go. So stay with us every night on THE STORY as we continue to cover it for you. We will see you back here tomorrow night at 7 o'clock. Good night everybody.    Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media LLC.

299,Is President Trump really immune from COVID-19 after negative test?," This is a rush transcript from “Your World with Neil Cavuto"" October 12 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Welcome to YOUR WORLD everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And what a crazy day all of it kind of pre-scripted if you will. We knew their positions. If you're a Democrat you don't like the idea that this is even going on right now. If you're a Republican you want to move fast just in case right now. So where do we stand on this? It was an opening day of everyone kind of stating their positions including Judge Barrett. But it's going to start getting nasty as soon as tomorrow. Doesn't Shannon Bream know it? The host of ""FOX News @ Night"" and a legal eagle unlike anyone I know on what happened today. Shannon what happened today? SHANNON BREAM FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey. Well Neil great to see you. It was day one. It's the opening day. All of these senators are sticking out their positions. We see the lines of attack the Democrats will try to use with Judge Barrett as she sat there silently until the very end of the day giving her side of the story. One of the things they're doing is attacking process. We heard this called a sham and unconstitutional but they're also going after key issues they know voters care about which includes the Affordable Care Act. So today Senator Blumenthal was among those who warned America that if Judge Barrett becomes Justice Barrett Obamacare is in trouble. Here's what he said: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT):  But now just one week after the election as you know the fate of the Affordable Care Act will be again in the hands of the United States Supreme Court. Republicans have turned again to the court to try to achieve judicially what they cannot achieve legislatively. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM:  Well and Senator Dick Durbin was even more direct. He said basically the president has picked you and is sending you to the High Court to kill the ACA. A lot of us out here who watched the court who really know about how these other justices think and how they're likely to vote think it's very unlikely that's actually what's going to happen. But it resonates with voters and with viewers because that is such a big issue. Now she got to make her case today Judge Barrett. She talked about acknowledging Justice Ginsburg and said:  I can never replace her. But I can step into these shoes and follow the path that she blazed being a wife being a mother and a top jurist. But of course she had her highest praise for the man she clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia. She has said she will follow his jurisprudence. Here is her talking about him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMY CONEY BARRETT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NOMINEE:  His judicial philosophy was straightforward. A judge must apply the law as it is written not as she wishes it were. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM:  All right so Neil it is all out there. The stakes have been laid. Everybody is ready tomorrow morning 9:00 a.m. The questioning starts. Judge Barrett said today she's heard from a lot of people around the country who say they're praying for her. She says:  I believe in the power of prayer. And starting tomorrow well probably everybody in that room is going to need a little bit of that Neil. CAVUTO:  Yes how did your kids do with this? I mean for hours they're enduring what their mom had to endure. How did that go? BREAM:  You know they were there sometimes. Sometimes they weren't in the room. But they came in and they all look like they're headed to church. They're perfectly dressed the boys in a suit and tie and the girls in dresses. (LAUGHTER) BREAM:  She talked about each of them. And it was really touching to hear her lay out their personalities and what they're all good at and what they're loved for and known for within the family. So a good moment for her to be able to personalize herself before the attacks start. The kids seemed very well-behaved. But they weren't there the whole time Neil. We may see them again tomorrow. CAVUTO:  Yes wouldn't be like my kids Shannon. I will just leave it at that. They'd be monsters. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO:  But Shannon thank you very very much for that. In the meantime let's go to Mariel Brookins former clerk to Judge Amy Coney Barrett back in 2017-2018. Mariel you know Judge Barrett well. And thank you for coming. I don't believe we have ever had at least in recent memory a justice with young school-age kids. Now we will have plenty if she makes it. Tell us about that part of her life because it was the first thing she talked about. MARIEL BROOKINS FORMER CLERK TO JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT:  Yes thank you for having me on. Judge Barrett would be the first Supreme Court justice with school-aged children. And I think that will absolutely bring a new dynamic to the court. Judge Barrett is open about how important her family is to her. And when I was clerking with her on the Seventh Circuit we would see her children. Occasionally her youngest would come into chambers with her and they would be there while we worked. And if that -- if she winds up as a justice on the Supreme Court I think that dynamic will be the same. Her family's a big part of her life. And that will of course continue. CAVUTO:  You know for her Circuit Court of Appeals nomination process she was used to badgering questioning and the whole religion dogma questioning. How did she hold up through that? I know you joined her after she became a judge. And I'm just wondering. She obviously knows what she's in for. She knows the attack lines probably has memorized them. How do you think she holds up? BROOKINS:  Well I think that we have seen this process is brutal no matter who the nominee is these days. But Judge Barrett has excellent composure Her Seventh Circuit confirmation hearing is just evidence of that. She was composed and gracious the entire time. She never snapped back at any of the senators notwithstanding some of the inappropriate questions. And I think we will see that same gracious composure over the next week even though the questioning and the badgering may be bad. CAVUTO:  As far as this timeline has she ever confided to you or talked to you yes I guess we can get this done before Election Day? It seems aggressive. But Republicans certainly are confident. Does she have any worries that you know of? BROOKINS:  Not that I know of. I think Judge Barrett is so focused on the law and not on the politics. Her dream is to be the best judge and the best jurist she can be. And I don't think she gets involved in politics. CAVUTO:  Yes I have a feeling you're right about that. Mariel thank you very much Mariel Brookins who clerked with the judge. I want to go to Ken Starr right now the former Whitewater independent counsel good read of the law and all things constitutional or not. So Ken good to be talking to you again my friend. This process can be very unseemly. And it seems over the years it's gotten even more so when you think that a Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg was approved what 96-3. That wasn't all that that long ago. But of course times have changed mightily. How do you think this process is going to go? The chairman of the committee Lindsey Graham is very confident the votes are all there and it will get wrapped up before Election Day. What do you think? KEN STARR FORMER SPECIAL PROSECUTOR:  It appears that way. It's going to be ugly but it's going to be ugly in a different way. I think and we hope and pray speaking of prayer than it was with Justice Kavanaugh. Think back to Justice Thomas. Let's face it confirmations for Supreme Court justices have become Stephen Carter of the Yale Law School put it many years ago a mess. And so how big of a mess is it going to be? At least today there weren't the kind of ad hominem attacks on the individual's character that we have seen including with Bob Bork so many years ago. But it's really become very political and insulting in one way. You're being put on the court Judge Barrett simply to overturn the Affordable Care Act. That is stuff and nonsense absolute nonsense. But it is politics. It's a political season. And frankly I think at this stage it's all the Democrats have. They don't have substantive arguments with her with respect to her qualifications her abilities her character. Look at those kids. She drives a minivan right with seven children. And the outpouring today by her former dean the dean emerita as Lindsey Graham said if I'm pronouncing that right the dean emerita was so powerfully saying I -- last time I testified was in favor of Elena Kagan and I'm here with the equal kind of confidence in the abilities and the character of this judge. CAVUTO:  Good point. I always think myself again if my dean at my school had to remember make first of all would say doesn't ring a bell doesn't -- the name doesn't ring a bell. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO:  But I was thinking of you Ken because there's a good profile of Merrick Garland in today's Washington Post. And of course he was Barack Obama's pick in his final year in office to try to get to the Supreme Court. We all know what happened. But it talked about how his profile has risen rather dramatically. He's seen as an elder statesman right now. But the point that got me near the end of the article was that now in his 60s he is unlikely to be called to become a Supreme Court justice no matter who's in the White House that they're erring on the side of young. So two things I took away from that A I will never be a Supreme Court justice. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO:  And B it's a young person's world. I guess they want people who are going to be there for a generation right? STARR:  Right. Ronald Reagan changed the whole dynamic the whole culture. Ronald Reagan one of our oldest presidents said let's go with the youth factor. So he wanted just as President Trump has done to appoint individuals -- and now here's Amy Coney Barrett who's in her late 40s -- who will be able to serve on the federal judiciary here the Supreme Court for an entire generation. CAVUTO:  Yes. STARR:  That is such an important legacy for any president. Ronald Reagan was the first to see that but now everyone has gotten the picture. CAVUTO:  Yes these young kids today Ken. I don't know. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO:  Thank you very very much. Good catching up with you on this. We will see how the whole process goes. Ken Starr on all of that. You always hear this term packing the Supreme Court packing the Supreme Court. As I was trying to raise this past weekend on our live show that all started with Franklin Roosevelt in 1937. He had won in a landslide in 1936. He was annoyed as all heck at the Supreme Court because a lot of the justices ruled down a lot of the things he wanted to do. So he said I have an idea. I'm going to pack this puppy and I'm going to try to add judges that will make it impossible for them to overrule me. Here's the thing that happened though. Not only did Republicans find it obnoxious but Democrats did as well. FDR learned his lesson. Now fast-forward to today. What is Joe Biden's view on all of this? Hard to know -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS:  More than nine million Americans have already voted and millions more will vote while this illegitimate committee process is under way. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO:  All right that Kamala Harris' way of saying this process to select a new Supreme Court associate justice is a sham because Americans should decide it. We're so close to the election. More than nine million have already voted by mail-in ballot. Why don't you that a chance? Of course that is not happening right now. But that is really campaign Biden's push right now. Less clear of course is how the campaign feels about this effort on the part of some Democrats to push for another FDR packing of the Supreme Court to load it up with liberal-minded justices that will prevent this from being a problem anymore in the future. That's their view. As to whether the Biden camp espouses that we don't know. They don't answer the question. Jacqui Heinrich now following team Biden and with us now from Wilmington Delaware -- Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey Neil. In Toledo Joe Biden made only a single mention of the Supreme Court confirmation hearings under way right now on Capitol Hill. And even then he mostly steered the focus away from Judge Barrett herself saying this nomination is about President Trump's crusade to eliminate his predecessor's health care plan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEPH BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Why do Republicans have time to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court providing -- instead of providing a significant economic need for localities? I will tell you why. It's about finally getting his wish to wipe out the Affordable Health Care Act. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEINRICH:  Republicans want to seize on any Democratic criticism of Judge Barrett over her faith because it breaks with the American standard of not judging folks based on religion. And Democrats did criticize Barrett on her faith during her appellate court hearings. And the Trump campaign has already made attack ads out of it. Today Joe Biden cautioned against a repeat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUESTION:  Should Judge Amy Coney Barrett's faith be considered by the Democrats during the hearing this week sir? BIDEN:  No her faith should not be considered. QUESTION:  There should be no questions about her faith? BIDEN:  None. I don't think there's any questions about her faith. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEINRICH:  But Biden's not been so direct about whether he would pack the court with more justices if Judge Barrett is confirmed saying he will answer after the election. Biden said President Trump wants his hypothetical future actions to be the focus instead of what Republicans are doing to pack the court ideologically right now with voting already under way. Biden has tried to frame this as unconstitutional saying voters are being robbed of their chance to weigh in on the process because voters make up the makeup of the next Senate. And he has repeatedly in all the times he has been asked about this shifted the focus off of him and back to the other party -- Neil. CAVUTO:  Jackie thank you very very much Jacqui Heinrich on all of that. All right I want to go to George Washington University constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley. Jonathan very good to have you. It's been a while. So thank you for joining me. JONATHAN TURLEY CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY:  Thank you. CAVUTO:  This process Jonathan as you know the Democrats say it's a sham shouldn't be happening and not right. One of the things they have been kicking around is this idea of if we get the Senate we're going to pack the court. Now of course Joe Biden and Kamala Harris haven't said anything on that subject and don't want to tip their hand. But do you think that would happen if they won and then Democrat seized the Senate that they would do that? TURLEY:  Well the concern is that what is a popular political sound bite can become a movement if you run on the issue and voters expect you to deliver. And various Democratic members and Kamala Harris herself suggested that this was a real option. And it's a curious way to honor the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg because she spoke vehemently against this type of proposal. She said it would effectively destroy the court. And it would. For about almost 30 years I have proposed the expansion of the Supreme Court. But that's over the course of about 20 years. That's different from packing the court to just dump five or six new members so you get an instant majority. That would do considerable violence to this institution. It would destroy any semblance of credibility which is what Ginsburg was referencing when she opposed this idea. CAVUTO:  You know it's been nine for a while now right the better part of a century. But I know there wasn't any magic to that number. There have been fewer. There been more. But we have gotten kind of used to this. So I guess what I'm asking you... TURLEY:  no Nine. CAVUTO:  ... is what is the -- what is the upside of this nine? TURLEY:  Well nine is -- it's basically an accidental number. We never had a great debate in this country as to the ideal size of the Supreme Court. And of course the Constitution does not set the size of the Supreme Court. We have had a smaller cord and a larger court. CAVUTO:  Right. TURLEY:  I actually believe that we should have a larger court but not like this. There's a difference between reforming and packing the court. What is being suggested today should be anathema. And that's what's so troubling about Joe Biden's position. This proposal is suggesting that it will destroy one of the key institutions in our constitutional system. And yet Biden is saying the voters are going to know his position after they vote. Well these are not supposed to be blind date elections. We're - - on an issue of this importance which was raised by the way by the Democrats not by the Republicans he really does have a duty to be clear as to where he stands. A lot of Americans will not vote for a candidate who even considers a court-packing plan. CAVUTO:  Do you think given his past statements and all -- I guess we're trying to divine tea leaves here but that they would be open to that that if they got in there and if they were to get a Senate majority -- I know these are both big leaps I'm talking about but that they would pursue this? TURLEY:  Well I'm always optimistic that there are mature minds that will come in. And after the election a lot of the overheated rhetoric tends to dissipate. We have already seen that in the Biden campaign where he has stepped back from the sort of position on the farther left to sort of more of a centrist position. So I'm hoping that that would be the case. But this is an age of rage. I mean we have no idea what it is going to be like after the election and who's going to be in Congress. CAVUTO:  Yes. TURLEY:  But the important thing is this is an idea that should be an affront to all Americans regardless of their party affiliation. And every candidate should be able to answer this question because it says something about their view of the Constitution. It also says whether they're willing to put principle ahead of politics. CAVUTO:  Yes very early. We shall see what happens. Jonathan very good catching up with you. Thank you for taking the time Jonathan Turley on all of this. TURLEY:  Thanks Neil. Good talking to you. All right in the meantime Chuck Grassley the former chair of this committee very influential Republican in his own right weighing in on this controversy and something called decorum that he's very worried about -- after this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R-IA):  I expect the minority will try to rustle up baseless claims and scare tactics as they have done for decades anything to derail the confirmation of a Republican nominee. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO:  All right three weeks from tomorrow Election Day and let the frequent flyer miles pile up. The president is going to be leaving for Florida very shortly also plans to take in North Carolina Iowa Pennsylvania today Joe Biden in Ohio. Nonstop. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO:  All right first day of remarks from Amy Barrett Coney Barrett by the way on Capitol Hill. But for the most part and with a mask on she would nod she would listen and she had to take in what were pretty long speeches from no fewer than what almost a couple of dozen senators either there directly or remotely 12 Republicans 10 Democrats. Kristin Fisher on how it all went. Hey Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey Neil. Well we will see if President Trump talks to the press about it in about 30 -- excuse me -- about 15 minutes when he had it -- the first chance to really talk to reporters under the wing of Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews. But we do know that President Trump was definitely watching day one of the confirmation hearings for his Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett. At one point Neil he even tweeted some advice to some Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He told them -- quote -- ""The Republicans are giving the Democrats a great deal of time which is not mandated to make their self-serving statements relative to our great new future Supreme Court justice."" So he clearly wasn't happy about that. But now President Trump is heading back out on the campaign trail for the very first time since testing positive for COVID-19. He says that he's feeling great. He believes that he's now immune to the virus. But the White House physician still has not put out a statement saying that President Trump has tested negative for COVID-19 ahead of tonight's big rally down in Florida. Then after that he's got another rally tomorrow in Pennsylvania Iowa on Wednesday North Carolina on Thursday four rallies in four days. Vice President Mike Pence spent the day campaigning in Ohio. Now he did talk about the confirmation hearing that was happening at the same time. And even though Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein did not repeat her now famous line ""The dogma lives loudly within you"" to Judge Barrett today the vice president made sure that voters did not forget it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I got news for the Democrats and their friends in Hollywood. That dogma lives loudly in me. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) PENCE:  That dogma lives loudly in you. And the right to live to work to worship according to the dictates of our faith and conscience lives in the Constitution of the United States of America! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) PENCE:  These attacks on religious faith must stop and they must stop now. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER:  Now while President Trump was sidelined with COVID the vice president took up a bit more spotlight than usual. But expect that to change. Jason Miller one of the president's senior campaign adviser says that the president was really getting on his case this morning for not having even more rallies more than the four rallies he's already having this week. So Jason Miller said in a call with reporters today to expect two to three campaign events a day Neil even more as we get closer to Election Day. CAVUTO:  Wow. That's a pretty hectic schedule for a guy who just got over COVID. FISHER:  Nonstop. CAVUTO:  All right thank you very -- yes I hear you Kristin. Thank you very very much. Want to go to Chuck Grassley on all of this right now the Iowa Republican the Senate Judiciary Committee much much more. They call him the senior member of the United States Senate. But he's -- he's not so senior to me. Anyway Senator Grassley very good to have you. How you doing? SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R-IA):  Very good. How are you doing? CAVUTO:  Very good. You touched on something that was on everyone's mind in your remarks  today with Judge Barrett this idea that it could get ugly it could get nasty. You reminded folks about a certain decorum that's kind of been lost over these last few nomination hearings. How do you think this one's going to go Senator? GRASSLEY:  Well it's going to go good from this standpoint. I think that the Democrats realize how qualified this person is and they can't in any way attack her there. So you heard a whole day of Democrats every one of them distracting and distorting because this nominee is so very well-qualified to be on the cart. And I think it's going to not be as bad as Kavanaugh but they're going to get into the weeds to scare every voter in America that your health insurance is going to be taken -- taken away from you on November the 10th. I think Biden said that today. Week after the election they're going to have this case brought up. He's a lawyer. He ought to know better than lie to the American people that this case won't be made public maybe for months down the road. And a lot of times they don't do it until the last couple weeks of June. So to lie to the American people to say on November the 10th your insurance is going to be taken away from you we just can't let that stand. And tomorrow we're going to have to as Republicans not only question her about the things we want to know about her and how she might handle certain cases but we... CAVUTO:  Yes. GRASSLEY:  We're going to have to use a lot of our time to keep them from lying about her. CAVUTO:  All right well we will see. I mean one of the first issues that the court would be taking up if she were to join it is a key provision of the Affordable Care Act that gets back to funding and all of that. But the problem for Republicans Senator as you know is that you never came up with an alternative plan of your own. You missed it by one vote when John McCain famously was thumbs down on a proposal that could have moved the ball forward. So Republicans are on defense on this issue. Are you concerned that just as it helped Democrats win the House a couple of years ago it's going to help them even more now? GRASSLEY:  No because there are so many issues in this campaign that are so much bigger than that. And one of them is dealing with what we're talking about today Biden not willing to tell people does he want to pack the court? And by packing the court I mean go above where it's been for 50 -- 150 years... CAVUTO:  Right. Right. GRASSLEY:  ... to a 10th 11th 12th 13th. He -- he says -- just like they did on Obamacare you remember Pelosi says we got to pass it to find out what's in it? You have got to either defeat Biden or elect him to find out what he's going to do about packing the court and change the Constitution very dramatically by making the Supreme Court what they want to be a super legislator as opposed to doing what the Supreme Court is supposed to do interpret law and not make law. CAVUTO:  All right Senator you think she can still be confirmed by Election Day? GRASSLEY:  Yes I'd say at least no later than the Tuesday one week before the election. CAVUTO:  Wow all right two weeks from tomorrow. We shall see. Chuck Grassley always good catching up with you. GRASSLEY:  Thank you. CAVUTO:  All right. In the meantime a quick peek at the corner of Wall and Broad stocks racing ahead today technology stocks. Now a lot of this was on optimism about earnings. They are looking pretty good. And they're expected to look a lot better than they used to say would be the case for the third quarter a little more than what a couple of months ago. But the real real lift here seems to be talk at least that they're still talking on stimulus and that something could be done because now they're only separated by a couple of hundred billion dollars. I mean that's a rounding error in change under couch cushions folks. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ALICIA ACUNA FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Well I bet you didn't expect to see me here. This is Alicia Acuna in Denver. We're taking a look at the Big Board right now. No stimulus deal but that's not bothering Wall Street right now. Take a look at the board right there. Neil Cavuto is having some technical issues right now so I will be taking over for just a little bit. We are going to right now get the read from Missouri Democratic Congressman Emanuel Cleaver joining us right now. Congressman thank you so much for being here. Let's begin first talking about COVID relief talks. Things are at an impasse right now. Where do -- where should Americans think this is going to be headed for them? REP. EMANUEL CLEAVER (D-MO):  Well the good news is that Secretary Mnuchin and Speaker Pelosi are still having communications. They are -- they're still talking. I think both of them recognize as the three previous chairs of the Fed Jay Powell Bernanke both have said this is something we have to do quickly and that we ought to go big. So they're continuing to talk. I think there was something encouraging that the president did but I'm not sure you know what it means because he says one thing one day and then he changes. But he's saying now we need to go big as well. Well that was - - that was followed by him saying we need to discontinue any talks until after the election. But the American public is struggling. I mean it's not -- and I don't mean Democrats. I mean Americans Republicans Democrats independents vegetarians Oakland Raider fans. I mean everybody is saying... ACUNA:  Right. CLEAVER:  ... that we have got to have something. And they're struggling. I have just had a meeting Zoom meeting with bankers my bankers. And they're saying look we have got to have this spending bill or it's going to do enormous damage and take us much longer to get out of the hole. ACUNA:  But the president still has to do some convincing on his own party's side. You have a number of Republicans in the Senate who are still frustrated by what the president has brought up. But then we also had -- over the weekend we had the White House chief of staff we had the Treasury secretary saying look we're calling on Congress let's get this done let's begin with the PPP let's do that. However nothing has moved yet. And I know that the airwaves today have been filled with the Supreme Court nomination. However this is something Americans are waiting on every day hour by hour. What is going to move this along? CLEAVER:  Well I agree with you. I agree with everything you just said. And I think most Americans agree with what you just said. And I hope they also agree with the fact that we need a holistic approach to this. We can't start parceling out pieces because that's going to do damage to many of my constituents. In other words we can't say well let's take care of the airlines and then we will take care of the payroll protection program later. We have to do everything and we need to do it as quickly as we can. I would say to the American public that I think that the problem is here. We can pass the bill the president -- what the president wants but it will mean that Republicans and Democrats will have to vote together. It'll be a bill where there may be and particularly in the House more Democrats voting for it than Republicans. And I think that's a political picture that some Republicans don't care to share out in the greater universe. But that may be the only way we're going to get something substantial passed. And I would rather have both sides bending as opposed to breaking the heart of the American public. And I think that's what's going on now. People are out here hurting and crying. ACUNA:  Right. CLEAVER:  Members of Congress are -- well we're -- I'm not involved in the negotiations but I express my position. And I think everybody on both sides of the aisle probably should do the same express their position. We need to get something done and done quickly. ACUNA:  Well Americans definitely are waiting for some good news here. And while I have you here I would like to get your thoughts on how you thought things went. We're just at the beginning of the week here for Judge Amy Coney Barrett. But I wanted to know what you thought. How do you feel Democrats are doing right now in this hearing? And do they -- are they walking a fine line this week? They got to be careful. She seems to be doing well. CLEAVER:  Yes I haven't watched much of it. But I kept hearing people saying that there are those who are attacking her -- attacking her religion which I haven't heard. And unlike some of my colleagues if I hear somebody attacking her religion I won't be saying I wouldn't do it I would have never said it. I will condemn it. I'm an ordained United Methodist pastor with three years of seminary. I have a master's degree in theology. I respect every religion every faith tradition. And if somebody is attacking her religion that's -- in fact I just made a phone call and said hey I keep hearing people the Republicans saying that. Can somebody tell me who it was? So -- and I'm going to try to figure that out. I will hopefully get some more information about it. ACUNA:  Congressman thank you very much -- well I -- we really appreciate your time. I know you were expecting to talk to Neil Cavuto but you're talking to little old me in Denver. I appreciate the time. Thank you so much. CLEAVER:  Sure. Good to be with you. ACUNA:  Thank you. Twenty years ago the USS Cole was attacked in a port in Yemen killing 17 sailors. Today we remember those lost that day and also those sailors who fought to save the ship. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO:  Twenty years ago today what some call the precursor of the modern-day terrorist attacks on the United States that would come 11 months later at the World Trade Center. Well it all began 20 years ago today when the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen was attacked by Al Qaeda terrorists in a speedboat. It ultimately killed 17 sailors wounded another 37. And it was the opening salvo some say the continuing salvo in a terror war that continues to this day. Kirk Lippold the commander of USS Cole joins us right now. Commander very good to have you. If you think about what you and your men and women endured that day and what it would trigger a little more than 11 months later and in countless attacks back and forth since what do you think? KIRK LIPPOLD FORMER COMMANDER USS COLE:  Well Neil it was one of those where the attack on USS Cole really was the start because up until that point whether it had been World Trade Center 1 Khobar Towers the embassies in Africa they were attacked by terrorist organizations against buildings that housed and represented U.S. interest. Cole was actually -- the attack on Cole was an attempt to prevent us from defending those interests. And when you try to take away a nation's ability to defend itself it's an act of war that unfortunately because of the mind-set of the American people in the political class at the time they missed it. And so unfortunately we suffered through 9/11 11 months later. CAVUTO:  Was there any -- did it absorb it? When you see these guys coming up in what look like motorized dinghy that they wished harm? Anything to tip you off? LIPPOLD:  There was no indication. The morning we pulled in for a brief stop for fuel as part of routine harbor operations we contracted for three garbage barges to take off trash plastic and hazmat. Two boats came out one to the middle of the ship one to the back of the ship by the flight deck. They left and were halfway across the harbor when a boat that looked exactly like they did about 24-foot-long center console outboard motor with to two people in it came down by the bow came right to the middle of the ship -- that's how it was inside the security perimeter -- and detonated as a waterborne improvised explosive device which the Navy had no intelligence on we'd never trained for. And consequently that explosion would kill 17 and wound 37. But the crew responded as true heroes and valiantly and immediately went out to save that ship and their shipmates. CAVUTO:  Just amazing. That was an Al Qaeda-sourced attack. Al Qaeda and host of others from the Taliban to ISIS have emerged different names same goal same perversions. We like to say now we have got ISIS on the run and this isn't a problem anymore. You have always reminded me they're like cockroaches. They come up in different forms shapes and in different locales. Are you still worried about that? LIPPOLD:  I'm very much concerned. I think unlike the mind-set back then I think that Americans now realize there's no such thing as a non-state sponsor of terrorism. All these international terrorist organizations have state sponsors somewhere that allow them to recruit to conduct operations to do financing get arms. And so consequently it's going back to some of these governments that have supported it. One that recently decided to change its mind and turned around has been Sudan which there was a lawsuit by some of the Cole survivors that have done that. But the reality is we need to hold governments accountable. And when we as the United States do that that is where you go to the core and the route of finding terrorists and cutting them off at the knees so that they literally don't have the capability to do harm not only to the United States but our allies in other countries around the world. CAVUTO:  Yes you're right about that. Commander it all started with your fine men and women your command. And what you saw then and telegraphed then we're very familiar with some two decades later. Commander thank you very very much. LIPPOLD:  Well thank you Neil. It was an absolute honor to be at that ceremony today to not only remember the 17 sailors we lost but to truly honor the crew that saved that ship where USS Cole is out there still defending freedom today and getting ready for another deployment. Those young men and women have inherited that legacy. And they're carrying on in the finest traditions of the United States Navy. CAVUTO:  You're right. And it's alive and well Commander. Thank you very very much. Stay with us. LIPPOLD:  Thank you Neil. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO:  All right the president off to Florida right now. He's going to be busy. But Florida is an important tipoff as the president plans his first outside Washington area campaign appearance since testing positive for COVID. David Paleologos joins us right now from Suffolk University good read of all things politics and where we stand right now. David the polls show it's still pretty tight in the Sunshine State. The RealClear average still gives the edge to Joe Biden but anything could happen. What's your sort of lay of the Florida state right now? DAVID PALEOLOGOS SUFFOLK UNIVERSITY:  So in our poll we have a 45-45 percent tie. But in our poll we listed all seven of the candidates who are certified for the Florida ballot. That may come into play if the race is 45-45. CAVUTO:  So when you look at Florida right now -- and obviously it was dealing with a spike in COVID cases. They eased a little bit. Some people say this is a call -- judgment call on the Florida governor and whether he screwed things up earlier on. Things seem to be stabilizing a little bit. What's your read of the state right now? PALEOLOGOS:  Most people are supportive of what Governor DeSantis did and a majority in this poll. And it also shows how important as you mentioned that I-4 Corridor is. CAVUTO:  Yes. PALEOLOGOS:  When you think about the differences between the Space Coast and Daytona on the East Coast and obviously the Sarasota area the Gulf Coast so that stretch of people -- and it's no surprise that Trump is going out to Florida to those areas because they have higher-than-average independents. And those will make the difference in this election. CAVUTO:  The quiet vote the Trump vote we hear so much about what do you think of that in states like Florida and elsewhere that the president argues is understated people don't appreciate that there's a lot out there? PALEOLOGOS:  Yes well there could be high undecided -- in the high undecided or in the third-party candidates but also in what we call the non-response bias which is Trump voters don't participate in polls. I'm less inclined to believe that. I think that in the last election we had higher-than-average in undecideds higher than average in the third- party candidates. But you don't have a Green Party candidate. Most of the ballots have a Libertarian. CAVUTO:  All right. PALEOLOGOS:  But as I say you have got this candidate in Florida and other candidates that are going to matter if the race is close. CAVUTO:  David thank you very very much. I also want to thank Alicia Acuna for coming in at the last second. What a pro. Sorry about that. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

300,Grassley: Democrats know Barrett's qualifications are not an issue," Oct. 13 2020 – This is a rush transcript from “The Ingraham Angle” October 13 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM FOX NEWS HOST: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. I have to tell you if you missed Trump tonight in Pennsylvania you missed a doozy. He is back in a big way. And now the rallies are drawing parallels with Biden in a way that well really matters.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: My goal is not to make friends in the D.C. swamp. My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family.   Biden wins your borders are gone which means your health care is gone. The middle class is gone and your safety is gone. Other than that you'll be doing very nicely (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Other than that things will be rosy. All right. Well he just came out and now what 10 days 12 days after the COVID diagnosis unbelievable strength vibrancy. Did he lose a little weight? That's what someone texted me I'm not sure. But he looked pretty great and he sounded even better. And can't be matched when you see this pathetic Florida showing earlier today of Joe Biden. I'm going to hit this a little bit later on THE ANGLE.   Also day two of Amy Coney Barrett's hearings they're in the books. Now a full breakdown from a senator there today. And the best legal discussion bar none in the business. And by the way Nancy Pelosi if you didn't see this she's totally losing it. She actually accused Wolf Blitzer of essentially being a member of the vast Right-wing conspiracy. Yes. Newt Gingrich takes it all apart later in the hour.  But first Trump and the Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett boy back on Capitol Hill for day two of her confirmation hearings and since Democrats cannot contest her qualifications or certainly match her intellect they decided to launch this series of desperate attacks and smear attempts. Senator Mazie Hirono never mistaken for well someone with any lucidity led with the absurd Kavanaugh esq line of questioning.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): Since you became a legal adult have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature?   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Did someone mix up her notes from Kavanaugh hearing. What was that? Senator Klobuchar actually engaged in legal arguments with Barrett but that too backfired.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): Is Roe a super precedent?   AMY CONEY BARRET SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: How would you define super precedent?  KLOBUCHAR: I actually I might but someday I'd be sitting in that chair.  I'm not - I'm up here so I'm asking you.  BARRETT: Well people use super precedent differently. I'm answering a lot of questions about Roe which I think indicates that Roe doesn't fall in that category.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Oh! My gosh. That's a problem when someone else writes your questions for you. So like I don't know what do you think. Well Senator Feinstein she employed a sickening tactic of using Barrett's personal life to kind of figure out a way to back into why she should support I don't know abortion.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA): You don't have a magic formula for how you do it and handle all the children and your job and your work and your thought process which is obviously excellent. Do you?  BARRETT: It's improv.  FEINSTEIN: Yes yes. Well let me begin with a question that the chairman touched on and it's of great importance I think because it goes to a woman's fundamental right to make the most personal decisions about their own body.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: That was quite a segue. You have a beautiful family let's move on to abortion and no confirmation hearing would be complete without loaded racial questions from Spartacus himself.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): I want to just ask you very simply; I imagine you'll give me a very short resolute answer. But you condemn white supremacy correct.  BARRETT: Yes. BOOKER: Thank you. I'm glad to see that you said that.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: This is - I dipped in and out of this throughout the day and it seemed to get worse as the day went on not exactly representing the highest decorum or what should be the ideal Supreme Court confirmation line of questioning. And we wanted to show you these sound bites tonight to demonstrate the utter shallowness and the callousness of the Democrats posture in the age of Trump.  Joining me now is a senator who sat through the entire saga today Marsha Blackburn Senate Judiciary Committee member great state of Tennessee.  Senator Blackburn you know when I watched Judge Barrett the way she handled herself of course we all know she had no notes in front of her unlike the senators who can't utter a syllable without a staffer having written a question.  The calm she displayed the legal intellect the poise. What a stark contrast to the Democrats asking about white supremacy and comparing her children to the abortion process. I mean the whole thing was just frankly disgusting.   SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): Well you're right and you look at the arrogance of Dianne Feinstein or how condescending Senator Leahy was to her Klobuchar so emotional Hirono so dismissive Harris very combative and she never got flustered. She never was ruffled. And here is the thing I think she's well-prepared Laura for knowing that the Left is always going to denigrate and dismiss and ridicule and mock a conservative woman. They know that.  Amy Coney Barrett knows that. And I think she was prepared for what they were going to do and how they were going to come with their questioning.  And quite frankly the way they tried to build out the Affordable Care Act argument and tilt everything to health care and then create a national panic saying people are terrified.  They were projecting their fears onto the American people saying the American people are terrified they're scared they're frightened. They're trying to create this panic and say she is going to take their health care away which is not true. And I will tell you Laura their numbers they keep inflating these numbers on health care they grow bigger every day.   INGRAHAM: Well I think what they're doing with a hearing it seems to me senator is they know she's going to get confirmed. They know she runs circles around them and intellect and knowledge and the ability to think on her feet. She doesn't need someone prepping her and written questions I mean Patsy Baloney did a phenomenal job in prepping her. But she's brilliant and they know that. So what they're doing is they're using this as an extension of the Biden campaign. We're not watching a confirmation hearing.  BLACKBURN: That's right.  INGRAHAM: We're watching the Biden campaign in all of its desperate tactics.   BLACKBURN: You're exactly right and that's why they keep saying 150 million people will lose their health care if Obamacare is repealed. Here's the truth. 8.3 million Americans are in the Obamacare marketplace 8.3 million. You've got 57 million that are on Medicare. You've got 153 million people that have private health insurance. You've got 66 million on Medicaid. So where they come up with these numbers and they never say.  If we get our way if we get socialized medicine then 153 million of you are going to lose your private health insurance because they look at Obamacare and by the way Obamacare is not the issue thereafter. They don't want to constitutionalist judge on the Supreme Court who might block them from doing socialized medicine Green New Deal D.C. state-- INGRAHAM: They're going to pack the court anyway.  BLACKBURN: Abolishing the Electoral College.   INGRAHAM: This is all goofy anyway. They're going to pack the court. Biden knows that's what the AOC and the gang are going to demand and that's what they're going to do. Now I want to play this exchange Senator between Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana and Judge Barrett. Check it out.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): Some butt head professor at Boston University says that because you and your husband have two children of color that you're a white colonist and that you used your two children as props.   BARRETT: It was the risk of people saying things like that. My husband and I had to really weigh the costs of this. It was saying deeply offensive and hurtful things things that are not only hurtful to me but are hurtful to my children who are my children who we love. Accusations like that are cruel.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Senator Blackburn very quickly those are the compassionate pro- child pro-women party we're supposed to believe in.   BLACKBURN: Well and we know that the Left if you do not kowtow to their agenda then you are less than fully female in their book because you don't go for their pro-choice liberal leftist narrative. And this is the closest that Judge Barrett got to emotion during the course of the day. But it is despicable that people would go after their relationship. They're bringing these children into their family. The fact that they have adopted these children.  Laura it is absolutely horrific and it is upsetting to hear it. They should be saying thank goodness there are people that will take children that are needing a home and will bless them with a family a family life.  INGRAHAM: Well as the mother of three adopted children myself internationally adopted.  BLACKBURN: Right.  INGRAHAM: I took that very personally for her and she was phenomenal. She is going to be an amazing justice on the court.   BLACKBURN: Yes.  INGRAHAM: Senator thank you for sitting through that.  BLACKBURN: Yes she is.  INGRAHAM: And asking great questions today. We'll be watching as it unfolds. Thanks for joining us tonight.  BLACKBURN: Thank you Laura.   INGRAHAM: And joining me now to break it all down Robert Dunn attorney former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas the great and also Harmeet Dhillon Civil Rights Attorney Lawyers for Trump national co- chair. Robert let's get right into it. Barrett laid down the marker early on in the day.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BARRETT: I haven't even written anything that I would think anybody could reasonably say this is how she might resolve an election dispute and I would consider it. Let's see. I certainly hope that all members of the committee have more confidence in my integrity than to think that I would allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Robert this is likely what led to the Dems on the dais there lashing out like we just showed.   ROBERT DUNN CLERKED FOR JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS: Yes they are terrified that she's going to rule against them on an election case and that she is somehow a secret agent that Trump is set onto the court. And I don't think she could be any more clear that she owes Trump nothing. And the American people need to know the moment that she is confirmed. He has no power over her at all. He can't fire her. He can't reduce her pay. And every Republican president in my lifetime and going back before that has regretted one of their nominations when a decision is gone against them.  And I think someone quoted Senator Truman saying the moment a justice is confirmed they're no longer your friend. That very well could be true for President Trump if he gets another four years he may have a dinner where he's cursing her name because he lost a case. But she doesn't owe him anything. And she's going to rule impartially. That's who she is and that's what she'll do so.   INGRAHAM: So impressive. Harmeet you've been tracking Kamala Harris's idiocy on the campaign trail for months now even when she was in the primary and got her clock cleaned. But today in her remote location she made an attempt to be relevant. And there was one moment in particular that struck me and this is when she talked about well let's not pretend that we don't know the way Amy really feels. Watch.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Were you aware of President Trump's statements committing to nominate judges who will strike down the Affordable Care Act? And I appreciate a yes or no answer please.  BARRETT: I don't recall seeing those statements.  HARRIS: Well I imagine you were surrounded by a team of folks that helped prepare you for this nomination hearing.  BARRETT: I've had - yes.  HARRIS: Let me finish if you don't mind.  BARRETT: I'm so sorry.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: She tried to pull that little let me finish thing like she did at the debate to a spectacular fail Harmeet.  HARMEET DHILLON CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: That's her reflex. Her reflex is to play the victim and be put upon. And also that kind of bullying bossy mannerism that she has that's so grating and that grating voice and that grating fake demeanor. So I think overall even though Kamala Harris apparently mistook this hearing about a Supreme Court nominee as a campaign opportunity because she spoke for about 95 percent of the 44 minutes or so today on a monologue about the Affordable Care Act and a couple of other issues.  She did herself no favors I think and she showed herself to be an inept cross examiner. I mean the big buildup to these hearings as they were with the Kavanaugh hearing she's such a great cross-examine or she's going to slay her - she couldn't cross-examine her way out of a paper bag. I think Rob and I would both agree with that. It was really quite pathetic and the witness really ran circles around her there. It was something to see Laura.   INGRAHAM: Robert I want to play another Harris because come on this was really about the Biden campaign. It was not about the confirmation hearing.  She made another bizarre statement during the hearing. Watch.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  HARRIS: Considers filling the seat of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who is straightforward enough in her confirmation hearing to say that the right to choose is essential to a woman's equality. I would suggest that we not pretend that we don't know how this nominee views a woman's right to choose.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Robert we have Amy Coney Barrett who doesn't have a note in front of her and we have Kamala Harris who could be President of the United States given Biden's condition if he wins doing this. And I would suggest that we not pretend I mean it was unbelievable.   DUNN: It was. And I think her answers were consistent. She got a variation of that question all throughout the day really. And she was very clear.  She respects Roe and Casey as precedent. She doesn't consider them super precedent as some of the Democrat senators tried to force her to call it.  And she's going to take every case that comes before her. And they may not like some of the results. They may be surprised in a pleasant way for some of the results because she isn't just going in there and doing the pope's bidding.  This attack has been launched on every Catholic justice. As you know Laura Justice Thomas is a devout Catholic. And the one thing he's never been accused of is being a tool of the Vatican. He's been accused of a lot of things but being a tool of the Vatican isn't one of them. And if you ever came in to Justice Thomas Chambers and said well there's a papal encyclical that totally answers this abortion question he would look at you like you were out of your damn mind and tell you to go back and redo your bench memo. And she's going to be the same way. She's not going to just do what she thinks is right. That's not who she is.   INGRAHAM: All right. Just for fun OK? We have to have fun with this. There was a moment where the socially distanced I guess it was Leahy. Senator Leahy had a little bit of a problem. Harmeet watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT): Do you know how many Republicans on this committee have joined amicus briefs urging Congress to overturn the ACA and FIB vs. Sebelius and King vs. Burwell  BARRETT: I'm having a little bit of trouble hearing Senator Leahy. Is there a way for the volume to be turned up?   UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes ma'am.  LEAHY: I am sorry for that. How is it coming through now?   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Harmeet that was all part of the COVID's here COVID's here be afraid don't go into the hearing room. Come on. Real quick.   DHILLON: Well the whole thing today was a comedy of errors. And it showed first of all as time and again in many other settings our senators don't know how to use technology. Kamala Harris had that problem yesterday with the Zoom boom voice from hell. But overall it was a poor showing. We really expect better from our senators. They should be better prepared. And if they don't have something productive to say we should move on.  I heard Kamala Harris talk a lot about it's only 16 days or cramming it through. But she wasted 95 percent of her time talking about something totally off point. So they have plenty of time to do this. It wasn't even about Amy Coney Barrett at all today.   INGRAHAM: No this was an extension of the Biden campaign. He's not doing many campaign appearances. So the committee was doing it for him the Democrats. Robert Harmeet wonderful appearance with both of you. Now in moments my angle very clearly lays out why Trump's COVID response has actually saved the country. And then presidential COVID adviser Dr. Scott Atlas will respond. Stay there.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  INGRAHAM: A Trump or Biden economy that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.  Now the World Health Organization has finally confirmed what we at the anger angle have been telling you for months that COVID lockdowns are horribly destructive especially to the poor. Now in light of this it's time for another reality check and to realize how fortunate we are that Trump was in-charge before during and after the pandemic hit.  The politicized expert class has been wrong more than right. And President Trump was smart enough to follow his own America first instincts instead of their America last default. And if the pro-Biden media toadies if they think that THE ANGLE is going to let them get off the hook for their idiocy think again because it's flashback time.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If we can show this graph of the United States versus the European Union.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Europe has suppressed the virus and we have not.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Europe crushed the curve to where it's now well below the U.S. and stable.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Well that stability didn't last long. European nations entered lengthy lockdowns and now they are experiencing a massive surge of COVID cases and even deaths. Well we're steadily improving. We have been since about July. The only thing Europe crushed was its economy.  The IMF's new GDP loss projections vindicate Trump's pro-America story. As you can see the U.S. beats every other G7 member nation in managing the COVID fallout. Had we listened to Team Biden we'd look like the UK France or Italy total disasters look at those numbers. You can take them off the screen. All right.  Well the Eurozone as a whole lost a whopping 8.3 percent. Had we followed their lead; our economy would have lost. We did the calculation today about $1.6 trillion instead of the 815 billion hits that we did take. Now look it wasn't pleasant but Trump's reaction his policies saved us from a $770 billion loss. That's more than the GDP of Ohio. That's like taking Ohio out of our country for a year.  OK but what about the future now? Let's look at that. Well under Trump it's so bright as the song goes well you'd have to wear shades. Third quarter growth is going to be record setting. Annualized I think it's about 32 percent. And it would have been even higher if the petty tyrants running the blue states weren't dragging their feet on reopening their economies. Hello California.  Now according to The Spectator 14 out of the top 16 strongest economic recoveries are occurring and Republican led states with conservative policies. Thank you very much. Or 12 out of 16 of the weakest recoveries are occurring in Democratic led states of course. Then why doesn't the press ask Biden about any of this because they're acting as his comms team that's why. Biden has no answer for any of this. God bless them because there is no answer for this and he's losing it. He's locked down tax and regulate approach to governance will lead us to financial ruin people. He will punish success and reward failure.  Now the most persuasive case that Donald Trump and his surrogates can make for his reelection it's the economic one it really is and he did this he did this he nailed this tonight in Pennsylvania.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: In my first three years in office family income increased by $6000 more than five times the gains in all eight years of the Obama administration. After our tax cuts took effect wages for the lowest income Americans grew twice as fast as those near the top. African American income grew nine not two not three nine times more. And these are out of the book.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: The crowd was wild because this is success you cannot debate it just the jobs numbers and wage increases from Trump's first three years in office should be enough to convince every voter in America to support him.  And what's Biden's answer to all this?   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  KYLE INSKEEP WKRC REPORTER: A Gallup reported last week 56 percent of Americans said that they were better off today than they were four years ago. So why should people who feel that they are better off today under the Trump administration vote for you?  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well if they think that they probably shouldn't. Their memory is not very good quite frankly.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Wait a second. Is Biden questioning other people's memories?  Didn't he just forget Mitt Romney's name? On nearly every key economic and COVID issue Donald Trump has been proven correct and Biden proven wrong.  And Biden by the way never learns he just mumbles bromides about unity and dignity and his handlers meanwhile plot to tear down what we love and to rob you of everything you've worked so hard for.  I was thinking about this today those - I know this I know a lot of people out there feel this way. They feel like well Trump's a bully. He's too tough around the edges rough around the edges. Those who call him a bully should remember what he's accomplished for them despite what he's been up against from day one the deep state corrupt Comey the Mueller investigation the Obama's the Clinton's George Soros a phony impeachment the pro-China crowd on Wall Street big tech billionaires medical experts acting as political assassins woke celebrities and sports and Hollywood academia and of course a dishonest Far Left hateful press.   So the real bullies they'll be people like Gretchen Whitmer or maybe Andrew Cuomo or J.B. Pritzker. And they'll perhaps be running a Biden DOJ or an EPA Department of Education and DHS. If Biden wins you'll not only be pining for the good old days of record setting wage growth but for the fighter who against all odds achieved great things for America.  And that's THE ANGLE.  Joining me is White House COVID advisor Dr. Scott Atlas. Dr. Atlas do you believe that should Biden win his experts will urge if there are COVID cases popping in January urge us to lock down again?  DR. SCOTT ATLAS ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Hey Laura. Thanks for having me.  Well anyone who is talking about doing another lockdown has really not been paying attention for the last seven months and is simply out of touch with average Americans because the lockdowns have been -- the prolonged lockdowns are a complete disaster. They're a complete disaster for missed health care. They're a complete disaster for average working families and particularly for people who are working-class and lower-income people.  People have been killed by people who want to have prolonged lockdowns and when I say ""killed"" I look at the data. And that means for instance this week it was shown 46 percent of the most common types of cancers were not diagnosed during the lockdown. Those cancers didn't disappear. They're there. People will present with much later more widespread disease. Half of people who had chemotherapy appointments didn't show up. That's 650000 Americans. Half of people who had immunizations for children didn't come in out of the fear instilled by our so-called public health experts.  You could go on and on -- 40 percent of people with acute strokes. And this is devastating. When you close schools just schools alone we had more than 200000 cases of child abuse not reported during the two months of spring school closures. And now we're in a situation where one out of four college age Americans have contemplated killing themselves during the month of June. That's a CDC report. This is completely off the rails and it's much worse not for the elites who are sipping lattes working for a tech couple of company where I live in Silicon Valley but for people who are average working-class Americans they are destroyed by prolonged lockdowns. Anyone who says there should be a prolonged lockdown --  INGRAHAM:  Hold on Dr. Atlas. Why don't we hear Dr. Fauci ever addressing the larger American patient? Do you ever ask him that? Do you ever talk to him and say you never talk about these other circumstances that have been created by these lockdowns? And I'm telling you this guy Peter Hotez on CNN today he's a vaccine developer. He said get ready I'm telling my own family get ready for lockdowns this winter. That's what they're saying.  ATLAS:  I can say this -- history will record the faces of the public health expertise as some of the most sinful egregious epic failures in the history of public policy. They have killed people with their lack of understanding and their lack of caring about not just the impact of cases of COVID-19 a virus that the overwhelming majority of people do well in notwithstanding of course we're not underestimating 200000 Americans who died. That's tragic but these people have been a gross failure because they never cared to consider the impact of the policy itself. And the policy itself has been a complete epic failure and honestly some people say a crime against humanity. These people should be held accountable to what they said.  INGRAHAM:  On a scale of one to 10 10 being the strongest one being the weakest how do you rate Donald Trump's recovery from COVID?  ATLAS:  Listen the facts speak for themselves. It's not a political statement. It's a data-based statement. The president was caught blindsided. The country the world was caught blindsided and there was an immediate mobilization of resources. There was a stockpile created out of nothing --  INGRAHAM:  All right but one to 10. We've got to go Scott. One to 10.  ATLAS:  OK you've got to go 10. I'm sorry. I like to go through details but you're going to force me to say it I'll say a 10.  INGRAHAM:  All right I just saw him tonight in Pennsylvania. Unbelievable.  He looked stronger than ever. So Dr. Atlas sorry to cut you off but thank you so much for joining us tonight. And Nancy Pelosi by the way if you missed it she completely lost her mind on CNN. The tape the reaction Newt Gingrich in moments.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM:  Nancy Pelosi probably agreed to appear on CNN today thinking it was just going to be another usual softball interview from America's leading anti-Trump propaganda outfit. But it quickly devolved into an epic meltdown.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WOLF BLITZER CNN ANCHOR:  Even members of your own caucus Madam Speaker accept this deal $1.8 trillion.  REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA) HOUSE SPEAKER:  I don't know why you're always an apologist and many of your colleagues apologists for the Republican position. Do you have any idea what the difference is between the spending that they have in their bill and that we have in our bill?  BLITZER:  It's not everything you want. But there is a lot there.  PELOSI:  Honest to God. You really I can't get over it. You really don't know what you're talking about.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  The speaker is not well or is a challenge in the offing?  Joining me now Newt Gingrich former Speaker of the House author of ""Trump and the American Future"" fantastic book. Newt why do you think Pelosi was so thrown off by that line of questioning of not taking $1.8 trillion I choke when I say that trillion dollar deal?  NEWT GINGRICH (R) FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Look I think that she is not used to anybody challenging her anymore. She lives in a bubble. She lives in a world where if she's caught cheating on wearing a mask and going into a beauty salon that's supposed to be closed it must be somebody else's fault. It was an ambush. It was set up to hurt her. When members of her caucus don't get it it's because they're stupid because she's brilliant.  And I think she's very fragile at this stage and I think that it's interesting to watch. If you think about it if you're going to have a leadership of Pelosi Schumer and Biden -- talk about people who have some amazing length of time in Washington all of whom are at a point in life where they get irritable and edgy. And that's why you have Biden at times blowing up at reporters and blowing up telling people if you're not for me you're not black comments that 10 years ago he would never have made.  And she's in the same boat. She may be frankly -- her past-due date may have already expired.  (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM:  Newt here is more because this was such a special moment for Nancy. Here is more from the on-air meltdown.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WOLF BLITZER CNN ANCHOR:  It's about millions of Americans who can't put food on the tables who can't pay their rent and who are having trouble --  REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA) HOUSE SPEAKER:  And we represent them. And we represent them. And we represent them.  Thank you for your sensitivity to our constituents' needs.  BLITZER:  I am sensitive to them because I see them on the street begging for food begging for money. Madam Speaker thank you so much. PELOSI:  Have you fed them? We feed them we feed them.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  Newt I was clutching my side I was laughing so hard. She's not long for the Speaker's world. I think this is a sign that even if they hold the House I'm not sure Nancy is going to be Speaker of the House in the new term.  GINGRICH:  Sure she wouldn't. It's about raw power. Look Pelosi is a person who could with no sense of irony be standing in front of a $24000 refrigerator eating $12 a pint ice cream and expressing her concern for poor Americans. She has no sense of irony. She can live in a protected enclave and think it's OK to defund the police and not see any contradiction in the size of her security patrol and the fact that she wants to leave average citizens without any police.  This is the beginning of the California liberalism -- remember you have a vice presidential candidate from San Francisco the Speaker of the House from San Francisco and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate from San Francisco. And then the governor of California is from San Francisco. For a city that can't collect human feces off the street that is an extraordinary level of political power that has accrued to a city which is failing. And so I think they just live in a fantasy land. But they really live there. INGRAHAM:  I'm not going to play another soundbite from that exchange because I think we get it now. But I do Newt want to ask you about the importance of Republicans trying to take back the House of Representatives.  You came along in 1994 and changed the world the first time the Republicans had the House in several decades. You were able to do it with a midterm election. It's not out of the realm of possibility here and I don't think people should give up on that.  GINGRICH:  No. In fact I think the fact is that if Trump continues to campaign as well as he did tonight in Pennsylvania and continues to make the case on the big issues and gets off all the minor stuff I think that he can beat Biden by a big margin and I think in the process we'll take back the House and more than keep the Senate maybe increase the Senate.  The key for the Trump campaign frankly is to get on these big issues such as the Biden depression versus the Trump recovery and stay on them and not get down into the weeds and not get drawn off onto things. The news media works every day to get Trump to say something that doesn't get his main point across so they can avoid covering how bad Biden is and Trump all too often plays into that. He needs to focus on the big choices in which case three weeks from now we're going to have an astonishing election.  INGRAHAM:  Newt I could not think of anyone better to have on tonight.  Thank you so much for joining us. Great to see you. And still ahead a Biden institution would institutionalize a level of grifting or grift not seen since I don't know maybe the Clinton days.  And who stands to profit the most? Biden's own family of course. Dinesh D'Souza explains it all in moments.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM:  For all the baseless talk about how the Trump family has monetized all their time in D.C. you think that the media would be worried about the unprecedented level of grift that a Biden administration would bring. Political profiteering seems to be kind of a Biden family tradition.  We already know about Hunter Biden's shady deals at home in China and Ukraine and he got of course the $3.5 million from that former mayor of Moscow's wife. But then there's his sister. Have you heard of Ashley Biden?  While her dad was V.P. the nonprofit she worked for got a huge federal grant in September 2014. Two months later she got a big promotion.  Then there is Ashley's husband Howard Krein and her brother-in-law Steven Krein. They run an investment company with $1 million worth of holdings in start-ups that develop products to fight COVID. According to ""Politico"" Howard is also simultaneously advising his father-in-law Joe on COVID policy. Nothing to see here. No appearance of impropriety or conflict.  Joining me now Dinesh D'Souza conservative commentator whose new film ""Trump Card"" is available on demand and a huge smash hit. Dinesh good on ""Politico"" for drawing attention to this latest twist that Biden denies by the way. So where is the rest of the media on any of this?  DINESH D'SOUZA CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Yes the Biden family has enriched itself enormously through access to Joe Biden. Most of these people the son Hunter Biden the brothers James and Frank Biden the son- in-law they have very little qualifications themselves but their qualification is that they are related to Joe Biden. So whenever Joe Biden is the point man on anything there is money to be made. Look if the Clintons can make money off earthquakes and famines in Haiti no reason the Bidens can't make money off COVID. These people are like vultures and they circle looking for political opportunities to cash in. And it's all over the world. They have made money not just in the Ukraine.  That was the tip of the iceberg. They made money in China. Frank Biden has made money getting green contracts in Central America. They made money in Costa Rica. And they've made money getting contracts to build homes in Iraq something that none of the Bidens is even qualified to do.  So the Trumps have built things. They built Wollman Rink and Trump Tower and casinos. And the Trumps made their money that way. They're losing money in government. Trump gives away his salary. But for the Bidens politics is not just an ideology it's also a great business opportunity.  INGRAHAM:  I want to turn to Hunter Biden's longtime business partner Devon Archer. Hunter and Archer received millions of dollars from foreign nationals with questionable backgrounds according to a recent Senate Homeland Security Committee report. And last week a federal appeals court the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated Archer's conviction for defrauding a Native-American tribe out of bond sale proceeds. Hunter wasn't implicated in this but the scheme was committed under the auspices of a broader business venture in which Hunter Biden was involved and perpetrators invoked his name to bolster their legitimacy. Dinesh the Devon Archer angle why again the media no interest?  D'SOUZA:  I think it's because we have too high expectations of the media.  When we say things like the media has a double standard look at the way that they cover the Trumps with a certain kind of a fine-tooth comb even looking for things that aren't there but they cover the Bidens with this very light touch pretending that there is nothing to see there we're assuming that the media aspires at least to some standard of objectivity some sort of higher impartiality. I'm afraid that's not even the case. So we're naive in a sense in call to the media with this higher standard when they don't believe in it.  INGRAHAM:  All right Dinesh great to see you thank you so much. Still ahead Trump isn't just cured from COVID. He apparently is trained as a dancer as well. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM:  President Trump was on fire in Pennsylvania tonight and he even had time for a ""Dancing with the Stars"" moment.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (MUSIC) (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  At least he didn't do that overbite thing. I thought it was -- he was cute. He went on and on and on and on by the way. People are -- you look at the faces of people were just howling they were laughing. They were -- it was people enjoying themselves. Don't we want that again?  They're doing it in red state America already. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream who has had phenomenal analysis of the Amy Coney Barrett hearings all day long on Fox and Primetime Fox. Fantastic and the ""FOX NEWS @ NIGHT"" take it all from here. Shannon like your Friday night dance party. You got to invite Trump to that. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

301,Gingrich reacts to Pelosi's CNN 'meltdown': 'She's very fragile'," This is a rush transcript from “The Five"" October 14 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  She went on to explain that quote ""Employees must have the capacity to act collectively in order to match their employer's clout in setting terms and conditions of employment."" She urged the court to consider the quote ""extreme imbalance"" unquote of power in our nation's work spaces and avoid further undermining Congress' passage of labor laws to protect workers and place them on equal footing. Do you recognize Justice Ginsberg's point that there is quote ""extreme between imbalance of power between large corporations and individual workers?"" JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT NOMINEE TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT:  Senator Harris I'm going to give you the same answer that I gave you with respect to the sentence that you quoted me from Chief Roberts' opinion in Shelby County. That I just -- I'm not going to engage in critiquing or embracing portions of opinions especially opinions that have been recently decided and are contentious from the court. HARRIS:  And you have been on the bench a short time. But I'm going to just point out that I do believe and commentators have noted a pattern that you have of ruling against workers in favor of corporations. For example in Buloca (ph) contact transportation services you ruled against long haul truckers seeking overtime pay for additional work. (Inaudible) you ruled against delivery drivers seeking overtime pay forcing the court into private arbitration. In Harris the YRC Worldwide you ruled against four black truck drivers who alleged their employer assigned them less desirable routes when compared to their colleagues and (Inaudible) Department of Transportation. You ruled against a black worker who was called a racial slur by his supervisor. In fact if you go on according to an independent analysis (Inaudible) it appears you have sided with business interests over workers and consumers in about 85 percent of your business-related cases. Moving on climate change as many have mentioned is an existential threat and its effects are all around us. In California we've had five of the six largest wildfires in the state's history. Thirty one people have been killed by wildfires in California since August alone including at least two firefighters and a helicopter pilot. Across the state over 9000 homes and structures have been burned and Californian has been forced to breathe dangerous smoke all this obviously during a pandemic which attacks the respiratory system. But rather than work to combat climate change the Trump administration has rolled back environmental protections and removed the word -- the term climate change from government agency websites including the EPA. In 2007 in Massachusetts versus EPA the Supreme Court decided by a 5-4 ruling that states could sue the EPA for its failure to combat climate change during the Bush administration. Justice Ginsberg was the crucial fifth vote in that case. Following that ruling the EPA responded by unequivocally finding that climate change and its impacts are a danger to the public health and welfare. Justice Barrett yesterday you said that quote ""you have read things about climate change but you would not say you had firm views on it"" unquote. In response to Senator Blumenthal today you said quote ""you are not competent (Inaudible) on what causes global warning and that you don't think your views on global warming or climate change are relevant to the work you do as a judge."" I certainly do believe your views are relevant. And I'm very concerned about your statements. Since the Massachusetts v. EPA case scientific consensus has grown even more and stronger that climate change is real and it is caused by manmade greenhouse gas pollution and it poses significant threats to human life. If a case that comes before you would require you to consider scientific evidence my question is will you defer to scientists and those with expertise in the relevant issues before rendering a judgment? BARRETT:  If a case comes before me involving environmental regulation I will certainly apply all applicable law deferring when the law requires me to. And as I'm sure you know Senator Harris the Administrative Procedure Act does require courts to defer to agency fact-finding and to agency regulation when they're supported by substantial evidence. (CROSSTALK) BARRETT:  So yes I would apply that law and defer when the law requires me to defer. HARRIS:  And do you accept that COVID-19 is infectious? BARRETT:  I think yes. I do accept that COVID-19 is infectious. That that's something of which I feel like you know we could say you take judicial notice of. It's an obvious fact yes. HARRIS:  Do you accept smoking causes cancer? BARRETT:  I'm not sure where exactly you are going with this but you know the notice -- (CROSSTALK) HARRIS:  The question is what it is. BARRETT:  Senator Harris yes every package of cigarettes warns that smoking causes cancer. HARRIS:  And do you believe that climate change is happening and it's threatening the air we breathe and the water we drink? BARRETT:  Senator again I was wondering where you were going with that. You have asked me a series of questions like that are completely uncontroversial whether COVID-19 is infectious whether smoking causes cancer and then trying to analogize that soliciting an opinion on me that is a very contentious matter opinion from me that is on a very contentious matter of public debate. And I will not do that. I will not express a view on a matter of public policy especially one that is politically controversial because that's inconsistent with the judicial rule as I have explained. HARRIS:  Thank you Judge Barrett. And you made your point that you believe it is a debatable point. Mr. Chairman these proceedings I believe lack legitimacy in the eyes of the people of our country. Americans are right now suffering from a deadly pandemic and we are all suffering a historic and economic crisis. The Senate should be working day and night to provide economic relief to families and not rushing a Supreme Court confirmation. We are also in the middle of an election. More than 12 million Americans have already voted. The American people want whoever wins this election to fill this seat. My Republican colleagues know that I believe. This hearing has done nothing to alleviate the concerns raised about why this nominee was chosen and why this is being rushed when the American people deserve to be heard. So again I would say let us not pretend that we don't know what consequences rushing this confirmation will have for the American people. There are countless issues at stake. And to be candid people are very scared. They are scared that allowing President Trump to jam this confirmation through would roll back rights through generations scared about what it means to the future of voting rights about what it means for civil rights or workers rights for consumer rights for climate change and the right to a safe and legal abortion not to mention access to healthcare regardless of income or pre-existing conditions. They are also deeply concerned about what this means for our nation's continued pursuit of the timeless principle equal justice under law. And I share those concerns. My Senate Republican colleagues are doing I believe great harm with this illegitimate process. And if they are successful it has potential to do great damage. And I believe that damage is to the people of our country and to the United States Supreme Court. Thank you Mr. Chairman. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you Senator Harris. Senator Kennedy. SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA):  Thank you Mr. Chairman. Judge let's try to answer some of Senator Harris' accusations. Are you a racist? BARRETT:  I am not a racist Senator Kennedy. KENNEDY:  You're sure? BARRETT:  I'm positive. KENNEDY:  Do you support in all cases corporations overworking people? BARRETT:  I do not. And I think if you look at my record you will see cases in which I've decided in favor of plaintiffs not corporations. KENNEDY:  Are you against clean air bright water and environmental justice? BARRETT:  I am not against any of those things. Those are policies that the Congress has pursued in many statutes. And I think we all reap the benefits of when those statutes work. KENNEDY:  Do you support science? BARRETT:  I do. And I help my children with their homework when they are trying to learn it. KENNEDY:  You're sure of that? BARRETT:  I'm sure I believe in science and I support science. KENNEDY:  Do you support children and prosperity? BARRETT:  I support children seven of my own and then support others. You know obviously I think children are our future. I support children. And yes I support prosperity. KENNEDY:  Do you hate little warm puppies? BARRETT:  I do not hate little warm puppies? KENNEDY:  OK I just wanted to get all that clear. See we did that in about two minutes. BARRETT:  I think that my daughter Julia whose 10 would want me to put in a plug right now to say I do not hate chinchillas because we don't have a puppy in the Barrett house but we do have a fluffy chinchilla. And so I don't hate chinchillas either. KENNEDY:  Duly noted. Look Senator Harris is my friend. And I get it. She's running for vice president. But I want to address these voting rights allegations. Senator Harris has implied that some states are pristine and others states aren't in terms of discriminating against people on the basis of gender or race or ethnicity. We disagree. She thinks America is systemically racist. I don't. I think our entire history is the best evidence of that. I don't think we're a racist country. I think we're a country that has some racists in it. But you know I'm very proud of the fact that our country has gone from -- in 150 years which in the grand scheme of life death and the resurrection is the blink of an eye. We've gone from institutionalized slavery to an African-American president. We've passed -- I'll miss some of these dates. But we've passed civil rights laws. And I think 1869 1871 1957 1961 1965 1990 1991 I'm pretty proud of that. But let me get back to my point. My good friend Senator Harris and she is my friend I have enormous amount of respect for Kamala. She suggested that some states are wicked and other states are pristine. And I would gently remind her that California a state I love and I love visiting California. You got to keep moving because they will tax you if you stand still but I love California. But California has a deep history of discrimination against Asian-Americans. California has a deep history of discrimination against Hispanics. And I'm not saying that this is true. But there have been serious allegations made against Senator Harris that as attorney general of the wonderful state of California that she participated in racial disparities and prosecution. Let me jump subjects again. We've talked about precedent and (Inaudible) and why it is important. We need to have stability. People need to be able to rely on the law. But you're not suggesting that the United States Supreme Court never has nor should it ever reverse precedent if they think they got it wrong are you? BARRETT:  No the Supreme Court has always acknowledged that there are circumstances in which it must be able to reverse precedent. KENNEDY:  And you mentioned reliance interests. How many Americans have relied on a particular decision by United States Supreme Court as a factor in deciding whether to overturn that precedent? BARRETT:  Yes. KENNEDY:  Reliance interests are not dis-positive are they? BARRETT:  Reliance interests are not dis-positive. For example in Brown versus the Board of Education I mean clearly the south had an entire system of segregated schooling. So they relied on (Inaudible) versus Ferguson reliance was not dis-positive there because -- KENNEDY:  There were a lot of reliance interests on (Inaudible) v. Ferguson weren't there? BARRETT:  There were. I think Brown illustrates that reliance interests are not dis-positive. You have to look at all the factors (Inaudible). KENNEDY:  OK yesterday another friend Senator Booker Rhodes scholar hell of a tight end too Stanford. He asked you if you emphasize with people struggling to pay for healthcare. And of course you appropriately said yes. I mean we all do. Under our Madisonian system of separation of powers and checks and balances which branch of government is supposed to address the struggle that many Americans have to afford healthcare Congress or the United States Supreme Court? BARRETT:  Congress Senator Kennedy. KENNEDY:  Let's talk just a second about state constitutions. I know you know this. But we forget sometimes that state constitutions preceded our federal constitution am I right? And in fact there are parts of our federal constitution that were copied from state constitution. Having said that there are a lot of provisions of December (ph). For example we know we have a Fourth Amendment on the federal constitution. Many states have their own version of the Fourth Amendment. BARRETT:  Yes. KENNEDY:  What happens when a state Supreme Court construes its Fourth Amendment differently than the United States Supreme Court construes the federal Fourth Amendment? BARRETT:  So the state is free to construe its Fourth Amendment differently as a matter of state law. But of course the federal constitution also applies to the state -- to the supremacy clause. So a state isn't free to violate the Fourth Amendment. But one thing states often do which I'm sure you know because you know of your interest in state constitutions. And we talked about Louisiana constitution yesterday is that many states interpret their versions of the Fourth Amendment or other provision to be even more protective of rights than the United States constitution. KENNEDY:  So the federal constitution sets a floor? BARRETT:  But not a ceiling. KENNEDY:  So if Louisiana wants to construe its Fourth Amendment as not having any exceptions to the warrant requirement we could do that. BARRETT:  States are free. They are free to fashion their policies as they want within the limits of the federal constitution. And so contours of the federal Fourth Amendment would not themselves prohibit Louisiana from doing that. KENNEDY:  Yeah. Why does that make sense to you? BARRETT:  Well that's federalism. So my friend Judge Jeff Sutton on the sixth circuit has written a book called 51 Imperfect Solutions. And his point is that you know we have all these laboratories of democracy as they are called. The states and its federalism different states have different preferences. Their electorates can make different decisions in Louisiana than in Indiana than in California. And so if some states want to have greater protections and many do we allow those differences to flourish within the limits of the common denominator that we have which is the United States constitution. KENNEDY:  And that is just respect of the states. BARRETT:  That is. KENNEDY:  The federal constitution has a state action requirement am I right? BARRETT:  It does. KENNEDY:  OK. Would a state be free to not have a state action requirement? BARRETT:  I am not aware of any principle that would prevent a state from statute or constitutional provision. States can be the master of their own constitutions. KENNEDY:  And what do I mean when I'm talking about state action? BARRETT:  state action requirement. So the only constitutional provision I think in our constitution that applies directly to individuals is the 13th Amendment which prohibits slavery. The 14th Amendment you know which is the context in which the state action requirement has been explored in Supreme Court case law in the civil rights cases. It means that the equal protection guarantee or even all the Bill of Rights that are incorporated through it like the First Amendment only apply to the government. So when I'm teaching this to my law students what I tell them is that I can tell my kids at the dinner table. The First Amendment doesn't apply here. Hey what about my freedom of speech? And then they'll say you don't have any because in my house it is the law of Amy. So the public universities you know are different than private universities in that regard. The First Amendment applies to government-run institutions but not to private universities. KENNEDY:  Yeah. I don't know what the laws are right now. But I think there was a case. Maybe it's been overruled. But the California Supreme Court based on its constitutional history has ruled that the First Amendment in the California constitution or the First Amendment verse has no state action requirement. It doesn't protect you against government. It protects you against everybody. BARRETT:  I didn't know that. KENNEDY:  It's an interesting litigation. I read somewhere that you are an admirer of Kate Chopin? BARRETT:  Oh yeah. KENNEDY:  Who is -- tell us who she was and why you admire her. BARRETT:  Well she -- I -- when I was in college back in my English major days -- KENNEDY:  She's a Louisiana -- was a -- (CROSSTALK) BARRETT:  That is right. She wrote a book focused on Louisiana. And a woman who comes to Louisiana from -- now I can't remember what part of the south she was from and talked about her -- becoming accustomed to New Orleans and its particular culture. And I very much appreciated that because you know especially you know as a New Orleanean. I thought it was insightful look into what the history of New Orleans is like. And my family you know my great great grandparents came to New Orleans from France. And my family has been in New Orleans for generations and so its history is important to me. KENNEDY:  Ms. Chopin had a very feminist point of view too did she not? BARRETT:  She did so the awakening -- (CROSSTALK) KENNEDY:  Before her time. BARRETT:  She did. KENNEDY:  Two more. Tell me what the legal authority is if you know for a universal injunction. We have got about 600 federal judges federal district court judges. I could be off by a few. And they have -- they not only have limited jurisdiction but they have limited venue if you will. They hear cases in a certain geographical area. How can one federal district court judge in a limited venue enjoin (ph) a congressional statute or a presidential executive order for the entire United States continental and otherwise? BARRETT:  Well that is a disputed issue of law that's in litigation in the court. It's been on the court's docket the authority of district courts that issue nationwide injunction. So that would you know take me down the path of opining on a case that could wind up in litigation in front of me. KENNEDY:  OK. I got one last question. BARRETT:  Hope it's an easy one. KENNEDY:  It is. I'm -- it's a sincere question. I'm genuinely curious. Who does the laundry in your house? BARRETT:  We increasingly have been trying to get our children to take responsibility for their own. But those efforts are not always successful so we run a lot of loads of laundry. KENNEDY:  Well you're very impressive Judge. BARRETT:  Thank you Senator. KENNEDY:  I yield back Mr. Chairman. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you very much Senator Kennedy. Senator Blackburn. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN):  Thank you Mr. Chairman. DANA PERINO FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  All right. You've been watching the second day of questioning of Amy Coney Barrett the nominee that President Trump has put forward to be next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. We are going to continue monitoring that hearing. We will bring you some more. But we do want to give you a little bit of taste of what THE FIVE is thinking. We have everybody here today Kennedy Juan Jesse and Greg Gutfeld is here. You know I do want to just jump right here Greg and play a little sound from earlier from Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota. GREG GUTFELD FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Klobuchar. PERINO:  Klobuchar. If we could do maybe -- I just felt like it was pretty aggressive OK which is fine. And I think that Judge Barrett handled it well. Let's play thought number three and get Greg's thoughts overall and on this particular sound. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN):  Did you have then a general understanding that one of the president's campaign promises was to repeal the Affordable Care Act when you were nominated? BARRETT:  I -- as I said before I'm aware that the president opposes the Affordable Care Act. KLOBUCHAR:  I know you're aware now but were you aware back then? BARRETT:  Well -- (CROSSTALK) KLOBUCHAR:  -- when you were nominated. BARRETT:  Well Senator Klobuchar I think that the Republicans have kind of made that clear to the public discourse. KLOBUCHAR:  OK. Is the answer yes then? BARRETT:  Senator Klobuchar all these questions you are suggesting that I have animus or that I cut a deal with the president. That was very clear yesterday that that isn't what happened. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO:  All right Greg thoughts? GUTFELD:  Well I mean the one that I don't like about these hearings in general is that you learn about a person in how they wield their power when they have it. Like if they have this authority to treat you like crap and they do. Then they are a terrible person. But if you have the authority to hammer somebody but you do it with some kind of grace that is different. And it seems to me watching Klobuchar and watching Kamala Harris these are people that -- they just come off smaller and they come off petty. They are like mean girls and they're just jealous because this person happens to be smarter and more successful than they are. That is the impression I get when I watch this. I think so far my impression is that this is one tough cookie. And I am assuming like this to her is like a day off. Like you know she's got seven kids and like you know what I think for fun I will go stick around in the Senate hearing and let these bozos bother me. She is not above the law but she is definitely above the fray when it comes to watching her kind of like -- she is so relaxed. I didn't like the fact that when she asked about puppies she deflected to chinchillas. Answer the damn question. It is about puppies not chinchillas. But lastly I think she's got the perfect -- you guys are so silly face when she's looking while people are talking. You can just see it on her face. And that is pretty impressive. She's playing chess and they are playing KerPlunk. But my last point is as a viewer watching this. I always feel like I'm in line at TSA. And you're watching that performative theater of the TSA agents like searching forever for a little -- on a little old lady in a wheelchair. You know she's getting through. You know she's no threat. But she's going to get through. But they have to do this performative karaoke. And everybody in line has to sit and watch it. That's what this is. We know she is going to get in. She's doing a great job. They're not going to get her on anything. But yet we have to do it. Having said that I've been wrong about people not wanting to watch this because the ratings are insane and I thought that no one would be interesting. PERINO:  You think she's just so compelling that people really wanted to watch it. Can I play for you thought number six Jesse? This is the one where Senator Durbin is pressing her on whether the president has the right to delay an election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Does the constitution give the president of the United States the authority? Listen closely to what she asked you to unilaterally delay a general election under any circumstances. You didn't want to give off the cuff answers like a pundit. But rather approach matters with an open mind. BARRETT:  I've given that response to every hypothetical that I've been asked in the hearings. And I've said yesterday I do that regardless whether it is easy or hard. I don't do that to try to -- whether the question I mean would be easy or hard. I don't to try to do that to signal it. But I do that because it would be inappropriate for me to make a comment. And I don't think I've answered any legal hypotheticals in keeping with the Justice Ginsberg Rule. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO:  I mean she's just steady just a steady hitter. JESSE WATTERS FOX NEWS HOST:  She should have pulled the Ginsberg Rule when asked about puppies. I don't want to comment about puppies that might before the court. I hate to agree with Juan but I have to. He made an excellent point the other day. For last 30 years now these nominees come up. And they are not going to say anything about past cases. They're not going to say anything about future litigation. And that's what the liberal justices have done. That's what all the justices have done. So to watch these senators that don't have the sharp of an intellect try to pin this woman down who is brilliant on these cases it is almost like sport watching her deflect some of these senators the way they have. And some of these senators that we talked about who yesterday we don't want to go name names again. But you can tell the people that have lost their fastball. And you can tell others like a Durbin or a Blumenthal or Coons who are a little bit sharper with their questioning. But she's going to sail through. No one's laid a glove on her. And according to latest Monmouth poll a large portion of the country now morality want her confirmed. So if she asked I think about Obamacare do we have the Jenga sound byte Dana? PERINO:  Let me check. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS:  -- as someone that plays Jenga with my daughters this is a perfect answer for how she would handle Obamacare. If we don't have it the basic answer is the mandate may be able to come out. But it doesn't mean the entire Jenga castle falls down. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS:  That is actually kind of a conservative judicial philosophy because it's judicial restraint. You let the legislators legislate and you don't overreach. And I think a lot of people felt good about that on I think both sides of the aisle because right now it does look like ObamaCare is such a disaster that they're going to have to go back and fix it. Ted Cruz said it's raised premiums for the average family $7000. And insurance companies are getting paid hundreds and millions of dollars in subsidies. And it is ironic that some of these senators ran for president in the primary promising to eradicate ObamaCare. They want to get rid of it and they want Medicare for all and now they're begging Amy Coney Barrett to keep it there. It doesn't make a lot of sense. PERINO: Can I say something that also what you'll see is she'll get on court. Right now the Democrats really want this issue of severability not to be included right. The Jenga example was a very good one because of what you just said in terms of judicial restraint. But the Democrats want you to believe -- WATTERS: Right. PERINO: -- that the whole thing is going to fall and she was going to-- WATTERS: They want the fear. PERINO: But then after the election when she's on the court if she says that the opposite then that's what they're going to want. So they want one thing here for politics but they would rather have the opposite in reality. Kamala Harris the former -- not former excuse me -- Senator she's now running for vice president she's in the building but she didn't come to the hearing room because she was protesting Kennedy the way that the hearing was being conducted in terms of COVID protocols. But how do you think she did in this questioning today? LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY FOX NEWS HOST: I don't think that she has come up particularly well against Amy Coney Barrett. And she has the kind of background the prosecutorial background and especially as an attorney general that she should be able to use more tools at her disposal and do a better job of appealing to the base and independent voters and people who might have an issue with the timing of this nomination. And instead I think she has come off like she has during her lower points during the debate. And to Jesse's point she was one of those people who was using the ACA shtick which you can see right through you know exactly what each one of these senators are doing with you know this fallacious anecdotal evidence trying to show the worst-case scenarios from their state. She was the one who not only signed on as a co-sponsor for Medicare for all she also proposed her own socialized health care system when she was running for president that as we talked about is one of the great doings of her campaign. And she also talked about completely demolishing private health insurance. So you know he or she is appealing to save the ACA as though ACB is going to be the one to bring a sledgehammer to the law single-handedly. But at the same time she could -- she could do the same sort of professorial job of taking apart her arguments and twisting her words around in a way that Judge Barrett would have to answer and I don't think she's done that effectively. PERINO: Juan is there anything that has not come up in these hearings that you wish had? Is there something that she hasn't answered that you think would have been useful for Americans to hear? JUAN WILLIAMS FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Well I mean you know so I'm repeating myself Jesse picked up on this that I think it's both Democrats and Republican nominees basically don't answer questions. But the Democrats in this iteration have tried to say wait a second hold on there are people who have answered questions. And today in specific what you saw was they said listen in the Griswold case which has to do with contraception Chief Justice Roberts said that case was properly decided. And of course you know for people who don't know that case has lots to do with privacy rights that then extend into issues like Roe v. Wade. So she says oh you know what I can't answer that. And so what you get is senators like Blumenthal but also Cruz and others saying well wait a second other justices now sitting on the court did in fact respond to us that this case was properly decided. She wouldn't do it. And I thought that was disappointing. I wish that she would at least say yes of course that's probably decided. The only case that she says we're properly decided go back to the right of Marbury the right of the court to interpret the constitution and secondly Brown v. Board of Education with regard to school segregation and loving that extends from that. MONTGOMERY: She was -- yes in terms of super precedent. WILLIAMS: But you know to me the big point here is look we're playing a game in which we know that if you look at Justice Thomas Justice Scalia Justice Alito that every time an Obama type of legislation or law came before them they said no they're just like Red Team Blue team. No. And the Republicans are rushing this through because they know she'll be around fourth vote. And when we think about something like the Affordable Care Act we know that in fact President Trump has said he wants it undone. He has offered no replacement. And he thinks that she is going to be another vote to absolutely undo the Affordable Care Act. PERINO: Can we play a little bit of sound from that. So Greg this is her talking about the Affordable Care Act and her position. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT U.S. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: I have certainly no agenda. I'm not on a mission. I'm not hostile to the ACA at all. And if I were on the court and if a case involving the ACA came before me I would approach it with an open mind just like I do every case and go through the process that we've just discussed. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: Can you -- I mean I don't know if you can ask for more than that. GREG GUTFELD FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Also I mean I reject the idea that because you don't like something that makes you hostile to it. We are actually accepting the language and the rhetoric of the left that somehow that we've introduced this monstrosity of a social program. And we're all supposed to say yes it's here with us for life. No we know their problems with it. That doesn't make us hostile that just makes us you know human beings with brains. The bigger thing that I have about this whole process is that you have a lot of liberal left-wing women are using things like this and abortion to portray this wildly successful female is somehow a slave to patriarchy comparing her to The Handmaid's Tale dressing up like The Handmaid's Tale. She's super religious so she must be -- you know she must be subservient to men. Meanwhile they Hironi or whatever her name is I can't remember. PERINO: Hirono. GUTFELD: Accuses her if she asks her if she ever committed sexual assault right. I think it's -- PERINO: I mean it's something that Hirono asks every single nominee. GUTFELD: That's -- I get it. I understand. But if you were making the case that you know men persecute women and you have to make this case in the -- in the interest of equality to ask that woman that question the interest of equality is purely absurd. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: It's absolutely absurd. You have a family sitting there. I don't know if they were there at that time but they were there before to ask that question in the interest of ""equality"" is a farce. And so the irony of her being -- saying that she's subservient to men she's in fact being treated worse by women than by men. WILLIAMS: I don't think anybody brings up the fact that she's a woman with all these kids. I mean we have people on the court who have families and children but I think conservatives thought like saying oh she's a -- she's just a woman -- MONTGOMERY: Have you seen -- have you seen some of the stuff on Twitter from feminists? WILLIAMS: No it's not. Look -- GUTFELD: Feminists are all over. MONTGOMERY: They are directed -- no no it's directed towards her saying she cannot be a good mother when she's working full time. WILLIAMS: Well I think that's absurd. Of course I think -- I think from all indications she's a great mother. But I just don't think it's really relevant to what we're doing here which is we're confirming someone to a lifetime position on the court. PERINO: Could I play one more piece of sound. WILLIAMS: This woman says no one's above the law Kennedy. No one's above the law. So they say if you're the member of -- the Democratic member of the committee you say well OK what about President Trump pardoning himself? And then she says Well I can't speak to that because it hasn't been litigated. You think to yourself wait a second didn't you just say no one's above the law? That includes the president in our democracy. And yet she plays a game in which she said oh I can't speak to that. I mean at that point you get frustrated. PERINO: Yes I don't think that's the same. I want to play one additional piece of sound. This is (INAUDIBLE) number two because I do think that especially if you're a young woman any girls watching here tonight. Here is her talking about herself how she sees herself. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARRETT: I hope that you aren't suggesting that I don't have my own mind or that I couldn't think independently or that I would just decide like let me see what Justice Scalia has said about this in the past because I assure you I have my own mind. But everything that he said is not necessarily what I would agree with or what I would do if I were Justice Barrett. That was Justice Scalia. So I share his philosophy but I've never said that I would always reach the same outcome as he did. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: Jesse last word. WATTERS: Well it's just quite insulting for several Democrat senators to constantly saying oh well you must agree with Scalia. And like she's not an independent thinker and independent woman. I think she handled it brilliantly. And to Juan's point she's being put here because Trump won the election. And she's not there to knock down Democratic legislation. She's there to interpret the law as written in the Constitution. And that's what the Democrats are afraid of because this was mentioned. They analyzed how she ruled in Fourth Amendment issues illegal search and seizure. And she came down equally on the side of the defendant on the side of the government. She didn't try to broaden the scope of the Fourth Amendment. She didn't try to narrow it. And that's what a (INAUDIBLE) do. They interpret the law as written. And I think that should give everybody a really strong feeling about how she'll rule going forward. PERINO: All right good talk everybody. Coming up Facebook and Twitter they're blocking people from sharing a new report claiming Joe Biden met with a top executive at the Ukrainian gas company his son Hunter worked at. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MONTGOMERY: Welcome back. A major controversy over a new report about alleged e-mails involving Hunter Biden. Facebook and Twitter are blocking users from sharing a New York Post story detailing the messages that a Senate committee is now investigating. Senators are set to look into the e- mails that allegedly show Hunter Biden introduced his then vice president father to a top executive at Ukrainian gas company Burisma. The incident apparently happened in 2015 less than a year before then Vice President Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company. A Biden campaign spokesman hitting back at the report saying Joe Biden engaged in no wrongdoing adding ""we have reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting as alleged by the New York Post ever took place. Jesse that's because it wasn't in his official calendar but does every meeting informal and otherwise that happens between a politician and various emissaries and randoms from overseas do those all end up in the calendar? WATTERS: Yes if I was the vice president I would not put in my official calendar meet with my son's corrupt natural gas Ukrainian associate. I would not put that in there. But here -- his central defense was that I didn't know what my son was doing. That's obviously not true. And his son was selling access to his father. He wasn't a registered lobbyist. People have been prosecuted for that in you know around Trump's world. So the most corrupt company in Ukraine was paying the Biden family and Biden was helping the most corrupt company in Ukraine avoid prosecution. Biden says listen this was U.S. policy. So yes it was U.S. policy to protect the most corrupt company in Ukraine because this company was handing out massive no bid natural gas contracts to well-connected European and American interests. They were bribing politicians and they were putting all of these people on their board like a patronage mill. And this guy was a pro-Russian oligarch. So all Biden did was keep the gravy train running. I don't know if that's legal but it's swampy. And when Trump zeroed in on it he got impeached for it. And now Facebook doesn't want you to share the story. Again it's a rigged system. And this is in my opinion helping the president because again he is being cornered by very powerful interests whether it's big tech whether it's the media whether it's big pharma and he looks like he's fighting for the little guy because everyone in the world comes down against this president. And again I think it helps him. MONTGOMERY: At least he's fighting now because of Regeneron. So let's talk about this Juan because there are some aspects of this that are problematic that need to be vetted by journalists. They need to ask these questions. How did this laptop end up in this shop? How did Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani get hold of it? Supposedly the store owner gave it to the FBI. You were -- you were making some faces during Jesse soliloquy so where do you take issue with this story? WILLIAMS: Boy I'm glad you asked that question because I tell you you know what I've had personal experience with this as someone who's you know personal cell phone got hacked by the WikiLeaks people last time. And so I'm very sensitive to what gets reported how the press jumps on stories maybe before they're ready you know. And in this case I just think you know what it's just so important that I think we all understand very clearly that you know one no meeting ever took place not only according to Joe Biden's schedule but according to Joe Biden no meeting. OK. Number two it seems to me this story has all the hallmarks Kennedy of what I would say is disinformation political hit job put forward. MONTGOMERY: An October surprise if you will? WILLIAMS: I guess they're trying to. WATTERS: It's similar to the dossier right Juan? WILLIAMS: Well it seems to me it's much more similar to what we saw in the 2016 campaign right after the Hollywood Access tape. MONTGOMERY: So Juan what you're saying is this is fake news. WILLIAMS: Well I don't know. I don't know. I can't say that with any -- it's not as if I know that. But I will say this to pick up on your point it strains credulity that somehow Rudy Giuliani or Rudy Giuliani's lawyer is in touch with a guy in a computer store in Wilmington who gets him the computer. It just seems to me like you know what it's just beyond belief. And it's so it seems a little bit like somebody is out to smear somebody. And even if all that was said from what we know was true Joe Biden did nothing wrong. This is like another nothing -- like the unmasking story that was supposed to we were all waiting for those October surprise Bill Barr comes out yesterday and says there's nothing to the unmasking story. MONTGOMERY: OK so Greg Joe Biden has denied knowing anything about his son's business dealings. And is there any part of this that will make purchase with voters? Is there any part of the story that will harm Joe Biden if it does in fact turn out that he did meet with one of those Burisma executive? GUTFELD: Well I think when Joe Biden says he denies knowing anything people can believe that. But I do think that one of the bigger pieces to this and that Trump should probably capitalize on is the actions of Facebook and Twitter. I agree with Juan that there are parts of the story that strain belief but that never stopped Twitter or Facebook in dozens of stories about the dossier or the collusion or Jussie Smollett or sorted hoaxes that we've had to go through in videos that we were told this and it turned out that. Let's not forget Covington right? Covington was amplified by the media and they paid for it right? So I think that like the fact that Facebook and Twitter are exercising some sort of judgment because they're skeptical of this that reveals a specific bias. And I think Trump should perhaps take a close look at that and there -- and there might be something there that people can agree upon. I won't say what it is. I think that Hunter -- to Juan I don't like it when people go into people's stuff for reasons I won't get into. WILLIAMS: But we'll agree. GUTFELD: But yes we'll agree. But Hunter is making it hard for responsible libertines right. I mean he's giving partiers -- he's giving partiers a bad name. And he's that typical spoiled brat offspring of a powerful person who thinks he can get away with everything. MONTGOMERY: I'll tell you who he is. He's Jeff Spicoli. His dad is a T.V. repairman. He has the ultimate set of tools. He can fix it. But back to Twitter and Facebook are they -- are they running interference or is this the responsible duty of big social media. PERINO: I think in some ways are trying to fight the last war with new policies that haven't been tested yet in the middle of an election with a highly explosive story that might not check out but they're saying that we're -- at least on Facebook's side of saying this is going to go through a third-party fact-checker. And in the meantime I'm going to suppress it. Twitter just said we're not going to do it at all. And so I do think that if you believe that there is a faction of the Republican Party that wants to go after these tech companies you just fed them. I mean basically you just gave them their Wheaties GUTFELD: Their Wheaties. Nice. MONTGOMERY: And now everyone is going to be on the cover like a gymnast. ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: Hey it's time for ""ONE MORE THING."" Greg? GUTFELD: Now let's look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Of course they are. It's true. You know what? You look at this you can understand how good this feels. There's nothing better than a good scratch right? Right there. That's Jeff. He's a bull in New Zealand and he just likes to get his head scratched every now and then. PERINO: This is your ""ONE MORE THING?"" GUTFELD: Yes. Do you guys don't like Jeff the Bull? What is your problem Dana? Why don't you like Jeff the Bull? PERINO: I don't know. I mean I just thought there would be a little more action. GUTFELD: You're disgusting. I don't know what you mean by action. PERINO: Well -- GUTFELD: You know what we should have a talk with H.R. after the show. PERINO: And we'll call him after this. Juan. WILLIAMS: OK. So life is full of surprises. And that's especially true when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night. So take a look at this Monday night footage from a doorbell camera in California. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Paul it's Bob Wilson. You won the Nobel -- you've won a Nobel Prize. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Yes. That really happened folks. Stanford professor Robert Wilson rang Paul Milgrom's doorbell at 2:00 a.m. to tell him he won the Nobel Prize for economics. Wilson and Milgrom are both Stanford professors. They won the prize as a team. They live across the street from each other. The prestigious award comes with a $1 million cash prize and a gold medal. Now you won't be surprised to learn that Milgram's phone was unplugged because he was getting too many campaign phone calls with the election just days away. So congratulations to them. By the way the USA is winning a lot of Nobel Prizes. Go USA. MONTGOMERY: As is the Pact 12. PERINO: He's a Stanford guy. MONTGOMERY: An astrophysicist as well. PERINO: I know the Stanford guys are happy. All right I'm going to tell you about this guy. This Utah man got a little more than he bargained for. He thought he was going out on a normal hike but things got a little bit more intense. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go away. No. No. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: So that is Kyle Burgess. He was in the middle of a two-mile run on this lake canyon trail near Provo on Saturday evening and he cross paths with some wild kittens. So he started filming them on his phone and then the mama she was not happy. He realized they were mountain lion cubs. And a moment later it came out protective mother emerged and she was not having it. Thankfully he -- GUTFELD: Look at the foliage. PERINO: Yes the foliage is great. He got a big rock. He threw it towards her. She ran away. Everybody's fine. But I mean that was -- GUTFELD: That wasn't a bull. WILLIAMS: I heard it was like six minutes. PERINO: Yes six minutes. He was stopped by that. All right Jesse. WATTERS: Speaking of foliage -- PERINO: Foliage. WATTERS: That's not how you pronounce that. Hey don't do that. Hey don't do this. All right so it's leaf season. Greg knows. He lives Upstate. PERINO: Oh no you didn't do this. WATTERS: What do you do with the pile of leaves after you've raked them up? Hey don't do this. PERINO: Jesse I can't believe you're doing this story. WILLIAMS: Oh my goodness. WATTERS: You got to rake them and bag them. You don't want to light them on fire like that. PERINO: Yes. Kids don't try this at home. WILLIAMS: Wait a second. Aren't you -- aren't you having a boy -- you're having a boy child? I think that was Jesse Jr. right there. WATTERS: We're going to -- we're going to hire some landscapers. PERINO: All right Kennedy. MONTGOMERY: Well we all have been waiting for the UPS man during the lockdown especially kids who were home from school. GUTFELD: Me too. MONTGOMERY: See you get to know that person pretty well. Check out this UPS driver in Boston who got a big surprise from a family he visits almost every day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh my god. Oh my god. That is so awesome. (END VIDEO CLIP) MONTGOMERY: The entire family seven kids and a bulldog dressed up in UPS garb so they can show their appreciation to their favorite driver. They are down with brown. PERINO: Indeed they are. All right great show everybody. That's it for us. ""SPECIAL REPORT"" is up next. Hi Bret. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

302,Facebook Twitter censor New York Post report about Hunter Biden," This is a rush transcript from “Special Report"" October 14 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. BRET BAIER FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hi Dana thank you. Good evening welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight we are following two major stories. There are serious questions for Joe Biden this evening following the publication of e-mails allegedly belonging to his son Hunter that contradict or seem to the nominee's insistence the two never discussed business dealings with Ukraine. There are concerns about the authenticity and how this hard drive makes it to the FBI. But as we look into that two social media giants are hitting pause on the potential viral story until fact checkers weigh in and that's creating its own uproar. We'll look into that as well. But we begin with the confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett. She took questions today concerning whether a president could legally pardon himself and whether her involvement in the disputed election of 2000 disqualifies her to rule on a similar matter should it occur this year. But much of the inquiry had harsh political overtones. Fox News chief legal correspondent anchor of ""FOX NEWS @ NIGHT"" Shannon Bream has highlights tonight from the confirmation hearing room. Good evening Shannon. SHANNON BREAM FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good evening Bret. Well day two of questioning was marked by some technical problems and some delays but we also got a look at Professor Barrett today. She was of course fielding a question time and time again from senators today which she also spent time breaking down some complex legal issues and asking some questions of her own. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): She's going to the court. Seat at the table is waiting on you. BREAM: Republicans sounding confident but for Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett it might have felt like Groundhog Day. In day two of questioning by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee she repeatedly faced the same accusations Democrats leveled on day one that the president is fast tracking her nomination in order to see her on the Supreme Court in time to strike down the Affordable Care Act and hand him the 2020 election. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-WI): You Justice Kavanaugh and Chief Justice Roberts who worked on behalf of the Republican Party in matters related to the Bush v. Gore case do you think that that's a coincidence? JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: Are all these questions you're suggesting that I have animus or that I cut a deal with the president and I was very clear yesterday that that isn't what happened. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): The larger challenge here is not what you said about your views on cases but what the president who has nominated you has said about his goals and his objectives for your service on the court. BARRETT: I assure you I have my own mind. BREAM: And today she used it to explain the concept of severability which is the key to the Affordable Care Act case the Supreme Court will hear November 10th can the individual mandate fall and the rest of the law survive? BARRETT: A few pictures severability being like a Jenga game it's kind of if you pull one out can you pull it out while it all stands or if you pull two out will it still stand? BREAM: Barrett said today that the nomination process has been ""excruciating"" knowing that she would be mocked. BARRETT: For me to say you know I'm not willing to undertake it even though I think this is something important would be you know a little cowardly. And you know I wouldn't be answering a call to serve my country in a way that I was asked. (END VIDEOTAPE) BREAM: So twice today the hearing was shut down when the audio went out. Normally that would just be an inconvenience in this room but today it's different in the age of the pandemic because some senators wanted to Skype in or do this remotely through Zoom including Senator Kamala Harris so they had to continue. There was worry that a delay here would actually delay the entire process. This is on a tight time -- tight timeline and schedule so Republicans say they're determined to get this nominee seated before the election. All of the public questioning of her is now done. They're in a private session going over her FBI background check but they'll be back here at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow with witnesses both for and against Judge Barrett Bret. BAIER: Shannon Bream on the Hill. Shannon thanks. The election cycle tradition of an October surprise possibly being fulfilled tonight by the allegation that Joe Biden may have had a meeting he has vehemently denied. The Biden campaign still denies it tonight but e-mails allegedly from his son Hunter Biden say the meeting was at least being set up this about Hunter Biden and a powerful Ukrainian businessman. Looking into this story but we have Fox team coverage tonight Howard Kurtz tells us how social media is dealing with what many are saying censoring this story. But first senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel has the specifics. What do we know Mike? MIKE EMANUEL FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Well Bret. Good evening. An explosive story at a critical stage in this presidential campaign newly released e- mails allegedly from Joe Biden's son Hunter's computer leading to Capitol Hill investigators starting a probe. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: The Senate Homeland Security Committee is now investigating a hard drive brought forward by a whistleblower. An attorney for Rudy Giuliani tells Fox News a computer repairman came forward with a laptop and hard drive that he says belonged to Hunter Biden. He claims that it was dropped off at a shop and never picked up. Fox has told it had an estimated 40000 e-mails 1000 text messages and salacious photos and videos of the former vice president's son. Now Senate investigators are working with the whistle blower to confirm the information. He is legally blind uses a monocle to do his job and cannot confirm it was Hunter who dropped off the laptop. SHOP OWNER: I saw stuff. And I was concerned. I was concerned that somebody might want to come looking for this stuff eventually. And I wanted it out of my shop. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the stuff were images? Or the stuff were was text? E-mails? SHOP OWNER: A little bit of both. EMANUEL: Fox News has obtained in April 17th 2015 e-mail a source tells Fox it came from the computer in question is from Vadym Pozharskyi a senior official from the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma. He thanks Hunter Biden for inviting him to Washington and ""giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent some time together"" when Joe Biden was vice president. The Biden campaign says it has reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting ever took place but this has been a very sensitive subject. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think it was wrong for him to take that position knowing that it was really because that company wanted access to you? JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well that's not true. You're saying things you do not know what you're talking about. No one said that. Who said that? Who said that? EMANUEL: There's also a May 12 2014 e-mail from Pozharskyi that mentions the Hunter Biden ""We urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence to convey a message/signal etcetera to stop what we consider to be politically motivated actions. At the time Hunter Biden was reportedly being paid up to $50000 per month by Burisma while his father the vice president was the point man for the Obama administration on Ukraine. BIDEN: I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings. EMANUEL: Less than a year after that alleged 2014 meeting where Hunter evidently introduced Pozharskyi to his father a Ukrainian prosecutor was fired something Joe Biden bragged about in 2018. BIDEN: (INAUDIBLE) I said we're leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired you're not getting the money. Well son of a bitch. He got fired. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: The Trump campaign notes the Biden campaign does not dispute the authenticity of the e-mails. Fox has reached out to Pozharskyi to ask if these are his e-mails and we have not gotten a response Bret. BAIER: Mike so we know the owner turns it over to the FBI. Do we know the providence of that how it happened when it happens? EMANUEL: We understand that it's been in the FBI's possession since December 2019. It's not entirely clear how this ended up getting to an attorney with ties to Rudy Giuliani. The FBI is not talking about its possession of it. It turned us over to the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware which would not confirm or deny that an investigation was under way. We understand that there's some concern about whether the FBI had kept it whether they had fully scrub it or what and so. A guy kept a copy of it and then passed it on to Rudy Giuliani's camp and thus it is ended up in public domain at least part of it. BAIER: 20 days from an election. Mike thank you. More to this the social media reaction to the story really has been fascinating today and also highly controversial. Here's Fox News media analyst host of Fox's ""MEDIA BUZZ"" Howard Kurtz. Howie this is quite something. HOWARD KURTZ FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDIA ANALYST: It is indeed Bret. The details of today's New York Post story may be in dispute but one thing is not two social media giants don't want you to see it. After the tabloid disclosed e-mails indicating a meeting between Biden's father and that energy executive in Ukraine Facebook said it would limit the stories distribution while an outside fact checker reviewed it which is done ""If we have signals that a piece of content is false."" Now Twitter is resorting to outright censorship blocking its users from sharing the Post's piece even through direct messages. The Post saying late today the Twitter is now locked its account by arguing that the paper has violated its rules against sharing hacked material that's a quote. Now this will fuel criticism by President Trump and many others that Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter -- excuse me Twitter chief Jack Dorsey have acknowledged that their companies are accused of being biased against the right. Some top reporters who challenged the document obtained by Rudy Giuliani as Mike mentioned are taking heat from the left. New York Times' Maggie Haberman said the sketchy story left unclear when Giuliani obtained the document. Politico's Jake Sherman added yes and how did Rudy get it? Liberal Times columnist Michelle Goldberg responded you're really going to help Giuliani and Steve Bannon wonder this bull through the news cycle. Senator Ted Cruz today accused Twitter of an obvious and transparent attempt to influence the election and of hypocrisy for allowing shoddy or stories about other politicians. A top producer for MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell tweeted no one should link to or share the New York Post report but such efforts may be backfiring bringing even more attention to this story Bret. BAIER: OK Howie thank you. Now the reaction from the Biden campaign. Correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest tonight from Wilmington Delaware. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER DOOCY FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Joe Biden brought a story about his son Hunter on the campaign trail this week. BIDEN: The reason I went home is the same reason why all you do or try to and that is that to be there in the evening when my kids went to bed. In the morning my son Beau my son Hunter and my daughter Ashley. DOOCY: He defended Hunter on the debate stage. BIDEN: My son like a lot of people like a lot of people you know at home had a drug problem. He's overtaken it he's fixed it he's worked on it and I'm proud of him. DOOCY: And now his campaign claims they can't find any evidence to support reporting that Hunter introduced his dad then vice president to a Ukrainian business partner. ""We've reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting as alleged by the New York Post ever took place."" The campaign also insists previous investigations about wrongdoing cleared Biden whose focus at a fundraiser today was on a phone call telling donors ""Just got off the phone with Warren Buffett and talking about how we're in a position unlike we were 50 70 80 years ago to lead the whole damn world in a way that no one else can."" For months Biden has favored virtual or small socially distanced events while calling out large Trump rallies. BIDEN: So reckless. DOOCY: COVID-19 cases have been linked to multiple Trump vents and now a Biden event as well. At least one COVID-19 case has reportedly been traced to a stop Biden made at the end of last month in Minnesota. BIDEN: Hello Minnesota it's good to be back. DOOCY: As Biden's running mate Kamala Harris attends Supreme Court confirmation hearings Biden says Amy Coney Barrett shouldn't be confirmed but that she ""Seems like a decent person."" And despite Biden's big lead over Trump in the polls. BIDEN: Well you know I'm one of those superstitious guys it isn't over till it's over. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: It's a day closer to being over but Biden is not in a battleground state instead he's here at home in Delaware. He is going to deliver pre- taped remarks to a Muslims Making Change event this evening and of course he did attend that virtual fundraiser with 37 donors Bret. BAIER: Peter Doocy in Wilmington. Peter thanks. President Trump is once again spending the dinner hour on the road tonight making campaign stop in Des Moines Iowa. He's scheduled to be -- to speak as to as many as 10000 people at the top of the hour. The Hunter Biden story I'm sure would come up. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts joins us now. Good evening John. We can bet that that's probably going to be in the repertoire tonight. JOHN ROBERTS FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: I would think so. You know Bret you and I both been aboard Air Force One and we both know that they serve good food aboard that aircraft so it's not the worst place to spend yet another dinner hour. But the president keeping up an intensive schedule in these last three weeks of the campaign and he's got something new to chew over with voters tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: As the president left for a rally in Iowa tonight his campaign and White House officials pumping up reports in the New York Post about Hunter Biden's e-mails that suggest Hunter introduced his father Joe Biden to Ukrainian energy executive and colleague on the board of Burisma. ALYSSA FARAH WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Well listen Vice President Biden's got some serious questions to answer and I hope that the media will actually press him on this. ROBERTS: This afternoon the report was partially censored by Facebook and Twitter. Missouri Senator Josh Hawley a member of the Homeland Security Committee tweeting ""This is amazing. Now Twitter joins Facebook in censoring the New York Post reporting on Biden. You almost get the idea big tech wants to buy this election."" The president expected to talk more about it in Iowa though making attacks on Hunter Biden stick to his father Joe has proven difficult. President Trump is also expected to praise his pick for the Supreme Court tonight. The president very happy with what he has seen so far in confirmation hearings. DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And Amy is doing a fantastic job. Amy I think is doing an incredible job. ROBERTS: President Trump hoping a swift confirmation will energize his base to come out and vote. The RealClearPolitics polling average showing the race neck and neck in Iowa a state the president won by nearly 10 points in 2016. In Johnstown Pennsylvania last night President Trump looking to turn around his fortunes with suburban women appealing to them with his message of law and order. TRUMP: I ask you to do me a favor. Suburban women will you please like me? Remember? Please please. I saved your damn neighborhood OK? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald J. Trump. ROBERTS: The president today focusing on getting America back to work speaking to a group of economic clubs insisting that despite trials of two coronavirus vaccines temporarily being put on hold the nation is still on track for mass inoculation. TRUMP: We're on track to deliver at least 100 million doses of a vaccine before the end of the year with hundreds of millions more to quickly follow. ROBERTS: The president warning of a dramatic decline in economic growth if he is defeated in November. TRUMP: The choice facing America is simple. It's the choice between historic prosperity under my pro-American policies or very crippling poverty and a steep depression under the radical left and that's what you'll have it's a depression. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: Polls continue to show that voters trust President Trump more than they do Joe Biden to handle the economy. The president is going to need that trust if he hopes to win reelection. In an interview that will air very soon on CBS News Dr. Anthony Fauci saying it will likely not be until April that a coronavirus vaccine is widely available. So that means that the economy will probably not go into a full recovery until some months from now. And Bret just going through the experts of the president's speech that he will give in Des Moines nothing specific about Hunter Biden in the excerpts though expect the president probably will go there tonight. BAIER: John Roberts live on the North Lawn. John thanks. First Lady Melania Trump says her 14-year-old son Barron has tested positive for coronavirus but has no symptoms. Officials initially said he had tested negative after both of his parents tested positive earlier this month. The first lady says subsequent testing showed Barron has also come down with COVID-19. She says her latest test came back negative. Late today President Trump was asked about all of this he said his son Barron is just fine. Up next a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee on today's hearings and the other big news of the day. First here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 2 in Saint Louis as the husband-and-wife charged with felonies for waving guns at protesters marching on their private street plead not guilty. Mark and Patricia McCloskey were indicted by a grand jury last week on charges of unlawful use of a weapon and tampering with evidence. Fox 29 in Philadelphia city officials reach an agreement to close a homeless encampment that has occupied the Benjamin Franklin Parkway since June 10th. An estimated 150 people have agreed to leave their tents by the end of the week. And this is a live look at San Francisco from our affiliate out there Fox 2 the big story there tonight. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric warns more than 54000 customers in 24 countries that they may lose their electricity starting tonight -- that means counties. The nation's largest utility is expected to make a decision on whether to implement preemptive electricity cuts to prevent fires during extremely high fire conditions featuring heat bone-dry humidity and high winds. That's tonight's live look ""OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY"" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Joining us now to talk about today's big stories a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee interviewing Judge Amy Coney Barrett today and yesterday John Kennedy Republican Senator from Louisiana. Senator thanks for being here. SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): You bet Bret. BAIER: First I want to ask you about the judge how you think it has gone how she has kind of survived some of the tough questions on the Democratic side and where you think this is right now? KENNEDY: Well after about 20 hours of testimony I think any fair-minded person would have to conclude that Judge Barrett is eminently qualified. She is a very impressive intellect. She has integrity she has a wonderful judicial temperament and she has a very studied disciplined judicial philosophy. Now I happen to agree with it. But even if you don't agree with her judicial philosophy it's not some frivolous belief she spent a lot of time thinking and writing about it and she'll be a great addition to United States Supreme Court. BAIER: This is the vice presidential nominee Senator Kamala Harris talking about this process. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Sadly my Senate Republican colleagues are doing I believe great harm with this illegitimate process. And if they are successful it has the potential to do great damage. And I believe that damages to the people of our country and to the United States Supreme Court. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: You know I asked Senator Tillis this last night. I think everyone believes that if Democrats were in the same position that they would move forward to fill the vacancies. But what would Republicans do in this same position on the side the Democrats are now if it was a President Obama filling the seat 20 days before an election? KENNEDY: Well if you -- if you look at the history here is what I think it shows. When the Democrats are in control and by that I mean they have control of the presidency and the Senate. And there's a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court they feel the vacancy. They do what they think is right and that means to them filling the vacancy. I think you can say the same thing about the Republicans. I think that's what our founders intended. The provisions of the constitution about vacancies on the United States Supreme Court are unaffected by the electoral Cabinet. When there's a vacancy if the president chooses to fill it and nominate someone then the Senate advises and consents. And that's all we're doing. We're following the Constitution. BAIER: All right Senator I want to ask you about this other story that's breaking. The New York Post I'm sure you've read it about these e-mails allegedly from Hunter Biden's computer that talk about a meeting with Joe Biden and what the company expects Hunter Biden to do for it. There's other stuff on that computer as well. We can't get to the providence of how it gets to the FBI and how it gets to Rudy Giuliani through an attorney we're trying to dig into this and a lot to learn. But Twitter and Facebook have prevented people from linking to it. I want to get your take on the story and about the social media reaction to it. KENNEDY: Three points Bret. Number one these accusations are as serious as four heart attacks and a stroke. Now we're talking about a major party nominee to -- for president of the United States of America with an election right around the corner. And every single solitary responsible news organization needs to be investigating the veracity of these allegations and these e-mails. Number two the New York Post is a responsible reputable news organization. It is subject to the libel laws and the defamation laws of our country. If social media is playing favorites here and trying to pick winners and losers and discriminating against the New York Post because it doesn't like the article that is wrong. If that's what's going on. Number three while we're trying to figure this out here's what we do know and it's important. President Obama put Vice President Biden in charge of the America's foreign affairs with two countries: Ukraine and China. And in both cases his son Mr. Hunter Biden walked away with millions of dollars of contracts. I'm not accusing anybody of anything. But I'm telling you this this is the message it sent to the rest of the world. The foreign policy of the United States of America can be bought like a sack of potatoes. And that's a disservice to America and to the world. BAIER: Were this close to an election we're trying to get to the authenticity of these e-mails the Biden campaign said the meeting didn't happen by their calendar. They haven't pushed back on the authenticity of the computer. But do you have problems Senator that the Treasury Department called the man that was meeting with Rudy Giuliani an active Russian agent for more than a decade? Do you -- do you have problems with the story 20 days from an election as we are looking into the authenticity of all of this? KENNEDY: Well here I think many people have questions right now Bret. We want to get this right. It's important that we get this right. But there's an answer. Every responsible news organization in America and frankly the world needs to be investigating the veracity of these accusations and those e-mails. This is important and we need to get this right. And that's why we have the First Amendment. And while we have a free and fair -- supposedly fair media. BAIER: Senator Kennedy we appreciate your time. We promise you we're in the process of digging as well. KENNEDY: Thank you Bret. BAIER: Thanks. Up next the dispute over whether President Trump has ordered the Justice Department to release its findings on what he calls the Russia hoax. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER:  The Trump administration is welcoming the release of two U.S. citizens from Iran backed Houthi fighters in Yemen. First reported by ""The Wall Street Journal"" Sandra Loli and Mikael Gidada were freed in exchange for the return of more than 200 militants in Yemen the remains of another American also being repatriated. If President Trump wins reelection he might be in the market for a new attorney general. That is the word on the street. Correspondent David Spunt is with us tonight from the Justice Department. Good evening David. What are they saying about that? DAVID SPUNT FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Bret good evening. Quite a story a senior administration official tells FOX News they are defending Attorney General Bill Barr after President Trump criticized him in an interview airing on ""Newsmax"" this evening. The president said reportedly he is quote ""not happy"" and he has no comment when asked if he would keep Attorney General Bill Barr for a second term. I want to read this statement from this administration official to FOX News. It says quote ""The great irony in the president's remarks is he is only a position to complain because Bill Barr saved his presidency and everyone knows it."" The president upset with the Justice Department in recent weeks put out a tweet last week quote ""I have fully authorized the total declassification of any and all documents pertaining to the single greatest political crime in American history the Russia Hoax. Likewise the Hillary Clinton email scandal. No reductions!"" But this week attorneys with the Justice Department in a court filing said hold on the declassification of information were not in order to the Department of Justice to declassify materials in this case. I'm told they will declassify on an as-need basis. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo he says he is on a mission to declassify and release some emails from his predecessor former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. And Bret he says this is not political. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE POMPEO SECRETARY OF STATE:  We'll continue to do the right thing. We'll make sure that all these emails get to the right place and we will do everything we can to make sure that the American people get a chance to see as much as we can equitably produce. (END VIDEO CLIP) SPUNT:  Bret Secretary of State Pompeo says that he is not on any timetable to release any emails but he will do so until he is no longer secretary of state. Bret? BAIER:  Within 20 days we think. We also understand the Department of Justice may have come up dry in this investigation into unmasking? SPUNT:  Yes ""The Washington Post"" Bret reporting that this unmasking investigation is not yielding any charges and there will be no report. This is something President Trump has talked about extensively. We first reported on this unmasking back in May. We reported that several Obama era officials at top levels requested to reveal the name or unmask someone in a report that turned out to be former national security advisor Michael Flynn. Attorney General Bill Barr farmed out the investigation into the U.S. attorney in west Texas John Bash. Bash left the Department of Justice last week. The DOJ is declining to comment on that investigation. And Bret more news from the Department of Justice tonight. Just a few hours ago the Senate intelligence committee released some transcripts of FBI interviews with former DOJ employee Bruce Ohr. He was involved as what was called the back channel for the Steele dossier. We are told that in those notes Ohr let people know at DOJ the FBI and the Hillary Clinton campaign some of the contents of that Steele dossier. And we also found out that Bruce Ohr left the department. He quit two weeks ago. Bret? BAIER:  It's like drinking from a fire hose here David. But we don't think that there's any summary or anything from John Durham coming out in the next 20 days? SPUNT:  At this point we have heard for a year-and-a-half almost a year- and-a-half that this John Durham investigation would be wrapping up. I was told by a source it would be wrapping up by the end of summer. I said when is that going to be. They said summer ends September 21st. There was not report there. The latest we are getting from several sources over here at the Justice Department it does not appear that this is going to come before the election. After all as you said the election just three weeks away. Of course things could always change but at this point it doesn't look like it. Bret? BAIER:  OK David Spunt at the Department of Justice. David thank you. Up next the latest on coronavirus relief negotiations on Capitol Hill. First beyond our borders tonight. As talks between Great Britain and the European Union over a post Brexit trade agreement remain unsettled an EU summit begins Thursday. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that date as a deadline for a deal. And the first of its kind clergy sex abuse trial begins in the Vatican's Criminal Tribunal. A priest accused of molesting an altar boy another priest accused of covering it up. The scandal is considered particularly grave because the abuse allegedly occurred within Vatican City itself. Just some of the stories beyond our borders tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER:  The Dow lost 166 today the S&amp;P 500 was off 23 the Nasdaq dropped 95. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she had a productive discussion with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about a new coronavirus relief package. Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram live on Capitol Hill with what that means. What is productive? Chad good evening. CHAD PERGRAM FOX NEWS PRODUCER:  Hey there Bret good evening. Well it probably is in the eye of the beholder on that front here. There are a lot of Democrats who are pressuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to get some sort of deal and she is being defensive about it. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WOLF BLITZER CNN ANCHOR:  Even members of your own caucus Madam Speaker want to accept this deal $1.8 trillion. Congress Ro Khanna for example -- REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA) HOUSE SPEAKER:  I don't know why you're always an apologist and many of your colleagues apologists for the Republican position. Ro Khanna that's nice. That isn't what we are going to do and nobody is waiting until February. I want this very much now because people need help now. PERGRAM:  Pelosi and Mnuchin talked again today for an hour they will speak again tomorrow. They've been talking almost daily since mid- September but chasms remain. STEVEN MNUCHIN TREASURY SECRETARY:  Getting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult just given where we are in the level of details but we are going to continue to work through these issues. PERGRAM:  President Trump this week implored lawmakers to quote go big or go home on a coronavirus bill. Now that was a 180 for the president. He had canceled coronavirus negotiations. He urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to focus only on confirming Amy Coney Barrett. But then McConnell announced the Senate would consider a thin $500 billion coronavirus bill next week. Democrats are confused. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL) SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  It would sure be great if the president and Senator McConnell were speaking to one another and had a common approach. What I hear from Senator McConnell is once again take a little piece and be satisfied. And what I hear from the president is just the opposite. Can the two of them sit down and agree wouldn't that be a breakthrough? (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM:  Pelosi is reluctant to deal. The reason -- she only wants to go through this process once. Going through it twice is a lot harder. Bret? BAIER:  OK we'll follow it. Chad thank you. Up next the panel rejoins me -- joins me for the first time to look at day three of the Barrett confirmation hearings and also this breaking news about that ""New York Post"" story. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER:  You're looking live Des Moines Iowa Air Force One getting ready to land there. The president will hold an event in which we are just hearing that he will change his speech about adding this Hunter Biden story that's in ""The New York Post."" Among other things about Joe Biden the president will say quote ""He lied to you over and over and over because he is trying to cover up a massive pay for play scandal at the heart of his vice presidency."" This is about a ""New York Post"" story you can see the cover of the story about emails that they say they recovered from a computer a man who had a computer shop who he says Hunter Biden comes into the shop with the computer leaves it. It is a long sordid and frankly sketchy tale about how this all comes to be. Here is the owner of that computer shop talking about how it gets to the FBI. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAVANNAH GUTHRIE JOURNALIST:  Do you think it was wrong for him to take that position knowing that it was because that company wanted access to you? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why did you flag the FBI? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Fear a lot of fear. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And then again ""The New York Post"" said that you then later handed over the copy to the Giuliani attorney. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If that's what it says. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Any thought Giuliani could provide some type of publicity or cover for you? Or -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have no comment. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER:  OK the first sound bite you heard was Savannah Guthrie. We'll get to that in a bit with Joe Biden. We are here with our panel Charlie Hurt Marc Thiessen A.B. Stoddard. OK where are we on this? We are trying to figure out the authenticity of this story we are trying to figure out the authenticity of the emails. The Biden campaign put out a statement saying that the meeting between this Burisma official and Vice President Biden never happened according to their calendar. They didn't get into the authenticity of the emails. Charlie what do you think about this 20 days from an election? CHARLES HURT OPINION EDITOR ""WASHINGTON TIMES"":  Well I guess it's maybe another example of 2020. It is definitely strange. And yes there are parts of this story that seem a little bit sketchy but not nearly as sketchy as the idea that the son of the vice president would get $50000 a month from a Ukrainian gas company and not do something for them on their behalf using his connections to the White House. There are lots and lots of questions that need to be answered here but the only wrong answer to this is to not try to get to the bottom of it. And the idea that you have social media companies wanting to censor this stuff not only is it completely idiotic and a violation of everything that we believe in about free speech and open debate robust debate in an election I also think it won't work because you're not holding back interesting curious information like this by squelching certain Twitter or Facebook users. BAIER:  Here's what Senator Kennedy said about all of that just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA):  These accusations are as serious as four heart attacks and stroke. Every responsible news organization in America and frankly the world needs to be investigating the veracity of these accusations and those emails. This is important and we need to get this right. And that's why we have the First Amendment and why we have a free and fair supposedly fair media. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER:  A.B. your thoughts on this? We're in a world where obviously Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election. The Treasury Department as I mentioned to Senator Kennedy identified someone that was interacting with Rudy Giuliani who was a Russian agent for years. There is a sensitivity to it but yet it could be authentic. We are looking into it. A.B. STODDARD ASSOCIATE EDITOR REAL CLEAR POLITICS:  Right. Well there were a lot of warnings given by our own government to Rudy Giuliani as well as Senator Ron Johnson who has been investigating Burisma and Hunter Biden about their sources and about the fact that they are dealing with people who are conduits for Russian disinformation in that current campaign against Joe Biden in the 2020 election. That aside if this were to be true it is not a pay-to-play scandal and it is not a heart attacks and stroke and a big pile like Senator Kennedy described because ""The New York Post"" got it wrong about Vice President Biden. He was behind an international coalition to get rid of a prosecutor general who was not investigating corruption in Ukraine in many companies including Burisma. Had that happened it would have been a problem for Burisma and therefore Hunter Biden. Part of the group supporting that coalition included Republicans like Senator Ron Johnson and it's documented from 2016 that he was behind it. ""The New York Post"" reported that incorrectly in the piece. What you played that clip from Savannah Guthrie what this arrangement was about was absolute influence peddling nepotism that is completely legal and that our government permits. BAIER:  Let me just play that soundbite. I think we can recue that the Savannah Guthrie soundbite and then we'll hear the Joe Biden stuff and then I will show this email that again we are trying to get to the authenticity of it. Take a listen to Savannah Guthrie's interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAVANNAH GUTHRIE JOURNALIST:  Do you think it was wrong for him to take that position knowing that it was really because that company wanted access to you? JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  That's not true. You're saying things you do not know what you're talking about. No one said that. Who said that? (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER:  All right so in one of these emails Hunter and Vadym Pozharskyi says ""We urgently need your advice on how you could use her influence to convey a message a signal to stop what we consider politically motivated actions."" Again the company trying to use Hunter Biden. STODDARD:  That's likely why he was paid a bunch of money every month but it is important to remember that all of this although it is incredibly wrong is legal. Jared Kushner and Ivanka made $350 million --  BAIER:  Marc let me get you to weigh in. STODDARD: -- in this administration while working inside the White House on staff. MARC THIESSEN AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  Here's the problem with A.B.'s analysis which is this does touch on Joe Biden because Joe Biden was told by Amos Hochstein by his own son that he was working for Burisma. He knew that his son was making money off of his name. And we just heard during the Coney Barrett hearings all the Senate Democrats say you have to recuse yourself on Obamacare and you have to recuse yourself in the election because of an appearance of a conflict of interest. What about Joe Biden? He had at least the appearance of a conflict of interest because his son was making millions of dollars from Burisma that was fighting this prosecutor. So even if he did nothing wrong he had the appearance of a conflict of interest and Democrats are complete hypocrites on this. BAIER:  The time is running out Marc but the headline from your interview with President Trump. THIESSEN:  It is a fascinating interview a side of President Trump you don't see. And the really most interesting part is he talked about something I'm never see him talk about how he plans to unite the country if he wins reelection because there's 56 percent of the country says they are better off now than they were four years ago which is during a pandemic. He thinks that if he can win reelection the Democrats are going to come around to start working with him and he talks about how he can do that. BAIER:  All right panel sorry we ran out of time. Thank you. When we come back something to agree about at the Amy Coney Barrett hearings.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER:  I'm was going to play a soundbite from Judge Barrett saying she needed to a glass --  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC.

303,Trump campaign presses for Hunter Biden probe ahead of Iowa rally," This is a rush transcript from “The Story with Martha MacCallum "" October 14 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We do have a busy night for you folks. Good evening everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York and this is THE STORY. As we sit 20 days before this presidential election of 2020 President Trump has been crossing the country this week. In moments he will touch down in Iowa. And we are told by our own reporter John Roberts that the president on the plane has been reworking a huge chunk of his speech tonight. He will be as you might expect focusing on this news story a bombshell report published by The New York Post reported by them earlier today. So that report reveals alleged emails between Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden and a Ukrainian businessman that discussed a meeting with the former vice president. The Biden campaign pushing back on this report tonight. Otherwise though they were not on the campaign trail throughout the course of today. We're going to have much more on this story including the president's speech as soon as he takes the stage there in Des Moines Iowa tonight so we can hear his response. It'll be the first time he's really reacting to any of this. So stay tuned for that newsworthy event in just a little while. So tomorrow both Joe Biden and the president will have town halls on the night that was supposed to be the second presidential debate. So that leaves just one more matchup between these two individuals and that will be next week in Nashville Tennessee. So let's swing our attention for a moment here back to Capitol Hill today. Judge Amy Coney Barrett now done with the question and answer two very long days throughout which she was very composed and answered those questions in a very solid manner. I think both sides would say over the course of this process we're going to kick off with an observation that was made at the beginning of today by the chairman of the committee Senator Lindsey Graham. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): This hearing to me is an opportunity to not punch through a glass ceiling but a reinforced concrete barrier around conservative women you're going to shatter that barrier. And this is history being made folks. This is the first time in American history that we've nominated a woman who is unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology. And she's going to the court. Seat at the table is waiting on you. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Lindsey Graham says she is going to the court. The vote has not happened yet as you know and is expected to wrap up at the end of the month. So the talk will shift to how the court will change in this new composition. Barrett's approval rating did tick higher as Americans watched her over the course of the last two days. Senator Durbin bookended Lindsey Graham's comments about making history but his take on how that history was being made went this way. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): You're making history. You were the first nominee for a vacancy on the Supreme Court to be considered after July 1st of the election year. In fact you're the first nominee to ever be considered in the midst of an election. There is a political agenda here. And whether you are privy to it part of it notwithstanding it has to do with the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately that is the cloud. The orange cloud over your nomination (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: That from Senator Durbin. Joining me now is Chairman Chuck Grassley. He sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee. And of course he was the chair of that committee during previous nominations for Kavanaugh and Gorsuch now justices and he joins us now. Senator Grassley thank you. It's always good to have you with us on the program. SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA): Thank you. MACCALLUM: I'd like to start if I may because we saw Senator Durbin suggesting that she might be privy to some plan to change the Obamacare ACA as it is known. And here she is expressing her complete independence as a judge. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMY CONEY BARRETT SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: I hope that you aren't suggesting that I don't have my own mind or that I couldn't think independently or that I would just decide like let me see what Justice Scalia has said about this in the past because I assure you I have my own mind. But everything that he said is not necessarily what I would agree with or what I would do if I were Justice Barrett. That was Justice Scalia. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So I think the Justice Kavanaugh hearings a scarred a lot of people's memories. And you were right in the center of that it was really raucous from the very beginning. Everybody remembers Kamala Harris jumped in I think within seconds of you gaveling down to start opposing even the proceedings going forward. How do you feel about how this process has reflected on the Senate Judiciary Committee Senator? GRASSLEY: Well for everybody on the committee the fact that it was more peaceful than Kavanaugh I think it's going to really satisfy people from that standpoint. I think from the standpoint of people not being able to find particularly Democrats on the committee not being able to find any fault wrong with her qualifications because they're impeccable. They tried to make a pretty much a political campaign out of this reflecting things that they think will help them between now and November the 3rd. But overall I think that this is much better a public image of this committee in this process than Kavanaugh was. And without a doubt the difference between night and day. MACCALLUM: So as we all remember when you look back at the beginning of the Kavanaugh process was very smooth and the overall impression was that he was going to be approved without any major speed bumps. And the speed bumps came after the part that we all just finished in this process. Do you have any indication because the vote isn't until the end of the month that Democrats are sitting on any information that they have anything up their sleeve? Or do you think it goes smoothly this time all the way through? GRASSLEY: The only - I can't really answer your question except referring back to what Senator Schumer said over the weekend that they might not even show up to make a quorum on the day that we vote on this. And if he would go through with that then things would be different. But you're absolutely right. Everything up until about the first week of September on Kavanaugh was very peaceful. And then just soon as they couldn't get - lay a hand on him they came up with all the things with Dr. Ford et cetera et cetera. And we haven't seen any of that this time but we aren't going to know until tomorrow. MACCALLUM: Do you anticipate that politically they would assess that not producing enough senators for the quorum and the full Senate vote would be advantageous to them? GRASSLEY: I think everybody goes to work for their job. We get paid about $175000 a year. They expect us to work. I have - I've got the best record of any senator in the 240 years history of our country of not missing a vote. I'm going to be there. I think every senator should be there. I think the taxpayers expect and be there. But for reasons that they might think that they would at least satisfy their very progressive base which if you look at their Twitter some of that progressive base isn't very happy with the way Feinstein and other people in the Senate handled this. In other words they weren't tough enough. You don't know what they might do to satisfy their progressive base. MACCALLUM: In fact Dianne Feinstein really complimented her on her explanation of severability. She said wow that was pretty great. It was a very honest I think answer in the moment. This is Kamala Harris who was I believe just down the hall in her office. You know and after I play this I'd like to hear about why you believe she was there instead on the floor which was basically empty by that point. Here she is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I just want to understand are you saying that you refuse to dispute a known fact or that you refuse to agree with a known fact? BARRETT: Senator I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at with asking me to endorse the fact or whether any particular practice constitutes voter discrimination. I'm very happy to say that I think racial discrimination still exists in the United States and I think we've seen evidence of that this summer. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: What was your thought on that exchange sir? GRASSLEY: Well first of all I think she would look better if she had been in the committee room with us. Secondly the reason she wasn't there I'm told is because of protection from the virus which is legitimate. But I also heard that some people are getting in the elevator with a massive number of people. So I don't know whether the distancing was a very important factor. There was some other reason she wasn't there. MACCALLUM: Interesting. All right. Speaking of Twitter this story that came out The New York Post reported that they got their hands-on emails between Hunter Biden and a Ukrainian businessman that don't look very good. The first one that came out was from April 17th 2015 and it says Dear Hunter and this is from Vadim Pozharskyi an adviser to Verismo. He says Dear Hunter thank you for inviting me to D.C. and giving me an opportunity to meet your father and spend some time together. It's really an honor and a pleasure. And then a previous email that sets this up is back in May of 2014 asking Hunter for advice on how you could use your influence on our company's behalf. Now Twitter restricted this story. They shut down the story in some way shape or form. And even people's accounts who were tweeting this story got a block on them. And now Senate Republicans have put out a response to Jack Dorsey of Twitter. And there's a look at that showing the block of this story on Twitter and saying see you soon Jack referring to the chairman and founder of Twitter. What do you think about all that sir? GRASSLEY: Well this this censorship by these platforms is a bigger thing but this is a perfect example of where there's some evidence of things that I and my investigation and Johnson's investigation has been suspicious of for a long time and it kind of backs up our suspicion. All I personally know about it is what I read in the post but it does give some credence to things we believe for a long time like we know for instance money from the mayor's wife of Moscow paying some millions of dollars to some firm connected with Hunter Biden. I don't want to say for sure that we've got absolute proof that this is going on but it sure goes down the same direction that we had been suspicious of for a long period of time. Well I have not received this material. Senator Johnson has received it. And I'm going to wait until Senator Johnson gets some review of it. MACCALLUM: All right. Fair enough. We will speak I believe we're going to speak to Rudy Giuliani tomorrow about this and we will be speaking with him tomorrow night. And we'll reach out to Senator Johnson as well to get the facts. And we do hope that there will be questions asked about it obviously at this town hall tomorrow night would be the first opportunity to ask the former vice president about it. So Senator Grassley thank you very much sir. Always good to see you. GRASSLEY: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Thanks for being here. GRASSLEY: Thank you. MACCALLUM: So we do expect President Trump is going to take the stage a big crowd in Des Moines Iowa this evening. We're told that he has reworked a large portion of his speech tonight and he's going to focus it on this New York Post story which is now also become a story about Facebook and Twitter who don't want you to see this story because they say that it's not substantiated. So that back and forth is also a big part of this. We will take you there when that gets underway. And also one of the biggest unanswered questions raised by this New York Post story is the man who turned over these emails which were on a laptop. Where did he get them? That man speaks out to our own reporter at Fox News after this. Stay with us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who specifically are we talking about when you say you're fearful? JOHN PAUL MAC ISAAC OWNER OF COMPUTER REPAIR SHOP: I mean you read the article there is compromising material on the drive. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So the Biden's? You're afraid of? ISAAC: That's that's the fear. Sure. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So The New York Post dropped a bombshell report today. The reporting lays out purported emails between Hunter Biden and Ukrainian businessmen. In the emails they're discussing with then a meeting with the then Vice President Joe Biden and how Hunter could use his influence in those business dealings. Now the Post reports that the emails came from a laptop that was dropped off at a computer repair shop in Delaware back in April of 2019. And now the focus has turned to the owner of that shop and his connection to Rudy Giuliani who ended up with one of the hard drives. So correspondent Jacqui Heinrich spoke with the owner of this computer shop today and she joins us with that report from Wilmington. Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening Martha. Well the owner of this shop is legally blind. He uses a monocle to repair computers from a working distance of about eight inches. So he cannot confirm that it was Hunter Biden who in fact dropped off the laptop here he says back in April. But he says while he was in the process of transferring data from that computer he found some disturbing items including pornography. By June and July impeachment was in the headlines. And after 90 days passed and Hunter Biden still had not paid for or picked up his laptop. The owner John Paul Isaac who is a registered Republican keywords searched through the emails and found what appeared to be an email from Burisma board member asking Hunter Biden for advice on how he could use his influence on the company's behalf. Another purported email asks Hunter to set up a meeting with Vice President Biden. Isaac said with the impeachment ongoing he used an intermediary to inform the FBI who took the computer. He says he saw no substantial follow- up. So the intermediary reached out to three lawmakers who he says also did nothing. Later they went to politicians including Rudy Giuliani's lawyer. He says this intermediary is an American citizen and a longtime friend. And in light of Burisma being hacked by the Russians and concerns those emails could have been planted Isaac said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there any thought in your mind that this could not - that this might not have been Hunter's that might have been somebody trying to set Hunter up? ISAAC: No. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEINRICH: Isaac believes the FBI covered up the investigation claiming at one point they said nothing happens to people who don't talk. He was frustrated by the impeachment over President Trump's alleged efforts to discover such information as he had in his shop and said he was in fear of his life. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ISAAC: There's a lot of players in this. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Ukrainians? Is that who you're talking about? ISAAC: I mean don't put that in there. The guy's got a hit squad. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's who you're afraid of you're afraid of the Ukrainians? ISAAC: I'm afraid of somebody wanting to not make sure that I don't extort them for money or that I don't do you know things with the computer. They would silence people too. So I was afraid for the owner. I was afraid for the people that are involved the contents of it. And I just wanted it out of my shop. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So you're afraid for Hunter Biden? Not of the Biden family. ISAAC: No. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEINRICH: And the owner clearly stated that he took action because he was frustrated by the impeachment. But he says it wasn't about getting people to vote one way or another Martha. MACCALLUM: Very interesting. Jacqui thank you very much. Jacqui Heinrich. So here now Deroy Murdock contributing editor for National Review Online and Katie Pavlich news editor and Richard Fowler Senior Fellow at the New Leaders Council. All are Fox News Contributors. Deroy let me start with you. What's your reaction to Jacqui's story and to the New York Post story? DEROY MURDOCK FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Amazing. The whole thing sounds like a spy novel with this gentleman who only can see eight inches in front of him and dropped off laptops all this other stuff. I think this really goes to the questions that we heard during the whole Ukraine great situation. That Hunter Biden was often his own thing. He never - I think Vice President Biden said he never talked with his son about his business dealings. And this is all his own son's separate world. And now we learn that his son is bringing this Ukrainian businessman to meet with none other than Vice President Biden. So it seems like there's that connection. And I think the most mysterious thing about this is this trip to Moscow that Hunter Biden took. I was in Moscow some years ago. I came home with some matryoshka dolls and some postcards. Hunter Biden came home with $3.5 million from not just from some investment but from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. I'd like to get more information on that. That sounds like Russian collusion to me and certainly a very unusual situation to go to Moscow and come back with $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Very unusual. We need to know a lot more about that. MACCALLUM: So I want to go to Richard but let's pull up these emails that were printed in The New York Post today that are purported to be between Hunter Biden and a Burisma adviser named Vadim Pozharskyi. I'm probably mispronouncing his name. So this was the first one. This is May 12th 2014. And this is from the Burisma adviser to Hunter Biden. We urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence to convey a message signal et cetera to stop what we consider to be politically motivated actions he writes. And remember he was making $50000 a month to be an adviser to Burisma with no former experience in the energy industry business. So then let's go forward a year to April 17th 2015. And this is another email to Hunter Biden purportedly from this Burisma adviser Pozharskyi saying that it was nice to meet Biden's father. He says Dear Hunter thank you for inviting me to D.C. and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spend some time together. It's really an honor and a pleasure. So let me - now I also want to point out the Biden campaign response to this. The New York Post never asked the Biden campaign about the critical elements of the story. They certainly never raised that Rudy Giuliani who's discredited conspiracy theories and alliance with figures connected to Russian intelligence have been widely reported claim to have such materials. Moreover we have reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting has alleged by The New York Post ever took place. Richard your thoughts? RICHARD FOWLER FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well thanks for having me Martha. A couple of points on this I think this is just another attempt by Senator Ron Johnson who two weeks ago his committee came out with a 70 some odd page report indicating that both Joe Biden and Hunter Biden had no wrongdoing here. So let's be very clear. Did Hunter Biden make some mistakes in his career? Absolutely. Are those mistakes worthy of another Homeland Security Senate investigation? Absolutely not. Ron Johnson should be more concerned about ensuring that the American people are kept safe during this global pandemic in which 36 states are seeing an uptick in COVID cases instead of this witch hunt of a story as the president would call it because that's what it is here. There's misinformation. The chain of custody of this particular hard drive seems to be a little bit murky. And once again I think this is just a Hail Mary by Republicans who are losing. The president's having a rally tonight in Iowa. You know why? He won that state handily in 2016 but now he's behind. MACCALLUM: Yes he won Iowa by 10 points that's a valid point and it looks like it's neck and neck right now. Just on that Twitter story because this is the other element here. And Katie I just want you to weigh in on everything but they've also locked down Kayleigh McEnany's account at the moment because she also tweeted this story out which is just extraordinary the coordination between these social media companies that have decided that this thing is so hot and that they have to make sure that they block it. Katie decent questions raised about the validity of this story but what's your take? KATIE PAVLICH  EDITOR: Sure. Well the bottom line is that questions about Hunter Biden's Burisma ties and whether Joe Biden was involved and he repeatedly says that he knew nothing about his son's foreign business dealings his investments especially when he was overseeing the Ukrainian profile and portfolio for the Obama administration. Now if these emails turn out to be valid well that was a lie. And the issue is what people are saying you're going after Hunter Biden. It's a distraction. This is about Joe Biden. This is about Washington D.C. politicians selling out the American taxpayer and using their government position to gain financial or other benefits for their own family members. That is what this is about. And the question is for Hunter Biden did he register as a foreign agent as a number of people have been required to do? Why is it that he was allegedly taking members of the Burisma board who by the way witnesses during the impeachment trial said there was a major conflict of interest and questions from the State Department about the conflict of interest because Burisma was so corrupt. Did that meeting take place? And the Biden campaign's response to say well it wasn't on the official calendar is not really a denial that it happened. And the bottom line is that today Joe Biden called let around 10:30 AM because he doesn't want to answer questions about this topic and he should answer questions because it's about the American people being sold out in favor of Hunter Biden's $83000 a year or a month rather from a very corrupt entity while the vice president is now running for president. What would he do in the Oval Office when it comes to corrupt companies like Burisma that his son may be on the board of? MACCALLUM: It's a good question and I certainly hope that he gets asked that question at the town hall tomorrow night because there are answers to these questions Deroy. One is a question that Hunter Biden could definitely answer. Did you drop off your laptop at this place? And did you have emails between you and this individual on that laptop? That is a question that he should definitely know the answer to. And one of the issues that comes up here Deroy is the lack of hard questions that Joe Biden has faced. And he hasn't because of COVID-19 he hasn't faced that many questions at all over the course of the last several months. MURDOCK: No that's absolutely right and one question I'd ask is Mr. Vice President what did you know and when did you know it? And ask him very specifically what did he know about his son's dealings with these people? Did they in fact have a meeting in the White House or elsewhere where this Ukrainian businessman who apparently sent a thank you note for that meeting did they in fact meet together with the vice president? Another question I'd ask is I believe this came out a bit during the impeachment hearings back late last year I believe it was George Kent of the State Department said that there was some effort to meet with the vice president's staff regarding Hunter Biden who they believed was a distraction and an embarrassment and it was hindering American diplomacy in Ukraine in Eastern Europe. Did that get up to the vice president's attention? Did he learn about this? If he did did he do anything about it? If he didn't hear anything about it that may say something about his management of his own office. And if he had heard about it and didn't it was not forthcoming with the American public then he's dishonest. If it never got to him because his staff was not sharing the sort of thing then perhaps he's incompetent. So either one is not very encouraging for a man who is running for President of the United Status. MACCALLUM: I think about the Amy Coney Barrett hearing today and her talking about the fact that no one is above the law and that the rule of law has to apply equally. And I think about General Michael Flynn. I think about others who were caught up in the Russian collusion scandal and that turned out to be to go nowhere according to Mueller report after two years of investigation. But registering yourself as a foreign agent doing work in a foreign country is one of the things that they were charged with and went to jail for Richard. So is that a question that you would given that situation that it is quite fair to ask and press Hunter Biden on at this point? FOWLER: Look I think we all had troubled family members. And what you have here is Hunter Biden who seems to be a troubled member of the Biden family. But remember just two weeks ago like I said earlier there was a Senate report that investigated all of these things that asked all those questions that got all those answers. And when that report came out almost 80 pages of it which I had the chance to read it shows that there is no wrongdoing by either Vice President Biden or Hunter Biden. That's where the story should begin and that should be where the story should end. These e-mails were probably already asked and answered. And not to mention the fact that the chain of custody on those e-mails are problematic. Why didn't the shop director call the FBI? MACCALLUM:  He did. FOWLER:  Or why didn't he call the FBI directly. Why he didn't get to Rudy Giuliani? Why didn't Rudy Giuliani had it before the -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM:  He did. He extended to -- no he said he went -- well his story and I -- you know I'm with you. I mean there's -- there is a lot of digging that needs to happen on this and I do hope that Vice President Biden at least during a portion of tomorrow night is going to be asked to some of these questions because they are very valid questions than he has said in the past that he had no knowledge of these things. So at the very least he must be pressed on the knowledge that he had and whether or not his memory has changed on any of this. But that is -- that is completely fair game in the questions for the vice president. And he has you know really gotten off it very lightly on all of this. Here comes the president down the staircase. Katie your thoughts -- your thoughts on this before we -- KATIE PAVLICH FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well to say that these questions about Hunter Biden's behavior and the connection to Joe Biden when he was vice president that they all have been asked and answered is completely dishonest. Hunter Biden hasn't testified in front on any committee about this issue he hasn't talked to the FBI about this. There are still a number of questions that have never been asked. And this were to happen to any former vice president who is -- (CROSSTALK) FOWLER:  Well Katie there was an 80-page report. PAVLICH:  Excuse me Richard do not talk to me -- talk over me. I am speaking I didn't interrupt you. If this were a Republican vice president -- (CROSSTALK) FOWLER:  I'm just saying there was an 80-page report that you're not acknowledging. MACCALLUM:  Hold on. Don't talk over each other. PAVLICH:  If this were a former -- if this were a former vice president who happened to be a Republican there would be another special counsel investigation launched to get to the bottom of what happened. And the bottom line too Martha you asked earlier about Twitter and Facebook censoring this type of information the idea of the double standard of their promoting a number of Russia conspiracy theories for years that ended up not being true shows that there is a double standard that they are a publisher not a platform as they continue to claim. MACCALLUM:  All right. Richard quickly what were -- what were you trying to say? FOWLER:  I'm just saying that there no -- there's been no acknowledgment of this 80-page report that was produced by Ron Johnson as the committee of the chair. PAVLICH:  When did Hunter testified? FOWLER:  So the fact that now he is -- it doesn't -- the report who had Senate investigators it was produced and signed by Ron Johnson so for him now to go back and say I want to look at more information seems to be incredible to me especially when the chain of custody of this data -- (CROSSTALK) PAVLICH:  It was an initial report -- MACCALLUM:  OK. FOWLER:  -- that are being in question. MACCALLUM:  Katie hold on. All right. Deroy you know with regard to Twitter and Facebook and Katie's point about this it feels just wrong. I mean I know that some members of the Senate Senate Republicans have said that they want Jack Dorsey to explain what's going on over there. But to put a block on the story which was printed in the New York Post this morning anybody can get their hands on it and their fact-checkers are making a judgment on freezing these accounts that are passing along the story which you know you can bring issue with it and Twitter is full of both sides of the story as it should be. DEROY MURDOCK FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  The American people should be allowed to look at the story judge it a pro or con as they wish. And it's yet another example of these companies that are behaving this way and basically censoring things -- MACCALLUM:  Yes. MURDOCK:  -- while at the same time enjoying the protection of the Communications Decency Act section 230. MACCALLUM:  All right. MURDOCK:  So basically they can protect themselves from lawsuits. MACCALLUM:  I want -- MURDOCK:  They behave like this. They should lose that protection. MACCALLUM:  All right. I want to squeeze in very quickly while we're waiting for the president to come up here. This moment with Nancy Pelosi and Wolf Blitzer yesterday because Richard I know you wanted to talk about the COVID stimulus bill -- this moment got a lot of attention. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D) UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I don't know why you are always an apologist and many of your colleagues apologists for the Republican position. You really don't know what you're talking about. WOLF BLITZER HOST CNN:  It's not about me it's about millions of Americans who can't put food on the table who can't pay the rent and -- (CROSSTALK) PELOSI:  And we represent them. BLITZER:  We're having trouble -- PELOSI:  And we represent them. BLITZER:  Who are troubled getting by -- PELOSI:  And we represent them. BLITZER:  -- these long food lines that we see PELOSI:  We know them. BLITZER:  I know you are. I am sensitive to them because I see them on the street begging for food begging for money. Now Speaker thank you so much. PELOSI:  Have you fed them? We feed them. We feed them. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:  She feeds them Richard. You know this -- the White House is at I believe 1.9 trillion she is at 2.2 trillion. So you've got at least 1.8 trillion 1.9 trillion that is agreed upon. So why not get it out there? FOWLER:  Look I want to deal just like the next person. And I think it's - - I think what you have to remember here is for Speaker Pelosi she's had a deal in place since May. And since May Republicans have dragged their feet while 30 million Americans were unemployed they drag their feet while small businesses close their doors. They dragged their feet while school have been totally reopened and -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM:  There been already trillions of dollars that have gone out Ricahrd. In fact 500 billion of it hasn't even been spent yet. That's the first thing that Congress needs to do -- (CROSSTALK) FOWLER:  Well this is -- MACCALLUM:  -- just authorize the spending on that money that's already there. FOWLER:  Absolutely. Absolutely. But this goes back to administrative mismanagement. Remember two weeks ago Donald Trump called off negotiations altogether. The president's strategy on this has been terrible. And when it comes to Speaker Pelosi since May she has had a bill in place and Republicans refused they refused to take it up. MACCALLUM:  All right. We're going to dip in here. He's talking about this Hunter Biden situation. Let's see what the president is saying in Iowa Des Moines Iowa tonight. DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  -- his son's corrupt business dealing. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:  And this is a big smoking gun the newly uncovered e-mails revealed that a top executive from the highly questionable Ukrainian company it's an energy company which paid Hunter at least $50000 a month but it's now looking like it could be $183000 a month that's a lot of money. Would anybody in this audience take it? I'll take it. We'll take it. Despite the fact that he had absolutely no experience knew nothing about energy -- wrote to Hunter arranging for a meeting to meet with Vice President Joe Biden. I've been saying this for a long time with that family the same Ukrainian energy executive even sent Hunter an e-mail saying quote ""we urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence."" In other words Hunter was being paid for access to his vice president father who was specifically put in charge of Ukraine and Russia. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:  How about the Russia hoax? It turns out that they were the ones that did the Russia hoax. It was them. No collusion. No collusion. These e-mails show that Biden's repeated claim that he has never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings were a complete lie. It was a total lie. He lied to you over and over because he's trying to cover up a massive pay- for-play scandal at the heart of his vice presidency. And everybody knows it. Everybody in Washington knows it. We've known it for a long time. The fact is there was never an administration more corrupt than Obama- Biden administration. There was never. Never. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:  Just weeks ago Joe stood before the American people in a presidential debate and told you that these claims have been totally discredited and that his son did nothing wrong. But now that turns out to be a total lie. Now we can see clearly that Biden is a corrupt politician who shouldn't even be allowed to run for the presidency. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  I was pressing Joe Biden to tell the truth because the corrupt mainstream media right back there all of those cameras right back there - - (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:  They are corrupt. And they refused to write the story. There wasn't one time in almost four years during my presidency -- during the greatest political scandal in U.S. history a witch hunt a horrible horrible disgusting witch hunt that should never ever happen to another presidency again. And people should pay for the crimes they committed. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  Which turns out to be a totally illegal hoax that false and libelous stories every day. False and libelous stories and they knew they were false too. They knew they were false. They were never taken down by a Twitter or Facebook or the mainstream media never once. Yet with Biden today they take negative posts down almost before they even go up. They're trying to protect them. They are trying to protect Biden. They take him down. And I was just getting off that magnificent plane behind us Air Force One. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP:  And I had heard and I just don't know this for a fact but they say Kayleigh McEnany -- you know Kayleigh right? (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  Kayleigh McEnany. Good Kayleigh. She is so great. She is incredible. They close down her account. She is the White House press secretary. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:  Because she is reporting the truth. They close down her account. So let's see what's going to happen. And did you hear the news? Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  Bruce Ohr him and his wonderful wife Molly. She wrote all of this stuff and then he goes and he works the Department of Justice and he took -- didn't he bring it to the FBI? The wife writes it she gets paid a lot of money. Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. That's good a couple of years too late that's all. He should be not only in the Department of Justice outbox. He should be someplace else. OK? Eight months after his alleged meeting with the Burisma executives. So these Burisma Burisma they say pronounce it Burisma a real beautiful company. Vice President Joe Biden went to the Ukraine and threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid if they did not fire the prosecutor that was investigating his son and the company that his son worked for. That's Burisma. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  The documents also show that before one of Joe's trips to Ukraine Hunter e-mailed his business partner saying his lucrative contract should begin now. Think of that. Should begin now. Right now. It's got to begin. It's -- the whole thing is so incredible. He's -- look let's just put it in simple language. He got thrown out of the military that's unfortunate. He didn't have a job for a long time. His father becomes vice president and he is making millions and millions and millions of dollars a year. Think of it. No think of it. Think of it. It's like the Hillary stuff the crooked Hillary and it's the crooked Joe. You know when a Democrat voted here in Iowa asked Joe last year you remember his son raked in money in exchange for providing access. Joe called that man a damn liar. You're a damn liar. The kid is making millions of dollars. He had nothing. He didn't have a job. Thrown out of the military sadly but thrown out of the military. And he knew nothing about energy he knew nothing about investments knew nothing about China. How about he walked away a billion and a half dollars to manage for China. They don't do that with the most brilliant people on Wall Street. Vice President Biden you owe the people of America an apology because it turns out you are a corrupt politician. OK? (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  Joe Biden must immediately release all e-mails meetings phone calls transcripts and records related to his involvement to his family's business dealings. Influence patent around the worlds including China and including Russia. Including Russia. Hunter raked in a fortune from China while Joe Biden was giving China all of our jobs. They came -- you know where they came from Iowa and plenty of other places but they came from Iowa. He was giving them. They were taking our jobs they were taking our factories they were taking everything. They were taking her wealth. And I gave you $28 billion. You say thank you very much President Xi. It came right out of China. Because of that everybody is happy in Iowa. I just hope you remember that on November 3rd. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  I hope you remember. Nobody else would've done it. Nobody else would have done it. The Biden family treated the vice presidency as a for-profit corporation flying around the globe collecting millions of dollars from China and Ukraine and Russia and other countries. In fact the wife of the mayor of Moscow gave Hunter Biden a check for $3.5 million in cash while his father gave away the store to Russia including Crimea. Remember Crimea? The Biden's got rich while America got robbed. By contrast and this is so true and so easily true and I'm so proud of it in so many ways. I have given up billions of dollars to serve as your president. It is my greatest honor of a lifetime. So true. (CROWD CHEERING) (CROWD CHANTING) TRUMP:  I ran for president because I could not sit back any longer and watch the terrible injustices being done to the American people. And it's true. And by the way before the China plague came in we had the greatest economy in the history of the world and now it's going right back there. Our stock market is very close to a number that was even higher. Does everybody have your 401K ready? Because it's going through the roof. We are going to have the best year we've ever had. And we're going to have tax cuts not tax increases. They want to increase your taxes. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  They want to increase your taxes so they can spend it on the Green New Deal. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:  So I know that beauty. I cannot sit idly by and watch career politicians like Joe Biden continue bleeding this country dry. And that's what it is. You know you can say whatever you want you can say whatever you want but when you have a kid that follows with his father -- and by the way take a look at his brother his brother all of a sudden is building a big housing development in Iraq. Have you ever built a development before? No I haven't. Take a look at the whole family it's a corrupt family. Joe Biden personifies the selfless and corrupt globalist who got rich and powerful at your expense. Take a look at the people that are funding his campaign. People assume that they'd be funding my campaign. I don't want them. We don't want them. We never needed them. We don't want them. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  But they betrayed American workers disparage American values and crushed our middle-class. For decades Biden and his cronies laughed while they shipped millions of your jobs to their friends in foreign countries and countries that you've never even heard of. They live behind gated walls and they flooded your communities with illegal immigration deadly drugs MS-13 savages that assault rape and murder innocent Americans. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  They force our fellow citizens to live in crumbling inner cities while they spent trillions of dollars on never ending foreign wars. They just never end ended. But you know we are bringing all our soldiers back home. You know that. We've been doing it for a long time. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  And it's not easy. Not easy. The military industrial complex not the easiest thing. But we are bringing them back home. We're almost finished in Afghanistan coming in we are dealing we're down to a small number coming home by the end of the year hopefully by the end of the year shortly thereafter. In Syria we're out totally out. And by the way we crushed. Before I did this we crushed 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  One hundred percent. We crushed a 100 percent. We have the greatest military in the world and by the way we have built the greatest military in the world. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  So I just tell you from Iowa you know you are very powerful state politically you're a big state to me big in your heart. But you have a tremendous influence and a tremendous power and you've never let me down. You just came in and we won by so much. You know they say if a Republican win by one point I think I won by 11 right? Eleven. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP:  That was early in the night remember that? They said Donald Trump has won the state of Iowa. Then they said man he won by 11 points what's going on? That was just the beginning. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  Then we won Ohio we won Ohio by eight points. They said what's going on? You know that's one thing you want to say. But when you win by a lot -- and that was the beginning of something. And I'll tell you what we have more enthusiasm now than we ever did four years ago. There really is. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  And we have great poll numbers. Although you know you see a lot of the fake poll numbers. They're doing -- they'll do anything they can they're called suppression polls. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:  Yes there they go. Look. Look at the red lights they start to go off as I start to point. You know in one way they want the ratings in another way they don't want the ratings. And you're telling CNN that they are fraud and they're broadcasting. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  That was one of the greatest -- that was one of the greatest evenings ever. There were those who would say it was a most exciting evening in the history of television highest rated evening in the history of television. And you know what? The election we have coming up on November 3rd is actually more important. It's actually more important. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP:  In 2016 you voted to fire the failed and decrepit political class and you elected an outsider as your president and I finally put America first. It's called make America great again. (CROWD CHEERING) (CROWD CHANTING) TRUMP:  It's windy out here. If you can wear the hat I can wear the hat. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  Should I take off the tie or not? What do you think? I don't know. Maybe yes? (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  That feels so much better. That feels better. That feels good. Now we can just relax and have a good time. No but it's a -- it's great to be with you. Seriously we've had a great history here together. What we've done for you and what we've done for the farmers and what we've done for everything. You know two weeks ago you have the largest order of corn in the history of our country. Right? (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  Two weeks ago you had the largest order of soybeans in the history of our country and the largest order of beef. But you know why? Because China wants to keep me happy. That's why. It was from China because they know what they've done to us should never have been allowed. They could have stopped it. They didn't stop it. They should've stopped it. The only reason I'm your president is because the previous administration did a poor job. So poor in fact that I said I'm going to run for president. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  And you know what if they did a good job I wouldn't have run. And if they did a good job I guess I wouldn't have won. What you think. I wouldn't have run and I wouldn't have won. But they were so bad and it turns out they were so totally corrupt. We did not come this far to overcome this much and fight this hard only to surrender our country back to the depraved Washington swamp. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  You know when I would say drain the swamp. I used to say it you know drain the swamp and people like it. I hated the expression. I hated it. I hated it. I said this is a hokey expression. And I put it in one speech the place went crazy. I said I'm starting to like that expression. Then I put it in another speech and they went crazy. I said you know I really like it. I really like it. But you know when I say drain the swamp I had no idea the swamp was that dirty that disgusting and that deep. It's true. If I don't sound like a typical Washington politician it's because I'm not a politician. Thank God. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  And I don't want to insult our great politicians because you had some great ones with us tonight. But I don't always played by the rules of Washington and Washington establishment it's because I was elected to fight for you harder than -- and I'll tell you what. I fight for you harder than any president has ever fought for anyone. It's not easy. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  But I love it because we are making tremendous progress. We are making tremendous progress. And the fact is that no administration in their first three and a half years have ever done as much as this administration has done. You take a look at the list. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:  And you know it's amazing because they always challenge you they challenge you and everything. They never even challenged me on that statement. I make that statement all the time they just stand and they think they say he's right. We might hate him but they say he's right. Right now I'm fighting to eradicate the virus rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. And that's exactly what we're doing. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP:  As a candidate Joe Biden has made yet another corrupt bargain in exchange for his party's domination. He handed control to the socialist and Marxists and the lunatic left-wing fringe that are really running that party. He is not running it. Let's face it. Joe is shot. Whether you like it or not we can all be nice it's going to be my turn someday it's even going to be your turn someday my friends someday. But you know when it is your turn you can't be president. One thing I've learned President Xi of China he's a 100 percent. Putin of Russia 100 percent. Kim Jong-un by the way whatever happened to that war we're supposed to have? Kim Jong-un of North Korea 100 hundred percent. These people are sharp and they are smart. Joe has lost it. And his best day he wasn't a smart man. Everybody knows that. But Joe is gone. If he wins the radical left will be running the country they are addicted to power. And God help us if they get it. We'll never be the same country and we will never be able to recover and we are -- MACCALLUM:  All right. The president is touching a pretty heavily in the beginning part of the speech on this Hunter Biden Joe Biden story that was reported by the New York Post today. And we have gone through those e-mails between the Ukrainian businessman and the origins of the e-mail or purportedly according to the New York Post from a laptop that was found in Wilmington Delaware. So obviously there's a lot that needs to be dug into. On that story I want to be -- I want to bring back in our guest tonight. Our panel Deroy Murdock contributing editor for National Review online Katie Pavlich news editor at https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__Townhall.com&amp;d=DwICAg&amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;r=66NL-BOo471AGSm_KnwRE_qfHEjM19jJhbDYidH1S1U&amp;m=7g9wYo0tBbCvcoDL3Q6U5oS6m-G-CcUAChPq3gLmFlk&amp;s=OVNf15OcffhctaAQa5GF3m-wLvXo4iiBBBOyoGssvS4&amp;e=  and Richard Fowler senior fellow at the New York -- at the New Leader's Council. All are Fox News contributors. I actually would like to start by playing by getting back to the meat of this race and playing a sound bite. Earlier this week there was a very interesting poll from Gallup asking people are you better off now than you were four years ago. And 56 percent according to the Gallup poll said they were. And obviously that's the argument that Trump is making out there in Iowa tonight. And then Joe Biden was asked about it and here's what he said. Here's his response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So why should people who feel that they are better off today under the Trump administration vote for you? JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well if they think that they probably shouldn't. They think 54 percent of the American people are better off economically today than they were on our administration. Well their memories are not very good quite frankly. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:  Richard what do you think about that? FOWLER:  Listen I'm not sure if I would've answered the same way the vice president did. But I think this is just a -- it's just one poll. I think if you look across what's actually happening in the economy you will see that there are many people that are suffering tonight. Right? There are many business owners that have had to close their doors and they might not reopen them again. There are many families that are trying to figure out how to make ends meet because mom or dad might be unemployed because they were a service worker they might not be returning to work. MACCALLUM:  Yes. FOWLER:  And while Donald Trump says he's trying to eradicate COVID-19 what you see here is a mass gathering where some people are wearing masks and some people aren't where nobody is socially distanced. And this is happening when there are 36 states that are moving in the wrong direction when it comes to this virus. MACCALLUM:  All right. Katie what do you say? PAVLICH:  Well this is going to be an election about whether people want to go back to an Obama-Biden presidency. Much of Joe Biden's platform has been about citing what he worked on with President Obama. Whether people want to go back to anemic GDP growth from quarter to quarter or the slowest economic recovery since World War II or whether they want to go back to the beginning of the Trump administration and what the administration was able to do in the first three years in office. The president has used the line off and on the campaign trail that he has done more in his first term than Joe Biden did in 47 years in Washington D.C. And so that's going to be the economic choice that people have moving forward. MACCALLUM:  Yes. PAVLICH:  And for Joe Biden to stand in front of two vote signs and tell people not to vote for him doesn't -- really is a reflection of the enthusiasm that people have for his campaign. MACCALLUM:  Final thought Deroy Murdock on where this election stands with 20 days to go. MURDOCK:  I think that the census bureau came up with some very interesting information a couple weeks ago which is under President Trump and his policies we achieve the highest level of median national -- median household income and the lowest poverty level in U.S. history. All of that unfortunately was interrupted by the China virus. And now we are bouncing back. The economy is returning. And the question is do we want to go back to the policies we have that made this country so effective and so prosperous before the coronavirus or do we want to go to back to policies of Obama and Biden where we basically struggled around and barely move forward for eight years. I hope the American people vote for the policies that had us in excellent shape until COVID-19 arrived and created such total havoc. MACCALLUM:  Well the polls are definitely not looking in the president's favor right now. Today Politico talked about three races at the Cook Politico report moved a little bit further to the left in Alaska in Texas and in Georgia for the Senate races. So we will see where thing goes. It's going to be an intense 20 days. Thank you very much to all of you. Good to have you with us Deroy Katie and Richard. (CROSSTALK) PAVLICH:  Thanks Martha. FOWLER:  Good to see you Martha. MACCALLUM:  Always great to have you with us tonight. Thank you very much. So that is THE STORY of this Wednesday October the 14th 2020. THE STORY continues tomorrow night so I'll see you right back here tomorrow. We are going to dig in to this Biden story that we have been discussing. We've got Mayor Rudy Giuliani with us. We've got Senator Ron Johnson to answer some questions about his previous report. And we will see you back here tomorrow night. Have a great night everybody. We'll see you then.

304,Are Democrats sitting on claims to derail Barrett nomination?," This is a rush transcript from “Tucker Carlson Tonight"" October 14 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Most of us never imagined it could happen in this country and yet today it did happen.  A major American newspaper published a story apparently an entirely accurate story about a presidential candidate. The tech monopolies that control American media feared this story might hurt that candidate whom they favor.  So three weeks before a national election they shut the whole thing down. They prevented the public from reading the news. They didn't apologize for doing this. They didn't bother to make up reasonable sounding justifications for it. They just did it exactly as the Chinese government does.  These are monopolies. They have all the power you have none. They don't have to care what you think and they don't.  This was mass censorship on a scale that America has never experienced not in 245 years and it's a threat to all of us. Democracies only function when there is a free exchange of information between citizens. We no longer have that. This is a dark moment. Here are the details.  This morning ""The New York Post"" published a series of e-mails that describe Hunter Biden's lucrative relationship with Ukrainian energy company called Burisma and then described how his father then the Vice President of the United States intervened to help his son peddle influence.  Now we've known the outlines of the story for quite some time. But these e-mails add damning detail. No one appears to dispute that they are real not even the Joe Biden campaign. You're hearing whispers tonight that it is all part of a Russian disinformation campaign.  If this is a hoax it is the most complex sophisticated hoax ever perpetrated. It doesn't seem possible. There are too many there's too much detail.  These e-mails came from a laptop an Apple laptop that was dropped off at a Delaware computer repair shop last year and then abandoned there. After a certain number of days with no payment the shop's owner took legal possession of the laptop. He looked inside. There were tens of thousands of e-mails including exchanges with representatives of foreign companies and foreign governments.  The laptop apparently belonged to Hunter Biden. The shop owner was stunned by this by the appearance of corruption and he was afraid for his family.  So late last year he gave the laptop to the F.B.I. he kept a copy of the hard drive for himself. But he never heard back from the F.B.I.  By May he was anxious. So we made overtures to Senator Mike Lee's office and at least one conservative nonprofit. He emailed their websites but no one responded.  Finally the man contacted Rudy Giuliani's office and today's story is the result of that.  Well the tech monopolies instantly crushed at the moment it appeared. An executive at Facebook called Andy Stone a former Democratic staffer announced that his company would censor ""The New York Post"" story. As he put it Facebook would be quote ""reducing its distribution on our platform.""  Twitter quickly followed suit by locking ""The New York Post's"" entire Twitter account.  One of the biggest newspapers in the world banned from Twitter. Twitter then prevented its users from sharing ""The New York Post"" story both privately and publicly. Those who tried to share it got this message quote ""Your tweet couldn't be sent because this link has been identified by Twitter or a partner as being potentially harmful."" Harmful?  In a separate explanation Twitter wrote this quote ""We don't permit the use of our services to directly distribute content obtained through hacking that contains private information may put people in physical harm or danger or contains trade secrets.""  Yes the same Twitter that just promoted a ""New York Times"" story about the President's private tax returns obviously obtained illegally that Twitter And who by the way was hacked here? No one was hacked. Twitter never addressed that.  As for quote ""trade secrets"" there were none. We already knew that Hunter Biden was trading on his father's office to make 50 grand a month from the Ukrainians. In October he admitted it.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  QUESTION:  You didn't have any extensive knowledge about natural gas or Ukraine itself though.  HUNTER BIDEN SON OF JOE BIDEN:  No but I think that I had as much knowledge as anybody else that was on the Board if not more.  QUESTION:  In the list you gave me the reasons why you're on that Board you did not list the fact that you were the son of the Vice President.  H. BIDEN:  Of course no.  QUESTION:  What role do you think that played?  H. BIDEN:  I think that it is impossible for me to be on any of the Boards that I just mentioned without saying that I'm the son of the Vice President of the United States.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON:  Oh thanks for acknowledging reality. So we knew the outlines. What we didn't know until today was how brazen this was.  Hunter Biden didn't simply sell access to his father the Vice President or take cash to influence American foreign policy. You know it's weirder than that.  As he schemed to extract more money from Burisma Hunter Biden didn't refer to his father as his father. He referred to Joe Biden the Vice President as quote ""my guy.""  On April 13 2014 for example Hunter Biden wrote this to his business partner quote ""The announcement of my guy's upcoming travels should be characterized as part of our advice and thinking"" end quote.  Hunter Biden added that he needed to be quote ""protected financially"" and wanted a long term role with Burisma. Quote ""The contract should begin now not after the upcoming visit of my guy. That should include a retainer in the range of $25000.00.""  It's not clear if Biden got that retainer but we know he did get a high paying job at Burisma. Then in May 2014 just weeks after Hunter Biden joined the board of that company a top executive there let him know why he was being paid very explicitly quote ""We urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence to convey a message/signal et cetera to stop what we consider to be politically motivated actions.""  The executive wrote that in an e-mail quote ""Use your influence to convey a message."" What message? What does that mean?  Well another e-mail from the same executive obtained by ""The New York Post"" dated April 17 2015 explains in very clear terms what it means quote ""Dear Hunter thank you for inviting me to D.C. and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spend some time together. It's really an honor and pleasure.""  Oh that's what you're not allowed to read. And you can see why Facebook and Twitter don't want to allow you to read it.  If Joe Biden met with Burisma executives at the request of his son for the profit of his own family it becomes very clear that Joe Biden's previous denials were lies. Just last year Joe Biden was telling us he had no idea what his son was doing at Burisma.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  QUESTION:  You were the Vice President running point on Ukraine. The average Joe hears that and says that sounds fishy. What's your understanding of what your son was doing for an extraordinary amount of money?  JOE BIDEN (D) DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I don't know what he was doing. I know he was on the Board. I found out he was on the Board after he was on the Board and that was it.  And there's nobody --  QUESTION:  You had a lot of time. Isn't this something you want to get to the bottom of?  J. BIDEN:  No because I trust my son.  QUESTION:  But that doesn't pass the smell test. Like when you're the Vice President isn't there a higher standard? Don't you need to know what's happening with your family? Don't you need to put down some guardrails?  J. BIDEN:  Unless there was something that was -- there was something on its face that was wrong. There's nothing on its face that was wrong.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON:  Nothing on its face that was wrong. That was before we saw these e-mails.  You'll remember that back in 2018 Joe Biden explained that he got the top prosecutor in Ukraine fired. That prosecutor Viktor Shokin said he was planning to investigate Burisma when he was stripped of his job.  Here's how Joe Biden explained/bragged about how he canned Victor Shokin.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  J. BIDEN:  I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor and they did. So they said they had it -- I walked out the press conference and I said I am not going to -- we're not going to give you the billion dollars. They said you have no authority. You're not the President. The President said -- I said call him.  I said I'm telling you're not getting the billion dollars. I said you're not getting the billion and I'm going to be leaving here. And I think it was what? Six hours. I looked at him and I said I am leaving in six hours and if the prosecutor is not fired you're not getting the money. Well son of a bitch he got fired.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON:  Why is the Vice President of the United States firing prosecutors in Ukraine? Pause for a moment and ask yourself that. That's bizarre behavior. It doesn't help the United States in any way. Why was he doing that?  At the time Biden's handlers denied there was anything wrong with this. They just said Shokin was corrupt and somehow the world was benefiting by Shokin getting fired. They didn't explain how we benefit from that.  But of course Joe Biden didn't do it for his son. He didn't know anything about Burisma. He didn't know what Hunter Biden was up to. No clue.  Then last October we showed you a photograph of Joe and Hunter Biden golfing with a Board member of Burisma Hunter Biden's business partner a man called Devon Archer.  The Biden campaign never explained that photograph. Our media of course never really followed up. Instead just as they are now rushing to bury ""The New York Post"" story CNN rushed in to Joe Biden's defense.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  ANDERSON COOPER CNN HOST:  The Impeachment Inquiry is centered on President Trump's attempts to get political dirt from Ukraine on Vice President Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Vice President President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company Board in Ukraine. Or to point out there's no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON:  A few months later we got some sense why Anderson Cooper was so careful in the interview you just saw. In December a voter in Iowa tried to ask Joe Biden about Burisma and his fitness for office Joe Biden lost control of himself. He called the man fat and then challenged him to a push up contest.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  J. BIDEN:  That's not true and no one has ever said that.  And you want to check my shape let's do push-ups together man. Let's do this one. Let's do whatever you want to do. Let's take --   [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]  J. BIDEN:  You said I set up my son to work in an oil company. Ain't that what you said? Get your words straight Jack. But look here's the deal.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON:  Here's the deal. What is the deal actually? That's a question every American no matter what your political view is has a right to an answer.  You might be wondering what Joe Biden thinks by the way of today's news unfortunately you are not entitled to that information either. Joe Biden once again called it a day before noon that meant reporters couldn't ask him about ""The New York Post"" story not that they wanted to.  We'd like to. We're not controlled by Facebook or Google or Twitter. We can ask any question we want. And here's the first question. Did any money from Burisma or any other foreign company or foreign government wind up in Joe Biden's pockets or in the account of any entity he benefits from?  We're not accusing Joe Biden of a crime. We're saying it has long been a mystery how a man who took a government salary for almost 50 years has lived like a rich man since the 1970s. Have you ever seen Joe Biden's houses? Look them up.  Opulent doesn't begin to describe the way he lives. Can you do that? No you can't.  So how did Joe Biden do that? No one seems especially interested in finding out but we are and we may. There were a lot of e-mails on that laptop in Delaware tens of thousands of e-mails.  ""The New York Post"" is not the only news organization that has copies of those e-mails. They're out there. So stay tuned.  Tonight though ""The New York Post"" broke this story and deserves full credit for it. Miranda Devine is a journalist there. We're happy to have her on tonight. Miranda thanks for coming on and in the future when there is a free speech Supreme Court case I hope your name is attached to the winning side of it based on this.  But before we get to the crackdown on ""The New York Post"" story tell me what you think we learned from the pieces you wrote on these e-mails?  MIRANDA DEVINE JOURNALIST ""THE NEW YORK POST"":  Well this story is not conjecture. It is actually e-mails from Hunter Biden's laptop and it shows evidence that quite contrary to Joe Biden's protestations that he knows nothing about Hunter Biden's business dealings doesn't know anything about Burisma it actually shows a connection between Joe Biden Hunter Biden and a senior executive at Burisma.  There's one of the e-mails that we published today shows that you know Hunter Biden was arranging a meeting in 2015 when his father was Vice President with a senior executive of Burisma. And there's another e-mail that thanks Hunter Biden for arranging that meeting.  And you know we also have published photographs. One of the photographs that we published today shows Hunter Biden asleep with a crack pipe in his mouth. Now we didn't publish that gratuitously. We published it as an illustration of how strange it is that these overseas companies these foreign entities would pay Hunter Biden millions of dollars someone who has an admitted drug problem. And there are other photographs like that on this laptop spanning over five years.  So you have a situation where Burisma a corrupt energy company is paying the son of the Vice President up to $83000.00 per month for no discernible reason because he doesn't have any experience in the energy industry. He has a proven drug problem.  The only possible reason that is plausible is that he was being paid for his access to his father and so what we see is a cash for influence scandal involving the Biden family and Joe Biden has never satisfactorily answered this.  There is now evidence that he needs to answer and what did he do today? He hid. He did not come out and call a press conference as you would have expected him to do to plead innocence to answer these allegations.  Nothing. Not a word.  All that happened was that there was a statement from his campaign calling our story all of those e-mails and photographs that were on Hunter Biden's laptop that we published calling our story discredited. And the only actual concrete point that it made in reference to our story was to say that they had reviewed Joe Biden's official calendar for the time and they could find no meeting on that official calendar.  And you know I don't think that Joe Biden even him I don't think he is silly enough to have logged one of those meetings as official.  CARLSON:  Of course not. That is exactly right. Miranda Devine thanks so much for joining us.  This is a FOX News alert. We have just heard from the CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey. He tweeted this quote ""Our communication around our actions on 'The New York Post' article was not great. And blocking URL sharing via Twitter DM with zero context as to why we're blocking unacceptable."" Huh? Writes like a child and manages a company like one too.  By the way the Biden campaign is able to call the story quote ""discredited"" because Big Tech is trying to discredit it. No reporter has taken a look at the story and concluded oh sure. This is a Russian fabrication. Putin did this. That's ridiculous.  So the Biden campaign is using Big Tech as a pretext for not responding and Big Tech of course is trying to prevent you from reading it at all.  Where does this go from here? If Biden is elected do you think -- do you really think that the Big Tech companies are going to stop doing the bidding of their masters in Washington? Not a chance. You think Big Tech is going to suddenly think oh you're allowed to think for yourself? No.  Last night in the show we questioned whether masks are really effective with the transmission of the coronavirus for example and as we did that we cited data directly from the C.D.C. We pulled it off their website as well as other scientific sources. ""Science Magazine"" for example.  One study found that more than 70 percent of patients who contracted the coronavirus said they had always worn a mask; another 14 percent said they usually did. We told you that last night. We posted that segment on Facebook.  Today we learned that Facebook is calling our reporting quote ""partly false."" We quoted the C.D.C. They restricted the distribution of the post prevent people from seeing it.  Again we can't say this enough. The data that we put on television last night were from the Centers for Disease Control. We used their numbers we didn't make them up but Facebook censored it.  Where is this going exactly? Saagar Enjeti is an opinion host at ""The Hill."" We're happy to have him tonight. Saagar thanks for joining us. Where is this going?  SAAGAR ENJETI OPINION HOST ""THE HILL"":  Thanks Tucker. Tucker I mean this is a great moment in American history. This is actually a declaration of war by the Big Tech companies in this particular case.  We need to understand this for what it is. This is an in-kind donation in the hundreds of millions of dollars to the Joe Biden campaign. These are rules that are flatly false on their face. Think about the material that you laid out. Hacked material is not to be distributed on Twitter. Does that mean that Edward Snowden's account is going to be locked immediately? Does that mean that The Pentagon Papers could not be published? Does that not mean that F.B.I. COINTELPRO?  Let's even think about this. They said that Twitter said that they could not distribute the story because they couldn't verify the origins. So does that mean that every single story based upon anonymous sources out of our government is going to be locked and banned from Twitter or slowed down as they put it from Facebook? No.  These rules are selectively enforced in a political manner by the most powerful people and the most powerful companies on Earth. All of your viewers need to understand that.  CARLSON:  So our viewers should also understand that it's not simply Facebook and Twitter Facebook and Twitter are the primary means of revenue for almost all digital media. We happen to work in one of the rare media that is not dependent on it which is why we can have this conversation.  But if Biden wins does this get better? I mean why would the tech companies stop doing the bidding of the Democratic Party if the Democratic Party had more power?  ENJETI:  Well it's hard to see how it gets better when Kamala Harris's Press Secretary is the Chief Communications over at Twitter or have the person who announces on Facebook that things are going to be slowed down on this Hunter Biden story is himself a former Democratic operative.  Take a look at the Big Tech space Tucker. The Vice President of Amazon Communications Jay Carney the former White House Press Secretary before that former chief aide to Joe Biden. Several of the people on his transition team are traced to the Big Tech companies.  Look at where all of their money is going. You can -- this is public record. Look at the public data of where all of their donations are going. Are they going to get better?  Eric Schmidt Google Facebook we all know they were never more powerful than they were under the Obama administration. Under a Joe Biden administration it will be 10 maybe 15 to 20 times what it was then.  CARLSON:  Yes at some point soon we're going to do a show where we just read the names of all the Republicans people you voted for or sent money to who refused to lift a finger to save you from what you correctly described as this grave moment in American history. You're absolutely right.  Saagar Enjeti great to see you. Thank you.  ENJETI:  Thank you Tucker.  CARLSON:  I want to tell you by the way that we received a response tonight from the C.D.C. about our segment last night on facemask. A spokesman for the C.D.C. said that our coverage was misleading.  The spokesman didn't dispute that we had showed accurate data from the C.D.C. including that 85 percent of people who tested positive for coronavirus in July reported wearing a mask always or often. Instead the spokesman said this quote ""At no time has C.D.C. guidance suggested that masks were intended to protect the wearers."" Huh? At no time has the C.D.C. suggested that masks were intended to protect people who wear masks. That's what they said tonight.  Now that would be news to the Director of the C.D.C. Robert Redfield. Here he was last month.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DR. ROBERT REDFIELD DIRECTOR CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION:  I might even go so far as to say that this facemask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON:  This is the C.D.C.? They're protecting us from this pandemic. They don't even know what their own Director is saying.  But whatever you do don't question public health experts. Facebook and Twitter and Google will shut you down. Just put your mask on and obey.  Up next it was day three of Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings. How did it go? We'll talk to the person who prepared her for this week just after the break.  Plus we will continue to monitor the Trump rally underway in Des Moines tonight. Any news we will bring it to you.  DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And I went to the hospital and it's an incredible hospital Walter Reed. I've seen what they've done because I've been there many times for our great warriors that come back so badly wounded.  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  CARLSON:  Today was the third day in a row of Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings. You may have watched maybe you didn't. We'd like to assess them and we found the perfect person.  Megan Wold is a former Supreme Court clerk. She helped Amy Coney Barrett prepare this week and we're happy to have her on tonight. Megan Wold thanks so much for joining us.  MEGAN WOLD FORMER SUPREME COURT CLERK:  Thank you Tucker and thanks for having me.  At the outset I just wanted to note again the extraordinary thing that President Trump did in nominating Judge Amy Coney Barrett for a seat on the United States Supreme Court. Judge Barrett is a normal American and President Trump has nominated her to one of the highest positions in our government a position that members of the ruling class usually reserve for one of their own.  But Judge Barrett does not have an Ivy League degree. She hasn't amassed a series of titles in the Federal bureaucracy. She doesn't have the patronage of congressmen and senators. She's a normal American.  And as our viewers have seen over the last two days that has not stopped Democrats from attacking her relentlessly often absurdly trying to get her to commit to their policy preferences in the law knowing full well that Judge Barrett cannot do so because as a sitting Member of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals it would violate her judicial oath.  CARLSON:  Right.  WOLD:  Judge Barrett was well prepared for these types of questions which are entirely predictable and actually asking for those commitments tells us more about what Democrats think about what judges do.  Democrats think that judges are really just politics by another means and that if you cannot convince the American people to support your policies legislatively then you impose them by judicial fiats.  And as Judge Barrett has repeatedly made clear over the last two days; that is the furthest thing from her judicial philosophy.  CARLSON:  But that is -- and that's the appealing part but I just -- something I've noticed tonight and it's not germane to the law really but I can't help mentioning it. She is obviously very smart and learned. She clearly has spent a lot of time getting the details down and I'm impressed by that.  But what I'm most impressed by is that in contrast to the usual grasping soulless mercenaries that make up our managerial class she seems like she is rooted in her family and I admire that. Is that as real as it seems?  WOLD:  That is absolutely as real as it seems and it is what I admire as well. I have seen the way that Judge Barrett has prepared for these hearings with binders and marathon study sessions moot courts thinking through her answers just as any nominee would do.  But what I know and what I think any person who knew Judge Barrett before the past week would have told you and will tell you is that the single greatest thing that Judge Barrett could have done and did do to prepare for this moment is simply the way that she has lived her life.  The poise and the grace that she has exhibited during these days of grueling questioning simply cannot be faked.  CARLSON:  Yes well good for her. And I know you're not supposed to think it's important when people have happy personal lives and seven children but I don't care. I do think it's important really important.  WOLD:  That's right Judge Barrett.  CARLSON:  Good for her and good for you for saying that.  WOLD:  Thank you Judge Barrett has spent her lifetime cultivating an intellect and preparing herself rigorously.  CARLSON:  Well and that's obvious. Megan Wold you are a great explainer of this and an asset to her. I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you.  WOLD:  Thank you Tucker. I appreciate it.  CARLSON:  Well something kind of amazing happened yesterday. Mazie Hirono who many believe is the dullest U.S. Senator in American history has taken control of the Merriam Webster dictionary. She is in charge of what words you're allowed to use. She defines the English language.  It's pretty amazing. We'll tell you how she got so powerful after the break.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  CARLSON:  If you weren't fully awake as you watched yesterday's Supreme Court confirmation hearings you may have missed Amy Coney Barrett who seems like a decent person saying something deeply offensive.  We're going to replay it for you for its news value. We want to preface that with an NC 70 warning. Here's what she said.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT U.S. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  I have no agenda and I do want to be clear that I have never discriminated on the basis of sexual preference and would not ever discriminate on the basis of sexual preference.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON:  Yes you heard it. Sexual preference. It's hard to watch that. Fortunately Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirono was in the building to prevent future generations from having to live with filth like that spoken aloud. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI):  Not once but twice you used the term sexual preference to describe those in the LGBTQ community and let me make clear sexual preference is an offensive and outdated term. It is used by anti- LGBTQ activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a choice. It is not.  Sexual orientation is a key part of a person's identity.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON:  So the world is falling apart. China is taking over the world. The American economy is in shambles and there's a presidential election three weeks but luckily America's dumbest Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii is upset about the right things the term sexual preference it's a slur.  As it turns out she didn't know that herself until some left-wing Twitter personality made that discovery yesterday morning.  But things move fast by afternoon Democrats were repeating it in the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearings. And by evening our dictionary the Merriam Webster dictionary updated his definition of the word ""preference"" to indicate that the term sexual preference is quote ""offensive.""  In other words Mazie Hirono truly the slowest person to hold public office in the history of this country is now in control of our dictionary.  Is that good news or bad news? Hard to know it's definitely not good news for Democrats many of whom made that very public slur.  Just until the other day Joe Biden for example must be canceled now.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  J. BIDEN:  Rebuild the backbone of this country middle class but this time bring everybody along regardless of color sexual preference and their backgrounds.  Because the President has become so divisive in terms of everything he has done based on race sexual preference or just across the board.  I did not think we should discriminate against people based on their sexual preference.  Allowing anyone to be in the military regardless of their sexual orientation or preference.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON:  Oh sexual preference. The Democrats wants you to know it can't be a preference. Your sexual desires can't be voluntary. They're inborn. They're mandatory. You must go with nature.  This is the only subject on which they're on nature's side amazingly. And now the dictionary agrees with them.  But Biden is not the only one to use the wrong words. It turns out according to Mazie Hirono Ruth Bader Ginsburg herself was a bigot. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  RUTH BADER GINSBURG U.S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE:  Society has come to respect people whatever their sexual preference.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON:  Oh we're going to have to rethink her sainthood. Mazie Hirono wants to assure you however that this is a problem we're fighting and if you don't understand that you're probably dumb.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  HIRONO:  One of the things that we Democrats have a really hard time is connecting to people's hearts instead of here. We have a really hard time doing that and one of the reasons that that was told to me at one of our retreats was that we Democrats know so much. That is true. And we have to kind of tell everybody how smart we are.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON:  The ultimate triumph of self-esteem Mazie Hirono considers herself an intellectual. It's just all too great.  Douglas Murray isn't from this country so he can laugh at it. He is one of the smartest people to write in our language. He is the author of the book which if you hadn't read you should called ""The Madness of Crowds: Gender Race and Identity."" We're happy to have Douglas Murray on with us tonight.  Douglas Murray great to see you.  DOUGLAS MURRAY AUTHOR ""THE MADNESS OF CROWDS"":  Good to be with you.  CARLSON:  What is this about exactly? Sexual preference now not an acceptable term?  MURRAY:  Yes. Well what's most disorientating about this of course is that we know the whole Democratic playbook on this and it's so dull and boring isn't it?  I mean --  CARLSON:  Yes.  MURRAY:  Totally predictable how the radical left are going to behave. If Amy Coney Barrett had been a man we know that by now the Democratic left would have been saying that she was a misogynist. They would probably have tried to research whether she had ever drunk beer in the late 20th Century.  And if she hadn't have adopted two black children and loved them and cared for them as her own they would have been trying the racist one by now. But they couldn't try either of those so they had one other shot in their gun and that was to say that she is some kind of homophobe. That's the other remaining accusation they've got.  And they're doing it on the basis as you say of a term which everybody used until yesterday. In fact the advocate which is a sort of legacy gay magazine in America probably the main gay magazine such as it exists anymore used the term sexual preference just three weeks ago.  So there is nothing sincere in this as there is nothing sincere in all of these accusations that the radical left likes to use. They just weaponize them to try to win.  CARLSON:  So why did we take it seriously? Why do we fall for it every single time? Why do we respond at all?  Well one reason all of this ties up doesn't it. You mentioned Jack and Twitter earlier. You know Twitter put this story at the very head of Twitter today. It said it was the number one most important subject on the planet.  We have Senator Hirono leading the charge to stop people using words that everyone used until yesterday. And this is the thing we're being manipulated apart from anything else.  CARLSON:  Yes that's right.  MURRAY:  Not just by radical leftists but by Big Tech that tells us we've all got to be incredibly aggrieved at the same things that deeply grieve she pretends Senator Hirono.  CARLSON:  Such a smart point. Douglas Murray always a great pleasure to have you on our show and in our country. Great to see you.  MURRAY:  Great pleasure.  CARLSON:  Thank you.  Well you might have seen a startling video the Speaker of the House on another channel she appeared to forget she was on air and treated the anchor like he ran a hair salon. It's revealing. You'll like it.  Plus we are keeping an eye on the President who is in Des Moines Iowa tonight. We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  CARLSON:  Well you may have seen the clips on another channel an anchor doing what no anchor is allowed to do asking Nancy Pelosi a question and then pushing for an answer. The question was why are you blocking coronavirus relief spending? Here is how the Speaker of the House responded.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  WOLF BLITZER CNN HOST:  Make a deal put the ball in McConnell's court. So what do you say to Ro Khanna?  REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  What I say to you is I don't know why you're always an apologist and many of your colleagues apologists for the Republican position.  What makes me amused if it weren't so sad is how you all think that you know more about the suffering of the American people than those of us who are elected by them.  BLITZER:  It's not about me it's about millions of Americans who can't put food on the table who can't pay their rent who are having trouble --  PELOSI:  And we represent them.  BLITZER:  Who are in trouble getting by.  PELOSI:  And we represent them.  BLITZER:   ... every day is critically critically important.  Thanks so much for joining us.  PELOSI:  Thank you for sensitivity to our constituents' needs.  BLITZER:  I am sensitive to them because I see them on the street begging for food begging for money. Madam Speaker thank you so much.  PELOSI:  Have you fed them. We feed them.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON:  We feed them. We throw the food over our fence in Napa and they gratefully clamber up and eat it like squirrels. That's how Nancy Pelosi feels about you. She is feeding you. You owe everything to Nancy Pelosi.  If you feel that way you can see why you'd be a little short tempered if some ungrateful plebe tries to ask you a real question. Anyone who does must be a secret right-wing operative. Here she was in August making the same point.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JUDY WOODRUFF PBS ANCHOR:  Democrats want more money Republicans want a lot less. They are saying they're willing to show flexibility and they are also saying a lot of the money that was passed in the spring Madam Speaker has not even been spent yet.  PELOSI:  Well if you want to be an advocate for them -- if you want to be an advocate for them --  WOODRUFF:  No I am --  PELOSI:  Let's see what the facts are.  WOODRUFF:  I'm playing devil's advocate here.  PELOSI:  No no --  WOODRUFF:  I am asking you for your position.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON:  Nancy Pelosi is convinced a lot of liberal reporters are secretly right wing and probably white supremacists actually. What's going on here exactly with her?  Mark Steyn is our expert on deep seated issues. We're happy to have him on tonight. Mark what is this?  MARK STEYN AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST:  Well I'd like to when feeding time for Nancy Pelosi's constituents is because I'd like to go to San Francisco and see that. All of the zoos are closed at the moment. That'll be about the only entertainment left.  And the idea of Wolf Blitzer as somehow this shill for the Trump administration I also find -- it's LBJ's famous line that if he'd lost Walter Cronkite he'd lost the country.  For poor old Nancy Pelosi if she has lost Wolf Blitzer she has lost the last seven people at Gate 28 at LaGuardia with no cell phones and only CNN to watch. I mean it is an extraordinary moment.  What your show has been about the theme of this show tonight from top to bottom whether we're talking about this judicial hearing whether we're talking about the Facebook Twitter; whether we're talking about Mazie Hirono's sexual preference for not hearing the word sexual preference. What they're all about is about -- don't laugh. Don't laugh Tucker.  My sexual preference is to hear Joe Biden woozily staggering around saying the words sexual preference. While Mazie Hirono whips me with the new edition of Webster's dictionary. That's a small niche demographic but that's the one I belong to.  CARLSON:  Oh that's dirty.  STEYN:  Sorry I don't usually wear blue this early in the evening Tucker.  But anyway anyway. But what they all have in common is actually what Nancy Pelosi said to Wolf you don't know enough to ask me about the bill. The bill is prepared by as she put it my chairs by which means the chairman of these committees whose staffers whose staffers whose staffers whose staffers write the bills and nobody knows what's in them until they've been passed.  And then we have this absurd spectacle the whole country has to come to a halt over the appointment of a judge a judge's Republic is a contradiction in terms. The framers would have been horrified. They would have been even more horrified by the furniture in the room where physically the senators have to be 12 feet higher than the level at which the witnesses sit in.  I testified at the Senate. I got a crick in my neck looking up at Corey Booker to see what he was mocking me for. I testified in the Canadian Parliament last year and what do you know in the House of Commons in Ottawa they put the legislators on the same level.  Nancy Pelosi embodies the gulf that's widened up between the political class and the citizenry. And that condescension to Wolf embodies it.  CARLSON:  It's a very deep point a judge's Republic is a contradiction in terms boy.  STEYN:  Absolutely.  CARLSON:  Amen. Mark Steyn. Thank you.  STEYN:  Thanks a lot Tucker.  CARLSON:  So the schools are completely out of control and if you have kids in them you know that. We want to highlight one specific case tonight because it speaks for what's happening in so many different places.  A 17-year-old student investigated and harassed by the school her parents pay a lot to send her too to tonight for posting completely ordinary conservative views on social media accounts. It's happening at Episcopal High School in Alexandria Virginia.  We're going to talk to her attorney after the break.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  CARLSON:  Episcopal High School in Alexandria Virginia has a long more than 150-year long history. It's an impressive school one of the best in the country. A lot of impressive people have gone there. But like so many schools it's becoming a woke factory thanks to its leadership bad leadership.  Now a 17-year-old student at that school is facing harassment from the school from her teachers for posting positive conservative content on social media pretty moderate stuff. To give just one example in a direct message on Instagram a teacher dismissed this student and we call her by her first name Mackenzie with a slur and nasty slur too a little blank.  According to Mackenzie's attorney Jesse Binnall the school is planning on hauling the girl before a disciplinary committee for the crime of having divergent views.  Jesse Binnall joins us tonight. Jesse thanks so much for coming on. So it this is an outrage on its face. But it's also representative of so much that's going on in the country right now. But I'd love to get granular quickly on what she did wrong.  JESSE BINNALL LAWYER FOR EPISCOPAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT:  Thanks Tucker and it really is outrageous because what she did wrong the only thing that they can really point to that she did wrong is point -- is have mainstream conservative content on her Instagram account. It is something that she shared from mainstream sources like Turning Point USA and Prager University stuff that we see every day that's very normal for someone who believes in conservative principles to have.  And the school went crazy. In fact what's really incredible is what started all this was that she decided to post sympathies for the family of David Dorn a retired police officer who was killed by rioters and her classmates went crazy and started attacking her body shaming her. They attacked her for a prior interracial relationship that she was in.  They absolutely were just vile and it wasn't even as you pointed out it wasn't even just students. It was an alum of the school and it was a teacher at the school. And now we're in this spot where they've decided to use a woke phrase they're going to victim shame. And they've decided instead of holding her attackers to account they're going to haul McKinsey right before a Disciplinary Committee where they are not going to tell her exactly when it's going to be. It's really incredible.  CARLSON:  It's unbelievable. These schools are extremely expensive and if they to keep this up they will go out of business. This cannot continue. People will not send their kids to places like this. Unfortunately it was a great school.  Jesse I'm glad that her family has hired you and Godspeed.  BINNALL:  Thank you so much Tucker.  CARLSON:  We are out of time. We'll be back tomorrow 8:00 p.m.  Sean Hannity now. A man who has been on this treasonous story for a long time. Great to see you Sean.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC.

305,Tucker Carlson responds to CDC over his critique of face masks, A federal appeals court on Friday upheld a Kentucky law requiring abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic.  A divided panel of appellate judges reinstated a rule requiring the clinics to have a written agreement with an area hospital and ambulance service in case of emergencies in order to operate. Written transfer agreements have been required in the state for more than two decades and are meant as a way to ensure patients who experience complications can be moved to a hospital immediately. But changes to regulations in 2017 made it harder for abortion providers to obtain such agreements leaving EMW Women’s Surgical Center PSC in Louisville – the only provider of abortions in the state at the time – without a license. MORE THAN 100 UNDELIVERED BALLOTS FOUND IN KENTUCKY DUMPSTER  The 2-1 ruling from the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reverses a 2018 district court ruling that found the law first passed in 1998 violated constitutionally protect due process right.  EMW Women’s Surgical Center first challenged the law in 2017 after a licensing fight with then-Gov. Matt Bevin.  Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky later joined the suit claiming Bevin had used transfer agreements to block the clinic’s license to provide abortions.  KENTUCKY GOV. BESHEAR QUARANTINING AFTER MEMBER OF HIS SECURITY TEAM TESTED POSITIVE  Two clinics have since been allowed to provide abortions after Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear who supports abortion rights took office in late 2019. In Friday’s ruling the appeals court said the “district court erred in concluding that Kentucky would be left without an abortion facility.” The appeals court rejected the clinics’ argument their facilities were in jeopardy of closing because the Kentucky law allows clinics to apply for a 90-day waiver if they are denied a licensing agreement which they could theoretically reapply for each quarter and continue to operate.  “(We) must presume that the Inspector General will consider waiver applications in good faith and will not act ‘simply to make it more difficult for (women) to obtain an abortion’” the ruling stated. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron praised the court’s decision.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “The Sixth Circuit’s ruling keeps in place an important Kentucky law for protecting the health and safety of patients by finding that Planned Parenthood and EMW failed to prove that they could not comply with the statute and regulation” Cameron said in a statement. , https://www.foxnews.com/politics/appeals-court-upholds-kentucky-abortion-restrictions,0.8103396426936865

SEAN HANNITY FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome to HANNITY. We begin with the FOX News alert. President Trump holding another massive rally as he continues to -- well like the Energizer Bunny crisscross country into every swing state. Meanwhile back in the swamp in Washington D.C. another big day on Capitol Hill as Judge Amy Coney Barrett ACB as they call her continues to impress. And with just 20 days left until you are the ultimate jury and it's Election Day Joe Biden -- he called the lid on campaign activities early this morning after a disastrous two days on the campaign trail. Also tonight we will discuss what is an avalanche of damning information surrounding Biden's adult son zero experience Hunter and the corrupt practices of the Biden family business. But first let's take a step back and listen to what Joe Biden repeatedly said about his knowledge and involvement as it relates to his son's international business dealings. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPORTER:  Mr. Vice President how many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings? JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I have never spoken with my son about his overseas business dealings. I have never discussed with my son or my brother or anyone else anything having to do with their businesses period. And what I will do is the same thing we did in our administration. It will be an absolute wall between personal and private and the government. REPORTER:  Do you stand by your statement that you did not discuss any of your son's overseas visits? BIDEN:  Yes I stand by that statement. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY:  Yeah well what you just watched is Biden lying straight to your face. He does it over and over again. Here are the facts: According to the U.S. Senate report from Senator Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley first in December of 2013 Hunter Biden flew with his aboard Air Force Two. They took a trip to China. Hunter admittedly met with Chinese businessmen during the trip and of course prior to the you know trip on Air force Two Hunter had zero experience in the country of China zero experience with Chinese investments. But only ten days later as our friend Peter Schweizer pointed out in ""Secret Empires"" Hunter signed on to a very lucrative sweetheart deal with the Chinese state-backed investment fund netting Hunter a massive amount of money and equity and revenue in partnership with the Bank of China. Now later then Hunter opened up a joint bank account with Chinese nationals connected to the China's communist party. That bank account would fund a shopping spree for the entire family and Hunter. And then on February 2014 Hunter -- well he got a $3.5 million wire transfer from a corrupt Russian oligarch once referred to as the first lady of Moscow. Again zero experience Hunter no experience in the country of Russia. Then on April 22nd 2014 a Kazakh oligarch wired over 140 grand to Hunter Biden's firm. The money was earmarked for a new car. Again Hunter has zero experience in the country of Kazakhstan. And meanwhile only a few days later in May of 2014 Hunter began receiving massive monthly payouts from this Ukrainian oil and gas client called Burisma Holdings that we talked so much about. The company was owned by a pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch. Once again Hunter zero experience in the Ukraine zero experience in oil gas but was paid millions of dollars. Don't take my word for it. You can listen to Hunter in his words in that was now an infamous and disastrous interview on ""Good Morning America."" Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HUNTER BIDEN SON OF JOE BIDEN:  There's been a lot of misinformation about me not about my dad. Nobody buys that buys this idea that I was unqualified to be on the board. INTERVIEWER:  What were your qualifications to be on the board of Burisma? HUNTER BIDEN:  Well I was vice chairman of the board of Amtrak for five years. I was a chairman of the board of the U.N. World Food Programme. I was a lawyer for Boies Schiller Flexner one of the most prestigious law firms in the world. INTERVIEWER:  You didn't have any extensive knowledge about natural gas or Ukraine itself though. HUNTER BIDEN:  No but I think I had as much knowledge as anybody else that was in the board if not more. INTERVIEWER:  In the list you gave of the reasons why you're on that board you did not list the fact that you were the son of the vice president. HUNTER BIDEN:  Of course yeah no I --  INTERVIEWER:  What role do you think that played? HUNTER BIDEN:  I think that it is possible for me to be on any of the boards that I just mentioned without saying I'm the son of the president of the United States. INTERVIEWER:  If your last name wasn't Biden do you think it would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? HUNTER BIDEN:  I don't know I don't know. Probably not. I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life that if my last name wasn't Biden. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY:  Joe Biden he probably just missed that interview because a few months later Joe Biden had this to say when asked about zero experience Hunter and his lucrative business dealings. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) INTERVIEWER:  Do you think it was wrong for him to take that position --  JOE BIDEN:  No. INTEVIEWER:  -- knowing that it was really because that company wanted access to you? JOE BIDEN:  Well that's not true. You are saying things you do not know you are talking about. No one said that. Who said that? Who said that? INTERVIEWER:  Don't you think that -- don't you think that it's just one of those things where people think well that seems kind of sleazy? Why would he have that job if not for who his father was? JOE BIDEN:  He's a very bright guy. INTERVIEWER:  I guess the question I'm kind of asking is was it right? JOE BIDEN:  It's appearance it's appearance. INTERVIEWER:  Yeah. JOE BIDEN:  Yeah. Well he said he regretted having done it. INTERVIEWER:  Yeah. JOE BIDEN:  Speak for himself. He's a grown man. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY:  All right. Despite what you just heard from Joe Biden not only was Hunter clearly fiddling influence but it likely paid off for at least of his clients. While Hunter was gainfully employed by Burisma Holdings then Vice President Biden remember he leveraged a billion of your U.S. tax dollars and a loan guarantee to force the country of the Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma for corruption. How do we know this? Because Joe Biden was bragging about it on tape. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN:  We're not going to give you the billion dollars. They said you have no authority. You're not the president the president said -- I said call him. I said I'm telling you you're not getting the billion dollars. I said you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here -- I think it was what six hours? I said I'm leaving in six hours and if the prosecutor is not fired you're not getting the money. Well son of a (EXPLETIVE DELETED) he got fired. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY:  Well son of a B he got fired. Quid and a pro and a quo and his zero-experienced son he makes millions. Great deal. A massive conflict of interest State Department officials in the Obama administration were openly worrying about how Hunter was affecting U.S. policy on the world stage. They also worried about potential extortion concerns. Here with more is Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson. Senator thank you for being with us. OK I want to break this down because we're talking not only about no experience in Ukraine oil gas energy at all. No experience with China no experience in private equity that I can find. Maybe you did I haven't been able to find it. No experience with Russia Kazakhstan or Ukraine. And how much money are we talking about here? SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI):  Well we're talking millions. But Sean isn't it pretty obvious? What Hunter Biden had going for him was his last name and he traded that last name as did other members of Biden family to make millions of dollars. You know $4.2 million from Burisma $3.5 million transferred from the former wife of the now deceased former mayor of Moscow. The intricate web the vast web of financial connections and money cash flowing back and forth between Hunter and his businesses and Chinese nationals that have the connections to the Chinese Communist Party as well as People Liberation Army as well. So this is very troubling what. What astounds me is how the press continues to ignore this. You know we issued our report and the press just ignored it. They said well there's nothing illegal here. Well it's not my job to prove illegality. My job is to do oversight get information to inform public policy but also to inform the public. We gave the press we gave the public a treasure trove of information that is very troubling that is just crying to be investigated and I think what we're starting to see now is the dams breaking. People are coming forward with more information and that's what's going to be required. HANNITY:  OK I look at Putin and Russia -- hostile actor hostile regime. Same with Ukraine. We know about the DNC operative that went to the Ukrainian embassy. This was reported in January of 2017. The bottom line is there are countries that do want to influence elections. Now in spite of a media narrative that was about Trump-Russia collusion that is debunked we learned that there was a Russian disinformation dossier in the last election. Hillary Clinton paid for it. We know that they were warned repeatedly not to trust it. We know that the source for Christopher Steele was known to the FBI to be a Russian operative for over a decade and they still use that dirty Russian misinformation dossier to secure FISA warrants to spy on the Trump campaign and the Trump presidency. OK it was the opposite of what the media said. How deep do these countries go in trying to influence our elections? And do you think there's more shenanigans that they're now playing to try and influence this election? JOHNSON:  Well I think Russia always has. I mean China has Iran is. We need to keep our guard up there's no doubt about it. But when you engage in such an obvious and glaring conflict of interest in Ukraine then in Russia then in China you're just asking for trouble. I mean this -- this represents such an enormous conflict of interest counterintelligence and extortion threat just what we already know and Sean I think we're just scratching the surface. And I think what we're also seeing is you know Chuck Grassley and Mike Lee's investigation you know it's kind of broken down. You got Ukraine. You got the Bidens who put themselves in the middle of that investigation. Then we have the corruption of the FBI Department of Justice under Obama the corruption the transition process of that corrupt investigation special counsel it's all coming together. For example Devon Archer Hunter Biden's business partner was convicted - - his conviction was overturned by a judge who just happens to be the wife of the lead prosecutor of the Paul Manafort case was part of Robert Mueller's special counsel team. You know this whistleblower who by the way contacted us the day after we issued our report that the news media completely ignored he contacted us but he also apparently delivered this computer to the FBI. What did they do with it? What did they do with it? Are we seeing different levels of justice one for Democrats versus one for Republicans one for the one system of justice for the well-connected and one for the rest of Americans? I think this is what is coming together. We're seeing a very corrupt process here. HANNITY:  I cannot independently corroborate all of this new information that keeps coming out and I have a hard time trusting information that comes out of a lot of these countries that we know there are high levels of corruption within the upper ranks of their governments. Do you feel the same way or am I just being paranoid? JOHNSON:  No listen I take everything that our committee receives everything I hear with a huge grain of salt particularly when it's coming from countries like Ukraine that have a history of corruption and disinformation. But you know the same thing this whistleblower. You know the only reason I'm talking about this whistleblower is this whistleblower has gone public. So I've announced that yes he contacted us the day after we issued our report. We have talked to him but we're in the process of validating his claims. We take it all as a grain salt. Obviously ""The New York Post"" feels strongly enough that they actually want (ph) the story. We were trying to validate the claims. HANNITY:  Right. All right. Is Donald Trump going to win the state of Wisconsin? JOHNSON:  Boy based on the enthusiasm of the supporters absolutely. We've got a great ground game here. Joe Biden by and large has been absent. They basically just have a social media campaign. They don't have very many boots on the ground. And based on his record alone President Trump ought to win Wisconsin easily. He came in helped save Kenosha from the riots by providing the added manpower to quell those riots. So I think President Trump's got a really good chance here in Wisconsin. HANNITY:  All right Senator great to see you. Thank you for all the hard work you're doing. Getting to the bottom of these things is not easy. Now today as new allegations surrounding the Biden family business started to gain a lot of traction big tech company they raced into the rescue of the ever failing Joe Biden Facebook limiting distribution Twitter tried to censor all of it all together actually blocking users like Kayleigh McEnany will join us later from posting or messaging a story. Of course anyone is free to still share garbage fake news articles about the debunked Russian dossier or any other anti-Trump hoax or conspiracy theory that we've been fed through the last three and a half years. Twitter and Facebook never censored fake news that smears the president or smears conservatives or Republicans but it is clear big tech along with the media mob they're doing everything and anything in their power to get the very weak the very frail the very cognitively struggling Joe Biden across the finish line. And now they're actually predicting a big win for Joe Biden. They highlight one poll after another after another. They look almost identical to 2016 showing Biden lead him by a massive margin. But guess what? We know what happened in 2016 and many of these battleground states like Wisconsin Pennsylvania Michigan the polls were off by a few important and significant percentage points and that's all it took. President Trump not Hillary Clinton became the 45th president of the United States. But let's be clear the president won these states with razor thin margins. Your vote matters. Trump won by less than one percent in Wisconsin. And in Pennsylvania he only won by 0.7 percent. The president won Michigan by only 0.3 percent. My advice don't believe the polls don't be discouraged. But also don't take anything for granted. And I do advise this I advise people that ask me -- to believe you are behind in the polls and that your vote will matter and you do your part. That's all we can all do. As I've said many times this will be and is the most pivotal election in our lifetime. Democrats they don't just want to raise taxes and increase regulation in the New Green Deal the radical socialist party would like to fundamentally eliminate capitalism transform our American system into something that would be unrecognizable to what we have today. They would control the Supreme Court. They're basically all but telegraphing they will be court packing if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are ever elected. They want to control the legislative branch. They want to add senators with D.C. statehood and elsewhere. They want to control lawmaking by ending the legislative filibuster if they are successful add amnesty to the list. Then they will ram their entire radical socialist agenda down the throats of everybody in this country whether or not you like it or not. Now vote like your country depends on it because I would argue it does. Here with more FOX News contributor Dan Bongino ""FOX and Friends"" weekend co-host Pete Hegseth. You know it's eerily identical to 2016 Dan Bongino in terms of the polls in terms of the media coverage in terms of the confidence but also in terms of enthusiasm for the president. DAN BONGINO FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yeah. You know Sean I ran in that election so I have some personal experience here in the swing state of Florida for Congress. HANNITY:  I tried to help you. BONGINO:  Yeah you did. I didn't listen politics is not my thing. I think that's obvious this way. Talking about it is doing it not so much. I'm actually glad I lost given all the sleaze balls we see up there. I don't want to be associated with that group. I'd much rather be with this panel here. But here's the thing there was this phenomenon. I used to get these walk lists that I saw. These walk lists would be for four by four Republican voters -- in other words Republican voters who voted in the last four primaries and last four because it was a heavy Republican district last four generals. And you the walk list I'd go knock I like knocking on doors it was my thing I think it's one of the better ways to you know to campaign. And I would walk past all these houses with Trump signs on them that weren't on the list. And I called my campaign manager complaining one day true story I said why are you wasting my time? This list stinks. You're missing all these Trump voters who are Republicans. She said Dan they've never voted before. Go knock on the door and check. Our list is -- our list is fine. I did it and you know what Sean she was right. Everyone told me this is the first time I'm going to vote. And I can guarantee you that's why those polls were off then and that's why they're probably off now. HANNITY:  All right Pete but my -- I use the football analogy in that all right it's the fourth quarter. You got two minutes left. You have no timeouts. You're on your own 20. You got to march down the field. You got to go 80 yards cross the plane kick the extra point to win. I have that kind of urgency every minute of my life but some people don't but I do believe it could be that close. PETE HEGSETH FOX NEWS CO-HOST ""FOX &amp; FRIENDS WEEKEND"":  Yes in that analogy though what the social media companies and everyone else in the so-called elite media left-wing media is trying to do they took away your timeouts. They've deflated the ball and they've sent the coach to the locker room and you still have to go those 80 yards. That's exactly how it works. HANNITY:  That -- by the way that's a great point. That is a great point. HEGSETH:  That's what they do. They rigged -- by the way the reason why they're suppressing this ""New York Post"" article is because it's a hacked materials policy is what Twitter is saying what about the hacked tax returns of President Trump that were allowed to be --  HANNITY:  Great point too. HEGSETH:  -- proliferated as far and wide as anyone wanted. There's a double -- if the left didn't have double standards they'd have no standards at all. This is how they operate. All of these social media company companies operate this way. I think this story sticks Sean because the business of America is business. People elected a business owner in 2016 Donald Trump and his family got rich and made money before they went into government and then they went in with a business mindset. That's why they're saying open up lockdowns in perpetuity can't work it crushes small business. The business of Biden Joe and Hunter is the business of government. They went into government and got rich because of it and this is only validating what people already understand. We know that -- we know the entire media system social media system is rigged against us. That's why the polls are wrong. You got to get out. My ballot -- I'm -- in New Jersey they push the ballot to us. There's no way I'm sending that in the mail. I drove to the through the elections and handed it to somebody because you can't trust anybody in this process unless you do it yourself. HANNITY:  You know it is pretty amazing and they want to change the laws in the final days of the campaign. One f the things though the Democrats lie. And right now one of the big lies -- and I hate when they do this to older Americans and Dan they're telling older Americans that Donald Trump is not is going to take away health coverage for pre-existing conditions it is a lie. They are lying and telling the elderly in this country Donald Trump is going to take away your Medicare. That is an absolute lie. They do it. They use the same divisive tactics every two years and every four years. Republicans are racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamophobic. They want dirty air and water and they want to take grandma in a wheelchair and throw her over a cliff and they want her to die. They're now scaring grandma and grandpa again and they lie every two and four years. BONGINIO:  Yeah you know who I blame more -- you're right Sean. I mean it's obvious saying Democrats lie is like saying you know water's wet you're like yeah of course that's what they do. They're really good. They're like expert. On the top of the totem pole of skills at the top for every Democrat is you're a really skilled liar you're really fantastic at it. That's what they have to do. I mean they tell you things that are just on their face ridiculous. You know the same government who can't get you a driver's license at the DMV is going to run healthcare and crack open your chest and all the suckers out there like yeah really? Because they think like Neanderthals. You have to be an idiot. I mean you really have to be a moron to be a Democrat these days. I'm really sorry. I don't mean to be rude. I'm not talking about voting Democrats. A lot of my friends --  (CROSSTALK) BONGINO:  I'm talking about --  HANNITY:  Old people watch these commercials they're inundated. Donald Trump is going to kill you. Don't vote for Donald Trump. BONGINO:  That was my point. If it wasn't for the media the Democrat Party wouldn't exist. HANNITY:  Last word Pete. HEGSETH:  And when the police don't show up when the police won't show up that ultimately could kill you and that -- and people see their own personal security as more real than this garbage about pushing granny off the cliff. HANNITY:  All right. Thank you both. When we come back Lawrence Jones -- he's our 2020 correspondent on the ground. He's in Iowa tonight. He spoke with many of the Trump supporters that were outside the president's rally tonight. He has a live report. Also Judge ACB Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing continued today. Democrats continue their attacks against the character. Senator Lindsey Graham he has been running the proceedings. He will join us live with an update and much more. A lot of news on this breaking news night on HANNITY. Thanks for being with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY:  All right. Only 20 days to go until Election Day. You are the ultimate jury. The president is hitting the campaign trail wrapping up another massive rally tonight in Des Moines Iowa where our very own Lawrence Jones our 2020 correspondent investigative reporter on the ground. LJ -- oh look he's got his motorcycle jacket on. Really? Really -- did you -- were you driving around the yellow little chilling LJ bike LJ Harley or what? LAWRENCE JONES FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's a little chilly. It's a little chilly out here Sean. HANNITY:  I'm -- I admire your job. I want to switch roles. (LAUGHTER) HANNITY:  What's going on in Iowa? JONES:  Good evening Sean. Yes Sean earlier today this was day three as you know of confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Barrett and the Democrats gave her all that they could not letting up but she stood there and she took every single hit punching back with no notes. I talked with voters today Trump supporters today and they say that she can take it and she doesn't need any help and she would ultimately be confirmed. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JONES:  Judge Barrett she wants to be on the Supreme Court. She's going through a tough hearing right now. Do you think she's been treated fairly? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No however she's holding her own and she's doing a great job. So we're real proud of her. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She is so amazing it's like they can't they keep trying to trip her up and they just can't. I mean she -- I've never seen anybody like it. JONES:  Are you impressed with her? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I am and she's making all these Democrats look really stupid. Just makes me so happy. JONES:  You seem happy. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah I am. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think that she has an intellect like no other probably one of the smartest people that's ever going to come into the Supreme Court. So I don't really think she's fazed by any of the questions she was asked. JONES:  What do you think happens at the end of the day? Do you think she gets confirmed? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Absolutely absolutely. And you know what? I think if some of the Democratic senators don't vote for her then they're -- then they don't need to be reelected because how can they look at her and think she's not qualified? (END VIDEO CLIP) JONES:  Sean in a new Morning Consult poll 48 percent of voters believe that she should be confirmed 31 percent believe that she shouldn't. That's a 17-point margin Sean and it's also up two points since last week. Back to you in New York. HANNITY:  Well do you get amazed every day the size of the crowds at all these rallies? It's pretty amazing. JONES:  I keep telling you Sean I haven't seen this amount of energy until before the former president President Barack Obama ran when he had his rallies. And I think that indication of where voters are going right now. He won that election and I think just judging by the people that I see every single day at these Trump events that the president is on his way to a path to victory. When I go to Joe Biden rallies I see more Trump supporters there .So I think that's an indication. (LAUGHTER) HANNITY:  All right. You got -- you got the best job on the HANNITY show. There's no doubt about it. Great reporting as always. JONES:  The people want to see you out here too though Sean. HANNITY:  Oh yeah they do I'm sure. But we got to get you on Air Force One and make your life a lot easier you know because you end up going to the same spot. We'll find a place on Air Force One for you. All right LJ thank you. All right. Today was day three of Judge Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings. Democrats they tried once again to go after her character. Once again Judge Barrett unflappable. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN):  I know you're aware now but were you aware back then? JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NOMINEE:  Well --  KLOBUCHAR:  -- when you were nominee. BARRETT:  Well Senator Klobuchar I think that the Republicans have kind of made that clear it's just been part of the public discourse. KLOBUCHAR:  OK but it -- just -- it is the answer yes then that you were - -  BARRETT:  Well Senator all these questions you're suggesting that I have animus or that I cut a deal with the president and I was very clear yesterday that that isn't what happened. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE):  I'm just getting at how closely you would ally yourself with Justice Scalia's jurisprudence. Would you agree with Justice Scalia that Justice Ginsburg's decision in VMI was wrong? BARRETT:  I've already said you know and I hope that you aren't suggesting that I don't have my own mind or that I couldn't think independently or that I would just decide like let me see what Justice Scalia has said about this in the past because I assure you I have my own mind. SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Do you accept that COVID-19 is infectious? Do you accept that smoking causes cancer? BARRETT:  Senator again I was wondering where you were going with that. You have asked me a series of questions like -- that are completely uncontroversial like whether COVID-19 is infectious whether smoking causes cancer and then trying to analogize that to eliciting an opinion on me that is a very contentious matter -- opinion from me that is on a very contentious matter of public debate and I will not do that. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY:  I mean where do these questions come from? Here with reaction Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham. All right Senator. I don't know. I -- I give you a lot of credit. You have the patience of Job dealing with this. I was beyond impressed --  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  Thank you. HANNITY:  Amazingly unflappable no notes as we all watched these answers. I mean Brown versus Board of Education. Plessy Ferguson. I mean she's rolling through one landmark Supreme Court case after another. And I saw the vitriol and the anger that they had in the Kavanaugh hearings but they didn't have that that one track to go down it seems. GRAHAM:  Well number one this hearing was far different than Kavanaugh. She's one of the most qualified people to ever be nominated in the Supreme Court in the history of the court. She was unflappable. Amy Barrett is an amazing human being wide in deep knowledge of the law judicial temperament that you would hope for in any judge anywhere impeccable character. They couldn't lay a glove on her in terms of qualification. There was a lot of feeble attempts to kind of marginalize her. None of those blows landed. I'm very proud of Judge Amy Barrett. She's headed to the Supreme Court. And let me tell you why this is important -- to every conservative young woman out there wondering if there's a place for you at the table in the Supreme Court you dare be pro-life you dare embrace your religion Amy Barrett has broken a ceiling and you're going to be the beneficiary of this. She's going to the court. She deserves to go to the court and I was very proud of the committee the way it conducted itself. HANNITY:  All right. Let me ask you Senator. Let's talk about the process. Democrats want to slow this down. You have --  GRAHAM:  Sure. HANNITY:  Her testimony is now done. The Senate will do its job in committee first. GRAHAM:  Right. HANNITY:  Democrats have pledged to delay as much as they can. What do you expect and when will there be a final vote in the U.S. Senate? GRAHAM:  I expect one a hell of a fight tomorrow to try to stop me and my colleagues from voting her out of committee. What I'm going to do tomorrow is move the nomination for October the 22nd set a time certain so that we'll vote her out of committee October the 22nd then Mitch can take her to the floor. I think she'll be voted on a week before the election. But they'll try everything they can to stop this nomination in committee. It will fail. I appreciate my Democratic colleagues not going down the Kavanaugh road with Judge Barrett. She was challenged. She was tested. She passed with flying colors. But all I can say is that Democrats are putting a lot of pressure -- the base is putting a lot of pressure on Democratic senators to stop this. They're raising money like crazy. I've had Amy Barrett's back I need you to have mine. My opponent outraised me 2-1.  But here's what I want to tell you viewers: We've come this far. We're not going to let Amy down. We're going to get across the line and our committee is ready to act tomorrow. HANNITY:  But they -- but they've been attacking all of you that are up for re-election. I mean they're attacking unfairly --  GRAHAM:  Yes. HANNITY:  -- Martha McSally. Joni Ernst they're attacking. Cory Gardner they're attacking. GRAHAM:  Yes right. HANNITY:  Mitch McConnell they've been attacking. Perdue in Georgia they've been attacking. Tillis in North Carolina they've been attacking. You know Democrats are claiming Joe Biden got $383 million. There is a hatred that I've never seen in all the years I've been doing this towards Donald Trump. Why do you think it is this bad? GRAHAM:  One they've never recognized that he is the president of the United States. They've tried to delegitimize his presidency. They've tried everything they can to destroy his presidency. It is not working. They hate my guts because I stood up for Kavanaugh when they tried to destroy that man's life and the unpardonable sin in politics has helped Donald Trump. My opponent has raised $57 million the most in the Senate in the history of the United States Senate because they want to take me out. To all people listening on this show you've been very generous --  (CROSSTALK) HANNITY:  I think it's great. I --  GRAHAM:  -- help every Republican. HANNITY:  Barbara Streisand is trying to get you thrown out of South Carolina and so I guess Rosie O'Donnell too right? GRAHAM:  Yeah you know I got to midnight let's pour it on let's show them that South Carolina's not for sale. But let me say this Sean this is a big historic moment for the -- for the young conservative women of the world. There is a place for you. Amy Barrett's going on the court. Don't be ashamed to be in pro-life. Embrace your faith. Embrace traditional family values. There's a place for you. We're making history. Thank you President Trump for nominating Judge Amy Barrett one of the most qualified people in the history of the country. Thank you President Trump. HANNITY:  You know and I feel sorry for her and her family and what they put her through the last three days but you ran a great proceeding and we look forward to the final vote. GRAHAM:  Thank you. HANNITY:  All right. Thank you Senator. GRAHAM:  Thank you. HANNITY:  When we come back. the mob and the media they refused to vet Joe Biden from the get-go. Now it appears Biden wants to stay in his basement as much as possible and hide. That is now the strategy run out the clock. We'll talk to White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany about that. Also Twitter just locked her account locked her out. Tammy Bruce Mercedes Schlapp and much more as we continue our reporting. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY:  All right. Kayleigh McEnany she will join us in a moment. But first now as Speaker Pelosi continues to hold up needed aid for American families. Well yesterday she was called out by CNN's Wolf Blitzer -- not to worry Nancy because today on ""The View"" Joy Behar the joyless one had your back. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOY BEHAR CO-HOST ""THE VIEW"":  And Wolf I love Wolf. Who doesn't love Wolf? We all love Wolf but he was out of line. He doesn't know what's going on behind closed doors. So Trump -- so we'll see calm down. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY:  One tough question Pelosi may be getting praise from joyless and her adoring fans in the mob. A new poll does find that most Americans blame Pelosi for the failure of Congress to pass yet another round of coronavirus relief. Here with reaction FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce along with senior advisor for Trump 2020 Mercedes Schlapp. OK. You know I guess I understand one tough question might be a little too much for Nancy Pelosi. Mercedes the big scandal that I see though and the biggest contributor to the -- to the Biden campaign and all things Democratic socialist the media. It's all hate Trump every second every hour of every day and Joe Biden has never had to answer any tough questions and they protect the fact that he's weak frail and obviously struggling cognitively. MERCEDES SCHLAPP TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISOR:  Yeah and let's remember his lit the lid they put on today from the Joe Biden campaign I believe it was probably like 9:45 a.m. Sean. So there's no --  HANNITY:  It was time for -- it was time for his nappy. It was nappy time. SCHLAPP:  Yeah yeah. Well let's remember that these town halls that they've had the NBC town hall it was filled with quote/unquote undecided voters which we know for a fact that many of them were favoring Joe Biden from the beginning. So it's a lot of -- what I would call media fraud coming from these outlets because at the end of the day their hatred towards Donald Trump -- this Trump derangement syndrome the fact that they're so focused on promoting this leftist agenda it's why you have the media outlets like CNN that didn't barely cover Amy Coney Barrett's hearing today only when Kamala appeared to ask those ridiculous questions of her. So I think it's very much -- it's very telling right now that especially when we're seeing these corruption situation with Hunter Biden is the media really going to ask the tough questions to Joe Biden and get Joe Biden to admit the fact that he's been lying about this cover-up about not talking about these business dealings that Hunter is having with Ukraine and with China? Those are the serious questions that need to be asked. I just don't -- I don't -- I don't believe that the media is capable of doing that. HANNITY:  Yeah. Court-packing D.C. statehood ending the Electoral College amnesty I can't think of any moment in the campaign Tammy that he's been asked any of these questions. TAMMY BRUCE FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  No it's a classic example of groupthink. This is a dynamic that is very cult-like where it's not just that you don't ask questions but you protect the target. You make sure that the target's not asked questions is not challenged. And then what you see is what you saw with Nancy Pelosi where when somebody might step out of line a little bit and ask a question about why are you holding hostage the stimulus money from the American people then there's this panic because they're not used to having to answer questions. Now one has to wonder why would Wolf Blitzer actually step out of line for a moment when he really doesn't? And I think it's because they recognize they saw the poll perhaps that you noted that Trump in fact is not being blamed. You know they're willing to throw the Americans into their volcano if they think that Donald Trump's going to be blamed for it. They don't care the real impact on the American people. But when they see that it might not be working as planned maybe Wolf Blitzer was actually trying to do the Democrats a favor and jar her out of this this state that she's in because the bottom line is also the way that the Congress has viewed their approval rating far below Donald Trump. So Americans don't trust her. Naturally they're not trusting Congress in general but when President Trump has spoken and when he has promised something he's come through. So he needs to remind people that this is Pelosi's fault. It's the Democrats playing politics and holding hostage their relief for something which are the lockdowns that the Democrats have also been perpetuating. It's the worst of everything you can imagine that the Democrats have brought to the table groupthink and holding money hostage using us like footballs throwing us into volcanoes. We are a speed bump in their vision and of course we have a chance to change that November and I hope we do. HANNITY:  It would be the most radical agenda of any major political party in history and a guy that is -- obviously he doesn't have the strength the stamina not even the mental alertness to be the president. Pretty frightening scenario. Thank you both. When we come back Kayleigh McEnany on Joe Biden's outrageous campaign strategy and Twitter temporary lock -- temporarily locking out her account. She'll tell us all about it as we continue. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY:  All right. We've been saying it for months the mainstream media mob refuses to do any vetting of Joe Biden. Now since the end of August he's taking fewer than half the questions that President Trump has taken from reporters. And with only 20 days before the election the Biden campaign strategy is now clear -- hide keep Joe hidden from the public -- we the people -- run of the clock ask no tough questions. Tonight White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany was locked out of her personal Twitter account after assuring that story that we mentioned earlier about Hunter Biden. She wasn't alone today. Twitter CEO @Jack Jack Dorsey is now admitting Twitter's actions on the article which were quote not great. You think Jack? Here with more White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Number one how are you feeling? You had your COVID diagnosis not fun I'm sure. How are you feeling now? KAYLEIGH MCENANY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I'm feeling great. No symptoms. So I can't complain. A lot of better of than (AUDIO GAP) HANNITY:  Yeah. Well I will say you are younger and healthy unlike me old person. I'm you know we are at greater risk which of course nobody likes for anybody. And hopefully with the new therapeutics and vaccine on the horizon that's all great. So you got locked out today. I really didn't understand from @Jack what he was trying to say because if you -- if you share a conspiracy -- you know the Russia-Trump conspiracy theory I don't remember people getting locked out for those lies that we now know they share then and even today still share. MCENANY:  Yeah that's exactly right. It made no sense what he said. And consider this Sean this was a news story with emails pictures of the emails which even the Biden campaign does not dispute the authenticity of the emails. They had a chance today they did not. But meanwhile (AUDIO GAP) story about President Trump in ""The Atlantic"" where you had more than 20 sources on the record disputing the content of the email. You have the ayatollah of Iran (AUDIO GAP) death to Israel and this is permitted on Twitter. But not an email that is reported by the way by FOX News' news division by ""The New York Post"" a credible outlet you are not allowed share that information. And make no mistake if they can ban the press secretary of the United States for President Trump they can ban (AUDIO GAP) citizen and that is pathetic. HANNITY:  That's a great point. Our own Adam Housley on his account has confirmed the authenticity of that as have other media outlets have been reporting on the story. I hear there is a lot more to come. Do you know what's coming? MCENANY:  I don't. It's not a temporary blockage. When I logged into my Twitter account it says I'm permanently banned. They essentially have me at gun point and unless (ph) you delete a news story reported by ""The New York Post"" I cannot regain access to my account. This is censorship. It is not the American way. This is not how a freedom- loving democracy operates. And we have to have to hold Twitter accountable and Facebook (ph) (AUDIO GAP) banning the transmission of the story simply because ideologically it hurts the side of the aisle that Silicon Valley prefers. It's sad. It's censorship. This is not America. HANNITY:  Yeah. Well you know it just -- the double standard is very clear. When Joe Biden -- when the president in a debate with Joe Biden brought up the first lady of Moscow and $3.5 million payment we had Senator Ron Johnson on earlier and he confirmed yeah that will happen just like the Russian oligarchs the Kazakh oligarchs the Russian nationals Kazakh nationals Ukrainian nationals Chinese nationals and all of these monies together. I mean this is the Biden family business while he is vice president. Imagine if the last name was Trump how do you think the mob and the media would be acting? MCENANY:  Oh it will be all over Twitter. Everyone would be reporting it. It will be the top news story. It would be the top trend on Twitter because there's one standard for Trump and another standard for anything on the other side of the aisle. But it's breathtaking that for a year really for at least more than a year Joe Biden told us I had nothing to do with Hunter's business dealings and today we get an email that says Hunter introducing Ukrainian oligarch to his father Joe Biden and that email is censored blacklisted erased from Twitter and Facebook and anyone who mentions it is banned from the public platform. HANNITY:  All right. Thanks Kayleigh. We wish you continued good health and a quick recovery -- as we would wish everybody. We'll continue. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY:  All right. Our 20-day countdown now. If you live in Florida Georgia North Carolina Ohio. If you live in Iowa Pennsylvania Michigan Wisconsin Minnesota if you live in Arizona Nevada if you live in the congressional district number two in Maine and New Hampshire well you will decide this election. You're the ultimate jury. Set your DVR. Never miss an episode. Let not your heart be troubled -- Laura Ingraham she will decide the next election whatever she says.

307,Sen. Johnson: 'Astounding' that most media ignoring Hunter Biden story," Oct. 14 2020 – This is a rush transcript from “The Ingraham Angle” October 14 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM FOX NEWS HOST: The first turkey we got to cook is Biden. And I'm going to do that in THE ANGLE. Hannity awesome show. Have a good one. Watch. Get a glass of wine. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Senator Josh Hawley is here. He's taken on Twitter and Facebook over their censorship of a story pretty harmful to Joe and Hunter Biden. So what is he doing and why does he say this is a tipping point? Plus Dr. Scott Atlas made huge waves last night at THE ANGLE calling out the so-called medical experts who are still advocating lockdowns. Now we have a really important update for you on that tonight. And what is something that Joe Biden should probably stop talking about? Of course Raymond Arroyo reveals it in ""Seen &amp; Unseen."" The third and final day of confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett came to a merciful close for Democrats. Now once again they chose to spend hour upon hour embarrassing themselves with a number of failed attempts to try to intimidate or trip up the judge. I'd like to do these reviews because I know you have realized you're not watching us. But let's start with dang dick Blumenthal's pathetic attempt to entrap Judge Barrett. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Lawrence v. Texas which held that the government cannot criminalize gay and lesbian relationships. Was it correctly decided? AMY CONEY BARRETT SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: Senator Blumenthal I again you know I've said throughout the hearing that I can't grade precedent on the words of Justice Kagan give it a thumbs up or thumbs down.  BLUMENTHAL: So you can't give me a yes or no answer. Again forgive me for interrupting but my time is limited. BARRETT: Well Senator Blumenthal I can't give a yes or no. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Blumenthal was just positively unbearable. A higher power must have gotten involved. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BLUMENTHAL: Legislative activism from the bench and the kind of activism that I fear you will bring to the bench is one-- (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Now the microphone Gods agree because Blumenthal is a complete insufferable bore and not to mention he's a doppelganger of George McFly from ""Back to the Future."" Do we have it? No. Yes.  For her part Senator Klobuchar tried to spin Barrett's nomination as some corrupt bargain. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): Did you have then a general understanding that one of the President's campaign promises was to repeal the Affordable Care Act when you were nominated? BARRETT: I'm aware that the President opposes the Affordable Care Act. KLOBUCHAR: Well I know you're aware now but were you aware of back then? BARRETT: It's just been part of the public discourse. KLOBUCHAR: OK. But it just - then is the answer yes then? BARRETT: You are suggesting I have animus or that I cut a deal with the president - that isn't what happened. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Amy's just mad that she's not up there. She's not going to the court. It was another swing and a miss. And as the hearing full of grandstanding by sorry buffoonish senators and it wouldn't be complete without Spartacus creating another unserious spectacle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): Do you think it's wrong to separate children from their parents to deter immigrants from coming to the United States? BARRETT: Well Senator Booker that's been a matter of policy debate. I can't express a view on that.  BOOKER: We're debating things that - to me are basic questions of human rights. I'm sorry that we can't have a simple affirmation of what I think most Americans would agree on. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Biden's buddy Senator Chris Coons he tried to tarnish the reputations of Barrett's and the late Justice Scalia in one fell swoop. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Justice Scalia's philosophy is significant. But I also think you've made it clear that it's largely your philosophy. If Justice Scalia had had his way we'd be in a very different country with regards to gender discrimination. BARRETT: I hope that you aren't suggesting that I don't have my own mind or that I couldn't think independently or that I would just decide like let me see what Justice Scalia has said about this in the past because I assure you I have my own mind. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now funny I didn't hear any commentators on CNN or MSNBC charge Coons with mansplaining to Judge Barrett. Why is that? I think Senator Marsha Blackburn summed it up best in her closing remarks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): They projected stereotypes onto you. Those stereotypes are what they think about us as women on the political right.  And they enjoy being able to mark and to ridicule and to diminish and to demean. To them it is political sport. It is the politics of personal destruction. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Joining me now is Jonathan Turley George Washington University Law Professor Fox News Contributor; and Robert Dunn Attorney and a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Jonathan this was - it was nowhere near the level of abuse that Kavanaugh got of course two years ago. But they still had to get in their jabs and to try to make it as painful as possible for Barrett and her family. Your reaction tonight. JONATHAN TURLEY FOX NEW CONTRIBUTOR: Well she did very well. The questions that were asked of her really weren't premised on getting an answer of any kinds since she had continually cited the Ginsburg rule so she would not talk about future cases. But that really wasn't the point. It seemed like the Democratic senators were really sort of making a case unrelated to the nominee. They were bringing up President Trump and all of the sort of political divisive issues that have gone into this election. Much of the questioning I think all this was rather embarrassing. I thought the high point was Dick Durbin. I thought he did a very good job.  In fact the exchanges between Durbin and Barrett were the most substantive of the hearing. They almost stumbled on that accidentally. But they actually hit substantive moments where cases were discussed. But what was most interesting about the hearing was really when she talked about - or when she was allowed to talk about her views of the law. And she gave a full throated endorsement of originalism. One of the most clear and unambiguous endorsements of originalism I've seen in a nominee. And what's interesting is unlike many other nominees she clearly means it.  In fact not since Scalia have I seen a nominee that meant it like she did.  She's a real live originalist. INGRAHAM: Yes. TURLEY: And she also made very clear in these hearings that she does not believe that Roe v. Wade is so called super-precedent and that's very important. INGRAHAM: Well Robert Senator Klobuchar at one point seem to want to - well she was inferring or implying I should say implying that Judge Barrett got nominated because of her role in working for Bush v. Gore as a young lawyer in the challenge to the 2000 election results. Watch this exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KLOBUCHAR: Many argue that Bush v. Gore hurt the courts legitimacy. If you are confirmed the Supreme Court will have not one not two but three justices who worked on behalf of the Republican Party in matters related to the Bush v. Gore case. BARRETT: You're asking me whether I was nominated for this seat because I worked on Bush versus Gore for a very brief period of time as a young associate. That doesn't make sense to me. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now Robert Klobuchar is a former prosecutor. But back to Jonathan's point these were just for the most part lame questions. I might not think Durbin was as great as Jonathan did but he's maybe a little bit better. But it's not exactly an all-star lineup to compare yourself to. ROBERT DUNN CLERKED FOR JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS: No I mean the question makes sense though given how much love Trump has for Bush for Bush's brother. I mean we all know that two of them are thick as thieves. So that line of questioning was spot on. No I thought one of the interesting exchanges to me was with Kamala Harris where she was attacking Judge Barrett for rulings on behalf of corporations against employees. And she was counting up statistics as to you've ruled in favor of this constituency this many times and that constituency that many times. And to me that that was a perfect sort of revelatory moment of the differences in what Judge Barrett thinks she's doing when she's sitting on the bench and what Senator Harris thinks she should be doing. Because I went back and I looked at those opinions and all Judge Barrett is doing is applying the Federal Arbitration Act. It's a federal statute that requires judges to basically give deference to arbitration agreements. And if Senator Harris doesn't like the outcome guess what she sits in the branch of Congress that could repeal amend or replace the Federal Arbitration Act. So to sit there and judge or sit in judgment of Judge Barrett for applying a federal statute that Congress enacted is just insane. Judge Barrett is doing her job and sometimes employees win sometimes corporations win but that shouldn't matter to the judge. And it clearly doesn't matter to her she follows the law. And that's I think what we saw what the country saw for two days. INGRAHAM: Jonathan a few friends of mine who aren't the biggest Trump fans were messaging me yesterday saying Wow I wasn't expecting this type of judge to - and respond the way she did. I don't know what they were expecting like some scary jurist or someone who was seeming to be too meek or wasn't informed. I don't know what they were expecting. But I think she won over a lot of people who are very concerned. TURLEY: Well the polling actually shows that. She went up in the polls.  More people are supporting her nomination. She's very very good in these confirmation hearings. And I think that in many ways she is sort of the Rocky Balboa of nominees. And that in her previous palette confirmation they threw everything they had at her. They hit her with everything. And they really didn't leave a mark. And it's interesting on this confirmation they really stayed out of her reach. They - this was not someone that they expect that they would be able to take down. But what's unfortunate is that a lot of these cases were really misrepresented in a way that I thought was grossly unfair. They brought up a case involving fetal remains and it's an abortion case. And they kept hitting her with that case. The Supreme Court agreed with her position in that case. It's that her position ultimately prevailed. And so it was intellectual disconnect. INGRAHAM: Yes. TURLEY: And I thought she was very diplomatic instead of saying wait wait wait you seem to be missing the second half of the story? INGRAHAM: Yes. And for all the law geeks out there they also screwed up yesterday - they were trying to equate voting to - voting against accepting a case En Banc with a federal court of appeals and ruling on the merits.  And this was from a lawyer. It was quite - I can't remember which senator it was. I was like you've got to be kidding me. This is just like - this is like stuff you learned second year of law school. Jonathan and Robert we got to roll but thanks-- TURLEY: Well there's also-- INGRAHAM: Well we got to roll I'm sorry. TURLEY: OK. INGRAHAM: Come back soon. Jonathan and Robert thanks so much. Since there is zero doubt that Amy Coney Barrett is eminently qualified for the Supreme Court Biden's running mate today was relegated to just taking some pathetic ineffective jabs. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: This hearing has done nothing to alleviate the concerns raised about why this nominee was chosen to be candidate. People are very very scared. They are scared that allowing President Trump to jam this confirmation through would roll back rights for generations. They are also deeply concerned about what this means for our nation's continued pursuit of the timeless principle of equal justice under law. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That was a really compelling read. I'm concerned that we have senators who can't speak off the cuff. Here to respond is Senator Josh Hawley who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee but was actually in the room. Well Senator your colleague Senator Harris says that Amy Coney Barrett will be an affront to the principle of equal justice under the law.  Your response tonight. SEN JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Well first of all in terms of sounding scared I thought Senator Harris sounded scared and I can see why because Amy Coney Barrett is one tough customer. She sat in there in that chair for 12 hours two different days answered every question that came out. And I think there's a reason Senator Harris didn't want to show up in-person. She didn't actually want to go toe to toe with Judge Barrett because it's clear who came out on top. So listen the Democrats - bottom line Laura the Democrats don't know what to do with a strong independent woman of faith who is unabashedly pro- Life and not backing down from her convictions. She carried the day - the last two days. And the only thing that's an affront is the Democrats.  They're an affront to this whole constitutional process. They tried to make a mockery of it. They lost. INGRAHAM: Senator Hirono for people who missed it made this claim about Judge Barrett. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): In accepting your nomination you described Justice Scalia as your mentor that's been mentioned many times before. It appears that you may be even more to the right of Justice Scalia whom you described as the staunchest conservative. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: That was another Oliver Wendell Holmes there. Senator I watched this just having clerked on the court and I had the privilege of knowing Justice Scalia quite well and of course Justice Thomas. And I see the senators up there and I think is this really the best the Democrats can do? Is Hawaii really proud of Mazie Hirono?  HAWLEY: It was it was quite a performance by the Senate Democrats over these last two days trying to twist Judge Barrett's words trying to make stuff up out of whole cloth attacking her for faith. They said they wouldn't and then they went right on ahead and did. Senator Leahy attacked her for speaking to a group of Christian law students. I mean imagine that the horror of it. Senator Blumenthal Senator Hirono attacked her for adhering to the positions of her Catholic faith. Again imagine that. It's - there are only 65 million Catholics in America. Imagine a devout Catholic who would think this kind of stuff is just outrageous and they're going to lose Laura is the bottom line here. They're going to lose. Judge Barrett did not back down one inch. And I couldn't be more proud to support her. INGRAHAM: And really quickly senator your reaction to that story from ""The New York Post"" today based on emails between Hunter Biden and Burisma officials. Now among them was one from this Burisma executive who thanked Hunter for ""The opportunity to meet your father and spent some time together."" Senator look this story stunned from the very beginning. But now the aftermath is Facebook and Twitter censored it and anyone who shared it?  You've spoken about the immunity these companies get. What is going on here? HAWLEY: It's basically at this point Laura big tech versus democracy. I mean that's what it is. These tech companies want to rig an election. They want to control what we read. They want to control journalists in this country. They want to control the news. And we just can't let them. And that's why I will be inviting and asking Facebook and Twitter to come testify under oath to my Subcommittee in the United States Senate. The American people deserve answers. I've also asked the Federal Election Committee to open an investigation. This is - looks like to me like an in- kind campaign contribution to the Biden campaign. I want to know what context did Twitter and Facebook and others have with the Biden campaign when they decided to start censoring this ""New York Post"" story on behalf of the Bidens. This thing just stinks. It reeks. And this is going to pull the lid off I think on just the corruption surrounding big tech. INGRAHAM: No. And Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Senator put out a statement earlier tonight saying ""Our communication around our actions on the New York Post article was not great. And blocking URL sharing via tweet or DM was zero context as to why we're blocking: unacceptable."" Well that's not saying they're unblocking it though senator right? It's just saying that we needed to explain why we blocked it. HAWLEY: Yes it's so insulting. I read that statement and I was insulted by it. It insults the intelligence of every single American citizen. We're not stupid. We can see that Twitter rushed to suppress this story to censor it on behalf of the Bidens-- INGRAHAM: It's pathetic.  HAWLEY: Just like Facebook rushed to do the same thing. Yes this is - they - the fix is in. They want to rig the election and use their monopoly power and we can't let them do it INGRAHAM: No no. And Senate has to act. You guys have to hold the Senate and then that legislation has to move forward. Senator great to see you tonight thanks for joining us. HAWLEY: Thank you. INGRAHAM: Coming up Dr. Scott Atlas dropped a bombshell last night about those who are still pushing these coronavirus lockdowns. And well he said they better be held accountable. My ANGLE provides an important update in moments. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: ""Biden and the COVID experts exposed"" that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. When do you think about it Joe Biden really has only one argument for his presidency that even attempts at cutting through and it would be that he is better at handling COVID. Well tonight his running mate made the case on Maddow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS: We must trust the scientists. Leave them to do their work. Leave them to guide our decisions and our policies. Joe cares deeply about science. He is knowledgeable he is fascinated he is interested. He is engaged in what science can do and must do to help the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Oh he likes reading science. She's reading notes. But there are a number of countries in Europe that listen to those same scientists who advocated widespread lockdowns and the results in Europe are a spectacular disaster. Now if you care about daily cases the U.K. has soared past the U.S. and the EU is close. Check out our case fatality rate compared to the EU and the U.K. Now on the trajectory of deaths who's doing better? Well we are. We're down 37 percent but Europe deaths are skyrocketing up 493 percent and 402 percent in the U.K. Now given all this and with the W.H.O.'S warning about how lockdowns are hurting the poor one might think that Europe now sees the folly of its own COVID response right? No. They're instituting more locked downs. Can you believe it? But certainly our experts the one that Kamala was talking about there well they recognize what's happening surely they do. Well what's Dr.  Anthony Fauci saying? Mostly he's worrying about those of you who refuse to skip your normal Thanksgiving with family and friends-- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DR. ANTHONY FAUCI DIRECTOR NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: That you may have to bite the bullet and sacrifice that social gathering unless you're pretty certain that the people that you're dealing with are not infected. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I'll have the turkey stuffing and a side of antibodies please.  Come on. Some of this is simple. A thing called Farr's Law tells us that we can't hide for a virus that has a natural ebb and flow. And the obvious conclusion from the European experience is that lockdowns only delay the inevitable. A few months ago the airheads in the media were freaking out about the Sunbelt's COVID surge. Remember that? Well look at them now.  Here's Texas and Arizona and look at Florida. Wow. Last night White House COVID Advisor Scott Atlas appearing on THE ANGLE he offered a brutal assessment of the public health commentariat. He didn't name names but he didn't have to. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT ATLAS SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT: History will record the faces of the public health expertise as some of the most sinful egregious epic failures in the history of public policy. And honestly some people say a crime against humanity these people should be held accountable to what they said. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Of course he's talking about every single public health expert who told us that lockdowns work. They also told us that Europe had a better approach and that vaccines are the only way to get back to normal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  FAUCI: If you're talking about getting back to a degree of normality which resembles where we were prior to COVID it's going to be well into 2021 maybe even towards the end of 2021. DR. PETER HOTEZ BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE: Get ready for a really tough time this winter. And get ready to hunker down. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB FORMER COMMISSIONER FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION:  We're still going to have a lot of death and disease between now and the end of the year. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Reviled by the same people last spring we now see that Sweden had the right approach and then the U.S. led by Trump was a close second.  Now if current trends continue we'll end up having fewer cases than Europe and a far better economy than the Eurozone as well.  Trump has pushed therapeutics and as a former patient in a high risk group himself he showed us he recovered within 10 days. He had obviously great therapeutics behind himself. But he showed us with his own actions that we need to get back to work even during a pandemic.  Unless you're a regular ANGLE viewer you may not know the real truth and that's frightening. America is going in the right direction on the stats that matter. So while case numbers may be going up because we're testing what a million people a day deaths are down. And while case numbers are up because you know we're testing all that we have to remember CNN doesn't know the truth. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BRIANNA KEILAR CNN HOST: Not a single state in this country is heading in the right direction with coronavirus infections. JOHN KING CNN ANCHOR: We do this every day. Orange and red are bad. This is horrific a horrific map. POPPY HARLOW CNN ANCHOR: There's no green state on that entire map now of the U.S. ALISYN CAMEROTA CNN ANCHOR: Small household gatherings are a growing source of coronavirus spread. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Now what's the chance that none of these people have gone to a dinner party without masks in the past six months? Zero. Public health officials like Fauci have a duty to consider the unintended consequences of the pandemic response. But they rarely if ever do.  Hundreds of scientists have signed on to the Great Barrington Declaration against lockdowns and for a return to common sense anti-COVID measures. But the last thing Democrats want to hear are these four words ""Go back to work."" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOHN BERMAN CNN ANCHOR: We've known for some time that Scott Atlas and the body language from the White House has been that they are supportive of the idea of herd immunity. CAMEROTA: They are now inflicting their idea of herd immunity on the country. DR. SANJAY GUPTA CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: This is the embodiment to me of anti-science. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: The science? Now that's funny. There was never any real science behind COVID lockdowns and the evidence that all of our mask wearing works is also murky to say the least. A new CDC study shows that the majority of those infected with COVID-19 always wore masks. Oops.  Oh wait that must be why Joe wore not one but two masks yesterday when visiting Florida. Tomorrow it will be three masks. By Election Day I don't know maybe he will have 20 overlapping masks on his face. Doesn't that make you all feel safe?  And that's THE ANGLE.  Joining me now Dr. Harvey Risch professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Medicine. Dr. Risch beyond lockdowns you say that the experts who have run our response and certainly running the European response or are killing Americans in other ways. Explain.  DR. HARVEY RISCH YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH:  Good evening Laura. Yes I think that it's taken a very high toll on people out of work people limited in their economic opportunities having to pay bills and rent and mortgages and so on and not being able to do that. And it's taken a toll on their mental health as well. The inability to seek medical attention that they would otherwise have had to get for other diseases is a very important component of the cost of lockdown.  INGRAHAM:  Well there is a moment from Dr. William Haseltine lately where he is poo-pooing along with a lot of experts who I'm sure make a lot of money being on a lot of boards poo-pooing the idea of acquiring or herd immunity. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. WILLIAM HASELTINE FORMER HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL PROFESSOR:  Herd immunity is another word for mass murder. That is exactly what it is. If you allow this virus to spread as they are advocating. We are looking at two to six million Americans dead not just this year but every year. The reason for that is that there is no such thing as herd immunity.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  Any response to that? I'm not sure what he's wearing. Is that the ""Star Trek"" enterprise outfit? Whatever. Dr. Risch what do you --  RISCH:  I don't know how he can say that honestly. People do have some degree of immunity that lasts for at least a few months if not quite a bit longer. We know that herd immunity does not have to be 80 percent or 90 percent. There was a paper in ""Science"" by Tom Britton a few months ago that showed that with communities the way they normally mix people in communities herd immunity can be obtained somewhere in the 40 percent to 50 percent range. And herd immunity is what's going to save the country from an endemic pandemic and that's what we have to face.  INGRAHAM:  Dr. Irwin Redlener of Columbia University wants Fauci and company to resign. But here's why.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. IRWIN REDLENER MSNBC PUBLIC HEALTH ANALYST:  I have an op-ed coming out tomorrow morning that will be calling for Fauci and five of his colleagues to step down en masse now before the election. Donald Trump is unhinged and has caused an incredible number of problems including a lot of unnecessary unavoidable deaths among people who could have survived if we had been doing things the right way from the beginning of this crisis.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  Dr. Risch you likely think Fauci and Redfield should resign for other reasons I imagine.  RISCH:  Correct. But blaming the president for the deaths when the FDA caused the deaths is really hypocritical and absurd.  INGRAHAM:  We also don't know how many excess deaths there are. I know in Denver they found out Doctor that there were an excess number of individuals dying at home from heart attacks in the two weeks following their really strict lockdown. People were just refusing to notice their own signs of pain or not wanting to act on it. So there are all sorts of ripple effects from these lockdowns that I never hear Dr. Fauci talk about ever.  RISCH:  That's correct. That's all going on.  INGRAHAM:  Dr. Risch thank you so much.  And up ahead Joe Biden loses his grip on reality and comes to the defense of his favorite campaign surrogate. Raymond Arroyo explains. ""Seen and Unseen"" next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM:  It's time for our ""Seen and Unseen"" segment where we reveal the stories behind the headlines. For that we are joined by our next guest FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo whose new book ""The Spider Who Saved Christmas"" is out tomorrow.  Raymond Joe Biden was off the trail but the coverage of his Florida campaigning was scant. So what did we miss?  RAYMOND ARROYO FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Laura Biden went down to Florida to make his case to seniors but he sounded like a PSA pitch man. Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  If we do not find an answer to Alzheimer's within the next 19 years every single solitary bed that exists the United States of America now will be occupied by an Alzheimer's patient.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  OK The Alzheimer's -- what happened there?  ARROYO:  The Alzheimer's Foundation projects 11 million people to be stricken with Alzheimer's dementia in 20 years. Are there only 11 million beds in the United States? There are nearly 5 million hotel rooms OK.  And why is the president responsible for doing what scientists and researchers can't? This is the problem with politicizing a disease making it a campaign issue which we have seen over and over again in this campaign certainly from the Biden side of things.  INGRAHAM:  It always falls flat Raymond. And when Trump runs an ad quoting Dr. Fauci accurately I might add in saluting the administration's handling of COVID Biden rushes in to defend his surrogate Fauci.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  He's running a national ad quoting Dr. Fauci out of context. Even after Fauci said that he didn't say that about the president the Trump ad campaign said they were going to continue to use the ad knowing knowing it was a lie. Can any of you ever remember anything like that in a presidential campaign with a mainstream candidate?  (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO:  Laura can you ever remember a mainstream candidate lying in a presidential campaign about say his background or his son Hunter promising access to his V.P. dad?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I don't know what he was doing. I know he was on the board. I found out he was on the board after he was on the board and that was it.  It's not a conflict of interest. There's been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else period. I am a hard coal miner anthracite coal Scranton Pennsylvania.  HBCUs -- I got started out of an HBCU Delaware State.  (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO:  For the record Laura Biden was never a coal miner. He never attended a Historically Black University Delaware State or otherwise. And once ""The New York Post"" released those emails from Hunter Biden showing that Joe Biden met with Ukrainian energy officials before lobbying to fire that Ukrainian prosecutor Biden today shut down coverage and public events announcing a lid before 10:00 a.m. This man has more lids than Tupperware Laura. I've never seen anything like it.  INGRAHAM:  That's good. That's good.  It might be hard for people to understand the whole grift thing but let's just say grift OK. The Biden family and gripped. Before we go -- before we go Raymond you have a picture book out.  ARROYO:  I do indeed. It's called ""The Spider who Saved Christmas."" It's coming out tomorrow.  INGRAHAM:  Where did it come from? Where did it come from? That's an interesting title.  ARROYO:  Remnants of this title are all around us every Christmas Laura.  It's the tinsel we see in trees. That's the homage if you will the remnant of this story. But somehow we have forgotten the story itself. It's an old legend that goes back centuries. It's about a spider who encounters Mary and Joseph and the Baby Jesus in the middle of the Christmas story.  And I thought it's uplifting for families. It also teaches us that you can find hope in even the darkest places. And sometimes that hope comes from very common things and even frightening things at times.  So kids have loved it. It's a great conversation starter at the holidays.  And I think people are going to love it.  INGRAHAM:  We haven't even had Halloween and it's already Christmas. We're already pushing the Christmas books. ARROYO:  Well we've got to mention it. It's out there.  INGRAHAM:  I'm afraid of spiders as Raymond know because he will always say there's a spider on you and I scream. So I'm terrified of spiders but the book is fabulous. Of course I've already read it. The book is fabulous. Raymond congrats. And you can get to Amazon Barnes &amp; Noble wherever books are sold.  And still ahead what do the Democrats focus? Race of course during the Barrett hearing. And what does it tell us about the future of the Democrat Party? Candace Owens is here. You're kidding me. Who better to get reaction on that? Next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM:  When they weren't fearmongering over COVID Senate Dems were trying to pelt Judge Amy Coney Barrett with loaded racial questions.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Voting discrimination still exists. No one doubts that. Do you agree with that statement?  SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI) SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Do you believe Judge Barrett that voter suppression or discrimination in voting currently exist?  SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL) SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Does the president have the authority to unilaterally deny the right to vote to any person based on their race?  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  Georgetown should ask Dick Durbin for his law degree back.  Senator Booker leveled perhaps the most disgusting of all charges.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I hope you understand my heart when I look at a justice who it seems that the fixes is in is going to serve on the Supreme Court and hasn't taken steps to understand the pervasiveness the facts the truth about cases of race that are going to come before you.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  And the winner for best male actor in a continuing drama goes to Spartacus.  Joining me now Candace Owens Blexit movement founder author of ""Blackout."" Candace I just want you to react to Spartacus because he was trying to conjure up all this emotion. I think he's a frustrated thespian.  CANDACE OWENS COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR TURNING POINTS USA:  Honestly it is just always remarkable to see him. And you are correct. This is the ""I am Spartacus"" guy during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. And he always just seems like he's ""Days of Our Lives."" There is no one more soap opera.  Laura I hope you understand with me coming on the show where my heart is in talking about these issues.  (LAUGHTER) OWENS:  He's not even a good actor.  And it's also plainly ridiculous that they keep asking these questions because what they are trying to examine her on is her emotionality. And that's the last thing Americans should want in the Supreme Court in a Supreme Court justice. We don't want emotionality. We want rationality. We want to make sure that she is able to serve and apply the Constitution and apply the law equally. And we know she can.  Even under all of this is some sort of an implication that she might be a racist right because that always seems what the Democratic attack is.  They want to always paint somebody as a racist if they are a conservative.  She has two black children. So this is falling flat.  And I will say this -- they're not landing any hits on her. She is strong.  She is strong and every time they attempt to attack her on something and it seems so meaningless I actually think it helps our side and it makes him look very very bad.  INGRAHAM:  No they were just flailing all day long. It got tedious to watch but it was enjoyable.  (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM:  Candace I want to get to this. The media apparently they want everyone to believe that now if you have to wait in the line to vote your basically living in the new Jim Crow era.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN WILLIAMS MSNBC HOST:  Eleven hours to vote in the United States of America. Let's use plain English and call it what it is -- voter suppression.  GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D) NEW YORK:  Would you wait 10 hours to vote? It creates a big risk of de facto suppression.  JASON JOHNSON MSNBC POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Voter suppression tactics that are being used in Texas forcing people oftentimes black and brown people to stand in line for three four and five hours.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM:  Candace when did having to wait in a line become a civil rights violation?  OWENS:  I am telling you we are the most overprivileged people that have ever lived in the history of the world. The fact that this is even a discussion or a debate mind you the same people that will wait 20 hours in the line on Black Friday for a black screen TV. These are the people we are talking about right. And now all of a sudden it's this great injustice in America. Forget the flatscreen TVs that we're willing to wait for but what's a great injustice is we have to wait in line to vote.  Am I being oppressed on Sundays when I have to wait at Trader Joe's and the line is wrapped all the way around? Have I been oppressed my entire life Laura at the DMV? Have I been scoring oppression points my entire life?  It's waiting in a line. That is not voter suppression. It takes a little bit of patience. And I think it's plainly ridiculous. But again what are they trying to feed? It's this narrative that somehow we are trying to stop people from voting.  And by the way do you want to know why half of these lines are so long?  Because of COVID-19 restrictions. They keep showing these aerial images.  Now we all have to be six feet apart. that contributes to this madness that we're seeing.  And also Laura it's important to point out this is early voting. This is optional. You can go back another day. So all of this is madness but that's what the left is always about emotionality and madness and a lack of rationality.  INGRAHAM:  Before we go Candace I have to get your thoughts on this really important story tonight from ""The Hollywood Reporter"" OK. Jussie Smollett is now to make feature directorial debut with James Earl Hardy book adaption. Candace didn't he already make his debut when he directed that hate crime hoax?  (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM:  What happened there? Wasn't that his first production?  OWENS:  This was absolutely his first production. But you know what this really speaks to is just the corruption and the protection that is around him. Could you imagine if a white person faked their own hate crime? The amount of people and the hoops that they have to jumped through he should be canceled and we should hear from him again. In fact in my opinion Jussie Smollett should be in prison for what he did. He went to foster a narrative that there were race issues and he paid people in order to do this. And look at this. He gets another chance. He gets to be a director Laura.  INGRAHAM:  Unbelievable rewarding failure. Candace great to see you.  And still ahead Trump turns up the heat in Iowa. The Last Bite explains.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM:  Trump was on fire tonight in Des Moines but it was this moment that really turned up the heat.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Should I take off the tie or not what do you think? I don't know. Maybe yes?  (APPLAUSE) That feels so much better. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: It was like a Tom Jones moment. I'm really dating myself by saying that by the way. All right. That's all the time we have tonight.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. BRET BAIER FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thanks Jesse. Good evening welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.  Breaking tonight President Trump and Joe Biden go head-to-head but the election still 19 days away. Tonight both the president and his challenger Joe Biden will compete for T.V. audiences in separate town hall events on different networks. These meetings were set up after a virtual debate that was scheduled for this evening was cancelled. There's also news about that cancel debate's moderator tonight we'll bring you that. Also both members of the Democratic ticket are in the same area as people on that campaign test positive for the coronavirus. Earlier today President Trump spoke at a rally in North Carolina. He said Joe Biden and his family are being protected by big tech after Facebook and Twitter censored a report about Hunter Biden's e-mails -- alleged e-mails. That is where we begin tonight with chief White House correspondent John Roberts live on the North Lawn. Good evening John. JOHN ROBERTS FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Bret good evening to you. Time may be running out for social media companies to censor content without repercussion. The FCC Chairman Ajit Pai today saying that he is going to move to clarify a rule that has so far shielded Facebook Twitter and others. This as the president again today vows to go after social media companies as he turns up the heat on Joe Biden. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: In Greenville North Carolina today President Trump vowing to keep pushing the Joe and Hunter Biden e-mail story despite Twitter and Facebook moving to censor postings that contain e-mail addresses or other personal information. DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He's a corrupt politician just remember it. And I'm going to say it more and more and Facebook and all can try and shut us down but you know what everybody knows it. ROBERTS: Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany's personal Twitter account continues to be locked after she posted screen shots of the e-mails. The Trump campaign's team Trump Twitter was temporarily blocked today.  Communications Director Tim Murtaugh scolding Twitter in a statement saying this is election interference plain and simple. President Trump again pushing to repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act shielding social media companies from legal action over censorship. TRUMP: We're going to take away their Section 230 unless they shape up. ROBERTS: North Carolina and it's 15 electoral votes were key to President Trump's win in 2016. A new New York Times poll finds Joe Biden leading the president by four points in the Tar Heel State. The RealClearPolitics average shows President Trump trailing by three points but that's exactly where he was on October 15th four years ago. TRUMP: Well don't clap too hard. Go out and vote. We'll clap later. ROBERTS: The president again today making an appeal to suburban women a key voting group he currently trails Biden with. TRUMP: The suburban women should love Trump. ROBERTS: President Trump also tried to calm concerns about a recent spike in coronavirus cases in North Carolina. The president touting new treatments and looming vaccines and going back to the same well he drew from six months ago. Again insisting the virus will eventually burn out on its own. TRUMP: It's ending anyway. I mean they go crazy when I say it. It's going to peter out and it's going to end. ROBERTS: From North Carolina President Trump off to Miami the site of tonight's canceled second presidential debate the president in an NBC News town hall. At the same time Joe Biden participates in a competing town hall on ABC. President Trump musing on what's in store for him compared to NBC's recent town hall with Joe Biden. TRUMP: I just want to see the tone of the way they treated this character and the way they treat us. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: There are complains that by appearing in competing town halls voters won't get a chance to watch both candidates tonight. Ultimately bragging rights may go to the candidate who gets the best ratings this evening Bret. BAIER: All right John thank you. I'll be watching both. I'll be on Shannon show later tonight with a wrap up. Meantime Joe Biden's presidential campaign says vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris's suspending in-person events until Monday after two people associated with the campaign tested positive for coronavirus. We also learned this afternoon Biden himself has been around someone infected. Correspondent Peter Doocy reports tonight from Wilmington Delaware. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER DOOCY FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Joe Biden wore two masks at once on his flight to Florida and as it turns out there was an administrative official from the charter company sitting in the last row infected with COVID-19 on that flight and one to Ohio Monday. But Biden is not changing his schedule since the sick person never got within 50 feet and all parties wore masks. Part of the safety plan carefully crafted when he started flying regularly. JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've worked out a protocol where how I get on the plane what kind of plane I'm getting on how it's sanitized where how I engage people. DOOCY: His running mate Kamala Harris was confident in those protocols last night. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you feel safe campaigning during COVID? SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well we've been very safe. And you know again the president has made fun of us but we wear masks. DOOCY: But today cancelled events through Sunday because two people on a plane with the V.P. nominee one week ago got sick. Communications director Liz Allen and a member of the flight crew. JENNIFER O'MALLEY DILLON JOE BIDEN CAMPAIGN MANAGER: During the flight Senator Harris wore an N95 mask as did both individuals who's not within six feet for more than 15 minutes with either of them.  Therefore she does not meet the CDC definition of close contact for exposure. DOOCY: That flight was the same day as a rare joint appearance by Harrison and Joe Biden in Phoenix. HARRIS: Joe has had a plan for COVID at least since March. DOOCY: Biden holds an 11-point lead over Trump with registered voters in an NBC Wall Street Journal poll. The campaign raised $383 million just last month. BIDEN: That's more than money I've ever raised in my whole -- in my whole life. DOOCY: Alluding to scandalous stories about his son Biden told donors this about Trump. We have 19 days left and you know he's going to throw everything but the kitchen sink at me. He's going to be on the trail solo through the weekend though during the biggest test yet of the campaign's COVID plan. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What is the established plan if one of you contract COVID between now and the elections? HARRIS: The plan is not to get it.   (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: Even though Joe Biden sat in a cabin with somebody now sick with COVID-19 on Monday and Tuesday the campaign says they have not been advised to take any additional precautions to protect campaign staff or the former vice president. So he is going to fly again tomorrow morning to campaign events in Michigan Bret. BAIER: Peter Doocy live in Wilmington. Peter thanks. The Congress is jumping into the fray over the social media response to the Hunter Biden e-mail story. Senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel has an update tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): This is election interference. The Senate Judiciary Committee wants to know what the hell is going on. MIKE EMANUEL FOX NEWS HOST: Outrage on Capitol Hill after learning the New York Post reporting on Hunter Biden's e-mails was censored on social media. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): I hope that we'll subpoena both Twitter and Facebook. They should both come. They're both engaged in censorship. EMANUEL: Delaware Democrat Chris Coons praise the social media giants for taking action. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Facebook and Twitter have policies to not spread things that are utterly unreliable that have been debunked and where their origin is untrustworthy. EMANUEL: But Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham says there is a double standard. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Nobody in Twitter and social media shut down anything about Trump and Russia. EMANUEL: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey criticized his platform publicly. Our communication around our actions on the New York Post article was not great and blocking URL sharing via tweet or D.M. with zero context as to why we're blocking: unacceptable. The story broke yesterday. Fox News obtained several e-mails purportedly between Hunter Biden and Ukrainian energy executive Vadym Pozharskyi who is a top official at Burisma. I one alleged e-mail he thanks Hunter Biden for inviting him to Washington and ""giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent some time together"". The Biden campaign says there is no such meeting listed on the vice president's official schedule.  The reported e-mails are from a laptop that the owner of a computer repair shop says was dropped off in April 2019 and never picked up. The computer technician initially said he wasn't sure it was Hunter but then changed the story. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When did you realize that it was Hunter Biden's laptop? JOHN PAUL MAC ISAAC DELAWARE COMPUTER REPAIR SHOP OWNER: When he paused and said Biden like I was expecting to know who he was. EMANUEL: Trump confidante Rudy Giuliani talked about how he got involved. RUDY GIULIANI FORMER ATTORNEY OF DONALD TRUMP: The document that I have signed by Hunter Biden says that after 90 days the hard drive is abandoned and it becomes the property of the merchant. He legally turned it over to the FBI and then he legally turned it over to my lawyer it's now his property. He can do what he wants with it. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: As for the fallout on Capitol Hill the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on issuing subpoenas to the big tech executives Tuesday. That could set the stage for a high stake hearing with them on a hot seat next Friday. As for Twitter it appears the social media site is down right now. A spokesperson telling Fox they're looking into it Bret. BAIER: OK Mike thank you. C-SPAN has suspended its political editor after he admitted that he lied about his Twitter feed being hacked after an exchange with a former Trump aide who is now a Trump critic. And when that surfaced Fox News media analyst host of Fox's ""MEDIA BUZZ"" Howard Kurtz has specifics tonight about Steve Scully. Good evening Howard. HOWARD KURTZ FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST: Bret good evening. When the Presidential Debate Commission tapped C-SPAN's Steve Scully to moderate the second debate which was to have been tonight he seems like a logical choice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  STEVE SCULLY POLITICAL EDITOR C-SPAN: It's a big task but we're ready for it. (END VIDEO CLIP)  KURTZ: A 30-year veteran of the nonprofit network C-SPAN's political editor and Washington Journal host offered few opinions and once the backup moderator in 2016. But late today as you noted C-SPAN suspended Scully indefinitely for lying. President Trump had initially assailed the choice of Scully who was once a college intern for Joe Biden and Ted Kennedy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: And then you look at this guy Scully he turned out to be a fraud.  You look at Scully he was a never Trumper. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: And the president pounds when a Twitter message surfaced in which Scully asked White House aide turned fierce critic Anthony Scaramucci for advice on responding to Trump. Scully then claimed to be a hacking victim and there was skepticism because twice before in 2012 and 2013 he blamed hackers for certain tweets one of them on weight loss. This time the FBI was called in. Scully now tells the A.P. he was frustrated by Trump's comments and social media criticism and ""I falsely claimed that my Twitter account had been hacked. These were errors in judgment for which I am totally responsible for I apologize."" He asks for forgiveness. The network said Scully had made a serious mistake we were very saddened by this news and do not condone his actions but adding that he'd eventually return. Trump quickly reacted on Twitter. I was right again. Steve Scully just admitted he was lying about his Twitter being hacked. The debate was rigged. Did I show good instincts in being the first to know? Now the soft-spoken Scully is universally liked here in Washington but everyone including him recognizes that lying in journalism is a cardinal sin Bret. BAIER: And we'll see what it means for the Debate Commission as well. Howy thank you. Up next senators turned their fire toward each other over the Barrett nomination. We'll take you there. First here's with some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 31 in Denver as a wildfire in Larimer County grows to more than 158000 acres. An increase of more than 20000 from Tuesday making it the largest wildfire in Colorado history. The Cameron Peak fire is 56 percent contained. Fox 2 in Detroit as Michigan's attorney general's office says another person has been charged in the plot to kidnap Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer. That brings the total number of people arrested in the widespread insurgency plot to 14. And this is a live look at Los Angeles International Airport from Fox 11 our affiliate out there. One of the big stories there tonight for the second known time in weeks a person in a jet pack was seen flying close to commercial airplanes near LAX. The FAA says a China airlines crew reported the sighting and approximate altitude of 6000 feet.  Back on August 31st an American Airlines pilot reported seeing a mystery person in a jetpack flying around in the path of incoming jets. That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: 36 states are reporting an alarming increase in new coronavirus cases. The number of Americans meantime seeking unemployment benefits rose last week by the most in two months to 898000 as the pandemic continues to drag on the economy. Dr. Tony Fauci is criticizing a declaration by several scientists who support the concept of herd immunity. Fauci says the idea that the disease will stop spreading once nearly everybody has contracted it is ""total nonsense"". And the NFL's Atlanta Falcons have shut their facility because of positive tests down there. President Trump says Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett was toying with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the prospect of her confirmation is making their heads explode according to the president. The committee will take its vote one week from today. Fox News chief legal correspondent anchor of ""FOX NEWS @ NIGHT"" Shannon Bream tells us where things stand after the conclusion of the hearings. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHANNON BREAM FOX NEWS ANCHOR: With nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett's public testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee wrapped today members turned their arguments directly on each other slowly evolving from what had been the Democrats primary arguments that the nomination is somehow illegitimate. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): This is a sham. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is outrageous paragraph. BREAM: To acknowledging they can't stop it. SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): I recognize Mr. Chairman that this goose is pretty much cooked. BREAM: To begrudgingly admitting the president and Senate are within their constitutional boundaries to move Barrett's nomination forward. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): You're moving ahead with this nomination because you can but might does not make right. SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): This is the American people's seat. We've got historical precedent on our side and we've also got the Constitution and the best nominee I've seen in a long time. BREAM: The committee heard from witnesses today including the American Bar Association's Standing Committee an independent body within the broader ABA which has often faced the accusation that it doesn't treat conservative nominees fairly. PAMELA ROBERTS MEMBER AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION: Judge Barrett has earned and enjoys an excellent reputation for integrity and outstanding character. BREAM: There were also witnesses both for and against Barrett's nomination. LAURA WOLK FORMER NOTRE DAME LAW STUDENT: In part because of her unwavering support I am the first blind woman to serve as a law clerk on the Supreme Court of the United States. KRISTEN CLARKE PRESIDENT AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR LAWYERS' COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS: Judge Barrett's views are far outside the mainstream and for evidence of this one need to look no further than her own words before this committee this week. BREAM: GOP leaders have teed up an ambitious schedule for getting Barrett confirmed before Election Day. She's set to be voted out of the committee at 1:00 p.m. on the 22nd likely along party lines. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he'll take her nomination to the Senate floor on the 23rd and get to an actual vote within three to four days after that. (END VIDEOTAPE) BREAM: Though Democrats seem resigned to the fact that they really don't appear to have any tools left to stop Barrett's nomination one GOP Senator told me he is actually a bit worried because things have been going so smoothly. Remember it was only after his initial hearing that the years-old allegations surfaced against nominee now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Bret. BAIER: We'll follow it. See you tonight at 11:00 for a wrap-up of the town halls. BREAM: See you then. BAIER: Thanks Shannon. A third day down in a row for stocks. The Dow dropped 20 today the S&amp;P 500 lost five. The NASDAQ fell 55. Up next we talked to two senators: one Republican one Democrat about the Barrett hearings the election; other big breaking news. Keep it here. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVEN MNUCHIN UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY: I think her all- or-nothing approach doesn't make sense for the American public and politics are getting in the way. But the president and I are determined to keep working on a larger comprehensive deal. By the way you know if they would approve stand-alone checks which is mostly direct deposits we can get that money out quickly as well. So no the president and I and others are not giving up. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying it is time for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to fisher cut bait on coronavirus stimulus relief even as negotiations between the two continue. Just one of the many stores we're covering tonight from the Barrett hearings to the election 19 days away the Hunter Biden e-mails. We'll get reaction to all of it from both sides of the Senate aisle. First let's bring in Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen. Senator thanks for being here. SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): Bret great to be with you. BAIER: You know I want to start with this negotiation that is still ongoing. It was stopped for some time it's still the discussions are going. Why can't Congress get something across the finish line? VAN HOLLEN: Well that's a good question. Now because we've been trying for a very long time now the House of Representatives passed the Heroes Act more than five months ago. At that time Leader McConnell the Republican leader didn't want to do anything. And then the House of Representatives passed a revised version recently. And while I'm glad the talks are still going on between the administration and the Speaker Mitch McConnell just said today that anything in the range that Secretary Mnuchin and Speaker Pelosi are talking about is unacceptable in the United States Senate and does not have the support of a majority Republican senator. So we've all been very focused on the negotiations between the White House and Speaker Pelosi without recognizing that the huge impediment really is with the Senate Republicans and Mitch McConnell at this point in time. BAIER: I mean she had as the Speaker did a kind of an interesting interview with Wolf Blitzer the other day in part saying that she didn't want a check with Donald Trump's name going out before the election essentially. Why not get something instead of nothing before you know in coming days? I understand where you're saying that the bill passed for $2.2 trillion.  They're negotiating at about $1.8. But why not get $500 billion? Why not get a trillion something? VAN HOLLEN: Well what Speaker Pelosi the Democrats have said is we're not going to take this piecemeal and only support and first support you know Republican priorities. In each of these bills in addition to the amount of relief at stake there are also these poison pills that are included. If you look at what Senator McConnell put on the floor of the Senate most recently and apparently plans to do it again it would actually penalize schools that have not gone back to full classroom participation for safety reasons. They would get access to a much smaller pool of money then schools have decided to send all the children back to the classroom. So there are lots of details to these issues Bret that need to be resolved.  I would --  (CROSSTALK) VAN HOLLEN: I was glad to see that you know President Trump said he want to go above $1.8 trillion. And he got after Secretary Mnuchin for not bringing home a deal. I hope they can resolve it but I want to go back to the fact that you know Mitch McConnell -- Senator McConnell intends probably have a vote in this coming week on a package that isn't anywhere close to addressing all the issues. BAIER: OK. Well just for the state of the American people hopefully something can get across the finish line. I want to talk to you about this Hunter Biden e-mail story and social media reaction to it. Here is Senator Ted Cruz. Oh we don't have that sound bite. But he says let me be clear I don't know if these New York Post stories are true or not those are questions Vice President Biden should answer. But Twitter and Facebook and big tech billionaires don't get to censor political speech and actively interfere in the election. That's what they are doing right now. Do you agree with Senator Cruz? VAN HOLLEN: Well look I'm not here to defend all the decisions made by all the social media companies. And Jack Dorsey the head of Twitter did send out a statement saying that they should have provided an explanation for their decision. But I hope we would all agree Bret that we also don't want a social media companies to become viral engines for lies and disinformation. After all we were justifiably critical of them when the Russians used social media in the last election. I wish our Republican colleagues were more interested in stopping Russian interference in our election this time around but I hope we would at least look for a way to prevent sometimes dangerous misinformation regarding COVID-19 fabrications or other to go viral. BAIER:  Quickly are you saying that you don't believe that the emails are authentic? Why do you think the Biden campaign didn't go down that authenticity road with their statement about this?  VAN HOLLEN:  I don't know about the authenticity or not of these particular emails. What I do know is the idea that somehow Vice President Biden used his official position to benefit his son Hunter has been thoroughly debunked. Everybody who has looked at this has concluded there's no there there. I know Republicans continue to try to push that disinformation out.  They are even using Senate hearings for these political campaign purposes.  But the reality is there is no there there.  So I don't know the story with these particular emails. I looked at some of them. None of them indicate that the vice president actually provided any assistance at all to Hunter Biden. And so to create the impression and illusion that they did is pure political fabrication.  BAIER:  Senator Chris Van Hollen we appreciate your time tonight.  VAN HOLLEN:  Good to be with you.  BAIER:  Joining us now Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn. He sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator you just heard Senator Van Hollen.  Good evening. Your response to him?  SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): It's clear that the social media platforms are no longer just neutral platforms but definitely have a point of view. And it's very troubling that they used the legal authorities that they currently have under the Communications Decency Act Section 230 that we've talked a lot about in order to immunize them from any sort of criticism or reform.  And so the Judiciary Committee is issuing subpoenas to Twitter Facebook and the other platforms and we intend to get to the bottom of this because we can't have these platforms which are essentially public forums now censoring political speech especially in the run-up to an election.  BAIER:  What about senator Van Hollen's point about there is no there there when it comes to the Hunter Biden Vice President Biden connection or payoff?  CORNYN:  I don't know what is there but we need to find out and the American people deserve to know before they vote.  BAIER:  You've been in these hearings for the past few days Judge Barrett.  It seemed to take a bit of a turn from Democrats saying this is a done deal. It's baked in. Your thoughts on where things stand?  CORNYN:  Judge Barrett was an outstanding witness and I think blew everybody away with her intellect and command of the subject matter but also what a wonderful person she is her character and her integrity. So I believe she will be confirmed here in the next week-and-a-half or so. But it's clear my Democratic colleagues didn't want to talk about her. They wanted to talk about a hypothetical case that she might sit on in the future and focus their fire on President Trump. So they spent their time doing that instead of asking her questions but I think the questions we were able to ask her and the responses she gave demonstrated she deserves to be confirmed and I believe she will be.  BAIER:  I want to play a soundbite from President Trump talking about the selection specifically one group of people. Take a listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So why is it that the fake news keeps saying that women aren't going to like Trump? You know what women want more than anything else? They want safety security and they want to be able to have their houses and leave me alone right?  (APPLAUSE) TRUMP:  The suburban women. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER:  Suburban women the president is talking about there. There's a lot of talk Senator about Texas and ""Texas Monthly"" had this write-up about ""Should Trump lose Texas he has no path to victory. The electoral earthquake would shake the national Republican party to the ground. Even a close Trump victory is unlikely to protect the state GOP from further losses. Republicans are caught between a Trump-worshiping base and a burgeoning suburban electorate that finds him repellant.""  Your thoughts about that in your race which is closer than you've ever had before?  CORNYN:  This is the most unusual environment we've ever had. We learned in the Cruz-O'Rourke race that we had gotten complacent when it came to voter registration and the fundamentals of elections. But the amount of money coming into these races including into Texas that we've never seen before is really kind of making things a little more questionable than they would otherwise be. The president is ahead in Texas I believe he will win. I believe I'm ahead in Texas but not by a huge margin. And when Chuck Schumer and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced as they did today they're putting another $8.6 million in on top of the money they've already put in it does have an impact.  But we're ready to litigate this and I believe based on policy alone we don't want to make Texas into California or New York which is what Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi want to do. So I think we are right on the issues and we will prevail.  BAIER:  I'm going to end where I started with the Senator Van Hollen and that is the prospect what do you think about a coronavirus stimulus getting done? It's still under negotiation between Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi but it sounds like Senator McConnell is not ready to go anywhere near where the administration is going.  CORNYN:  Bret we already passed $3.8 trillion worth of COVID-19 relief and I believe we do need to do some more. That's why I was disappointed when Senator Van Hollen and all Democrats voted to block another half- trillion dollar bill on September 10th. They just blocked it. Speaker Pelosi said nothing is better than something which I think is the opposite of what most of us believe a half a loaf is better than no loaf. But Senator McConnell is determined but the bill on the floor again next week and to see whether Democrats are serious or whether this is just politics.  BAIER:  Senator Cornyn we appreciate your time.  CORNYN:  Thank you very much.  BAIER:  A democrat a Republican talking about the issues of the day.  Up next the battle between Republicans and the California government over unofficial ballot drop boxes. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER:  The Postal Service will reverse changes that slowed mail service nationwide. That decision settles a lawsuit filed by Montana Democratic Governor Steve Bullock. He contended the changes impeded the ability of his constituents to vote by mail. He also said they caused delays in the delivery of medical prescriptions payments and job applications. The Postal Service agreed to reverse all changes and prioritize election mail. Speaking of the election the California Republican Party is refusing to comply with an order from the state's chief elections official to remove unofficial ballot boxes from counties with competitive U.S. House races.  That is just one of many legal disputes involving early voting as voters shatter records for early voting throughout the country. Let's get an update tonight from national correspondent William La Jeunesse in Los Angeles.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAY POGGI CALIFORNIA VOTER:  I just want to make sure my ballot got in and I know it's here at the county right at the registrar's office.  WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  In person and by mail less than three weeks out Americans are voting in a record number is.  JOAQUIN PEREZ VIRGINIA VOTER:  The first time I'm voting early but I didn't want to leave it to chance.  LA JEUNESSE:  More than 15 million already voted shattering records in Texas and Georgia.  JASON MOORE TEXAS VOTER:  A lot of people suffered and died for our right to vote so I'm out here honoring that.  LA JEUNESSE:  But in 44 states 300 legal battles continue.  J. CHRISTIAN ADAMS PUBLIC INTEREST LEGAL FOUNDATION:  These cases have been filed in almost every state ranging from South Carolina to Connecticut. You get the whole range of blue versus red being the subject of litigation.  LA JEUNESSE:  In Wisconsin New Hampshire and Georgia judges this week sided with Republicans requiring all mail-in ballots be received by Election Day. Democrats scored victories in Virginia Pennsylvania and Michigan relaxing rules on signatures and late arriving ballots.  JULIE WISE KING COUNTY WASHINGTON ELECTIONS DIRECTOR:  We know the truth here in King County that vote by mail is safe it's accessible and it's a secure way to vote.  LA JEUNESSE:  Washington like the majority of states requires ballots be postmarked on or before election day but can arrive days and in some states weeks later. In California the GOP taking no chances adding more of its own drop boxes in defiance of Democratic state officials.  HECTOR BARAJAS CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY:  We have a secretary of state that is engaging in voter suppression basically removing an option for individuals to turn in their ballot in a place they know and place they trust.  (END VIDEOTAPE) LA JEUNESSE:  The GOP ballot boxes are illegal says California but the state has yet to file a case. In Texas a state judge contrary to a federal ruling said today Governor Greg Abbott cannot limit ballot locations to one per county but an appeal is likely. Bret?  BAIER:  William thank you.  Up next the panel on the dueling presidential town halls and where we stand in this election 19 days out. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have some news to get to as well starting with those dueling town halls tonight.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is not what it was supposed to be. The president and Joe Biden were supposed to face off in their second debate.  TRUMP:  So they asked me if I would do it and I figured what the hell we get a free hour on television.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think that NBC is all in for Trump as they were for ""The Apprentice.""  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why not a new Bill Cosby special while we're at it?  (LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's no good reason to hold these events simultaneously.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If you want to give Donald Trump airtime on your network have him go on MSNBC. Have him go on with Rachel. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you as mad as everybody else that NBC is doing a town hall with President Trump tomorrow instead of the debate?  SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm not going to tell the networks what to do but I'll tell you I know who I'm going to be watching.  (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER:  The left is up in arms about the dueling town halls tonight as there was supposed to be a debate tonight in Miami. It was canceled first virtual and then canceled. And the moderator for that canceled debate Steve Scully from C-SPAN engaged in a controversy and now indefinitely suspended from C-SPAN. Here's how A.P. writes it up "" C-SPAN suspends Scully after he admits to a lie about a hack. Scully said that when he saw his tweet had created a controversy ""I falsely claimed that my Twitter account been hacked."" He had been frustrated by President Trump's comments and several weeks of criticism on social media and conservative news outlets about his role as moderator including attacks directed at his family he said. ""These were both errors in judgment for which I'm totally responsible for"" Scully said. ""I apologize.""  Just another day as we get closer to this election. Let's bring in our panel Charles Lane opinion writer for ""The Washington Post"" Katie Pavlich news editor at “Townhall” Byron York chief political correspondent for the ""Washington Examiner."" A lot to talk about. Katie let's start with you your thoughts on these developments.  KATIE PAVLICH NEWS EDITOR “TOWNHALL”:  It sounds like many in the media and ABC News are concerned about a little bit of competition between Joe Biden and President Trump. It would be beneficials if they were facing off together but the Presidential Debate Commission made unilateral decision to turn a debate into digital without consulting any of the campaigns. So here we are with each candidate staking their claim tonight in primetime and talking to different types of voters in swing states Pennsylvania and the state they're fighting for in Florida. So that's an interesting development of course.  And then in terms of the debate moderator this is something that conservatives have been complaining -- not complaining about -- voicing concern about for years and years the idea that moderators are always unbiased despite what they portray. And I think the bigger issue here for Steve Scully is not just lying about a hack but also why was he reaching out to someone like Anthony Scaramucci for advice about how to handle President Trump? The president of course is talking about it on twitter saying he was right. But this is a bigger issue of media bias the president has rightfully been concerned about it for years and it's actually during a very contentious presidential election.  BAIER:  The tweet he sent it looked like he was direct messaging and he sent it out as a tweet Scaramucci saying should he respond to President Trump. Chuck had he come out and just said I screwed up and I was looking to respond I think it would've washed away. But it does bring into question the debate commission and now ahead of Nashville next week.  CHARLES LANE OPINION WRITER ""WASHINGTON POST"":  I think Steve Scully made a terrible mistake and belatedly admitted it and probably the worst part of it was to drag the commission into it. The commission vouched for Steve Scully's claim that he had been hacked and associated itself with what we now have come to find out is not the truth. And that's a very bad and unfair to the commission. So there's a cleanup on aisle five to be done around the Presidential Debate Commission.  I do think that nevertheless the president should have found a way to participate whether virtually or otherwise in the debate tonight. That's where we should have been and that's a disservice to the country because now we have this dueling town hall situation which this turns into rather than an opportunity for people to maybe compare and contrast. It's just the two tribes assembling in their separate territory. And I guess we'll have to see if things go a little better October 22nd.  BAIER:  Yes meantime the Hunter Biden story trying to get the authenticity of these emails still digging on this story but obviously a part of the story Byron is how it's been handled on social media. It almost fueled the story more. Your thoughts on where this stands tonight?  BRYON YORK CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ""WASHINGTON EXAMINER"":  Well it did. The social media angle obviously sort of took over the story. And it is absolutely outrageous what Twitter did and what Facebook did and it's bald censorship of journalism. And I think it's fine for Capitol Hill to look at some of the laws affecting the social media companies.  On the other hand the big story is still the big story which is did Vice President Biden when he was vice president meet with this official from Burisma that was paying his son all this money? Did that happen? Is that email genuine? We need to know more about the authenticity and accuracy of the story because that's the real story.  BAIER:  We should point out the Biden campaigns says the meeting never happened it wasn't on the schedules they say that they looked back at and the email itself says set up for a meeting. Katie take a listen to Rudy Giuliani and the owner of this computer store.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUDY GIULIANI PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY:  The process was that the laptop was left by Hunter Biden in in inebriated heavily inebriated state with the merchant. The merchant fixed the laptop tried to reach Hunter Biden and Hunter Biden never came back for it.  JOHN PAUL MAC ISAAC COMPUTER SHOP OWNER:  I'm legally blind. I have a visual acuity of about eight inches operational vision of three to four feet on a good day. If he came in and if it was late at night my eyes are tired. I probably couldn't see clear past two feet.  (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER:  Let's just not sugarcoated. The whole thing is sketchy. You couldn't write this script 19 days from an election but we are digging into where this computer is and the emails and the authenticity of it.  Katie where do you think this story goes?  PAVLICH:  Rudy Giuliani says that we've only seen a tiny part of what is actually on the hard drive and the worst story is to come on the alleged emails and deals with the Biden family are to come in terms of China the money they were getting the deals. And this isn't just about Hunter Biden.  This is about Joe Biden the former vice president of the United States and what he would do as president when it comes to dealing with these types of governments and regimes on behalf of the United States what his son was getting all these sweetheart deals using the Biden name.  BAIER:  All right panel thank you.  When we come back the brighter side of things some good deeds.     (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER:  Finally tonight some silver linings. A group of first responders in Florida went beyond the call of duty to help an Army veteran Prince Pinkney. The crew treated the 80-year-old after he fell ill working in his yard but their work was not done. You see what they're doing right there they stepped in and they finished cutting his grass. Pretty cool.  Anne Duncan tied the knot with her husband Bill a second time. Bill who has dementia forgot their first wedding so he proposed to Anne because he was convinced she was his new girlfriend. The couple remarried in an emotional ceremony at their home in Scotland. Pretty nice.  Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT fair balanced and unafraid. I'll be on with Shannon tonight 11:00 p.m. wrapping up those two town halls should be interesting. We're going to flip back and forth between them.

309,What's the latest on COVID relief legislation negotiations?," Oct. 15 2020 – This is a rush transcript from “The Five” October 15 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JESSE WATTERS FOX NEWS HOST: Hello everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Emily Compagno Juan Williams Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. it's five o'clock in New York City and this is The Five.  Twitter and Facebook have some serious explaining to do after censoring and blocking people from sharing an explosive New York Post report about Hunter Biden's alleged e-mails and his foreign business dealings.  Twitter going as far as suspending the Trump campaign's account and the personal account for White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.  Twitter's CEO admitting the company screwed up. But that's not going to cut it. President Trump sounding off on this major controversy earlier.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He and his family are crooked but they were caught they got caught and now they are being protected by big tech. I'll tell you what he really is. He is a corrupt politician.  Just remember. And I'm going to say it more and more and Facebook and all can try and shut us down.  But you know what? Everybody knows it. You don't have a kid who gets thrown out of the military he doesn't have a job for a long time. His father becomes a vice president and now this kid is going into every country walking away with millions of dollars from every country with no talent no skills no expertise and the press doesn't want to cover it because they are corrupt.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: And Republicans are ready to haul the heads of Twitter and Facebook in front of Congress.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): This is election interference and we are 19 days out from an election. It has no precedent in the history of democracy.  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Nobody in Twitter and social media shut down anything about Trump and Russia. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the attempt to rig an election which is what we are seeing here by monopolies is unprecedented in American history. They have a lot to answer for and I will subpoena both Twitter and Facebook.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: All right Mr. Williams as a lifelong journalist -- JUAN WILLIAMS FOX NEWS HOST: Yes. WATTERS: -- and as someone who values free speech freedom of the press you must be upset by the actions taken by these social media companies.  These are colleagues of ours New York Post reporters in the same building.  It's not right is it?  WILLIAMS: You know to the contrary I'm upset that the White House is trying to compel a private business to do its bidding. To say yes you are a private business but we want you to give us a platform for this scurrilous unverified information essentially political you know mudslinging and if you don't do it then we're going to say this is true.  (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: You are actually blaming Trump for the scandal Juan?  WILLIAMS: Trump is the one who is saying they are someone --  (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: This has nothing to do with Donald Trump. WILLIAMS: It does.  WATTERS: The New York Post story -- WILLIAMS: You didn't see him. WATTERS: -- by our company. WILLIAMS: Yes. WATTERS: By reporters who do a good job -- WILLIAMS: Well let me just say -- WATTERS: -- who got information published it and then got shut down by monopolies in Silicon Valley.  WILLIAMS: That's not true. WATTERS: A journalist should care about that.  WILLIAMS: I care. Well if I -- if you said to me that the administration was in fact saying this is the story and here it is and the press made a decision then somebody censored a legitimate but the press made a decision here.  WATTERS: The press or Facebook and Twitter?  WILLIAMS: Facebook and Twitter. WATTERS: They're not the press. WILLIAMS: No no no.  WATTERS: They're not the press. WILLIAMS: Wait a second. We -- a moment ago you were asking me as a journalist not as the executive director of Facebook or Twitter. As I said to you earlier they are private companies. The president and the politicians should not be telling them what to do that's wrong. But if you are talking about our colleagues in the building.  WATTERS: Yes. WILLIAMS: If you are talking about the press then I think listen the fact is as confirmed by a Republican Senate committee Joe Biden did nothing wrong with Burisma. In fact he was trying to get Burisma -- (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Your skill (Inaudible) that? WILLIAMS: Yes I think that's been confirmed. WATTERS: Because yesterday you said that there was no meeting. Because it didn't the calendar.  WILLIAMS: No I didn't know about it. WATTERS: And then today Politico says -- WILLIAMS: Right. WATTERS: -- the Biden campaign would not rule out the possibility that the former V.P. had some kind of informal or inner action with the Burisma executives.  WILLIAMS: Jesse excuse me. WATTERS: Yes. WILLIAMS: I believe the Trump campaign actually had a meeting with the Russian in Trump tower and then you want to say this is a possibility of a meeting that somehow evidence of wrongdoing?  WATTERS: What I'm saying is his son sold access.  WILLIAMS: No he didn't. And in fact the son -- WATTERS: The son sold access and got paid for it. WILLIAMS: No no. Hold on. WATTERS: And then fired the prosecutor investigating -- WILLIAMS: What we know -- WATTERS: -- the company he was getting.  WILLIAMS: Mr. Watters what we know is that in fact in the e-mails again these could be falsified e-mails this could be a Russian disinformation we don't know because -- WATTERS: Russian disinformation. WILLIAMS: -- because they won't give us -- they won't give us the actual e- mails. But what we know is -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: What do you mean they won't give you the e-mails. The FBI has the e-mails Juan. WILLIAMS: No no.  WATTERS: All tight. Let's go Greg anything you want to respond to what Juan is saying?  GREG GUTFELD FOX NEWS HOST: Well four years ago it was Access Hollywood now it's accessed Joe Biden. We'll be right back.  I am ticked off about COVID because we're not having Halloween and I finally found my Halloween costume which is Hunter Biden. Very easy shirtless sunglasses it's just a little crack pipe hanging out of your lip.  I find this funny that we are now calling this like unverified mudslinging as if that matters after the dossier the Russian collusion scam the Kavanaugh rape claims. It's interesting like this guy if he had been helpful the guy that ran the video store had been helpful to Biden he would be called a whistleblower. Right? But because this is helpful to Trump he's a nutcase. Right? This is such a weird story. The fact is the media could have done something about this.  They could have made some phone calls. Right? Instead of the -- instead of the story now exploding and being about the suppression of a story it could have been about verifying these e-mails. Let's find out if this is true.  I mean let's face it they didn't really scrutinize the origins of the tax returns I don't think Jack at Twitter was worried about that when that story came out but we'll let this happen but it's weird. Biden's camp their reaction to this is so muted. They haven't demanded a retraction they haven't said they haven't tried to disprove this instead he calls a lid. He retreated under his bed again waiting for his Ovaltine.  What is this telling you? It's telling you that this is probably true and it's really easy if you are a journalist start making phone calls. Call the guy call the Ukrainian business guy there are people that can verify e-mails. Why isn't that the story? Too late. Now you guys look like you're running for cover.  WILLIAMS: You know who could verify? Giuliani Steve Bannon and they won't give you the actual e-mails. WATTERS: No. Did you ask them Juan? WILLIAMS: I didn't. But I'm saying --  (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Maybe they will give them to you Juan.  WILLIAMS: No but I'm saying -- WATTERS: Maybe they'll give them to you. WILLIAMS: Greg raise a legit point. WATTERS: Juan. WILLIAMS: Go after the people go after the sources but I'm just telling you you can't find the e-mails so you can't see where these e-mails came from.  (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: OK. So now you actually have to see an e-mail that's your standard?  WILLIAMS: No I'm just saying that's what Greg suggested. WATTERS: A media company has to actually hold the e-mail in their hand in order to verify that it's true? Juan that high standard you'll never meet it.  Emily Juan was saying the other day like just a couple minutes ago that these companies can do whatever they want. In fact they can't do whatever they want. And now the FCC is saying we're going to look at rule 230 that allows them the tax world that they live in to be just publishers that they can just put it out there and not edit it and not tweak it and now that's jeopardized and so is a lot of money.  EMILY COMPAGNO FOX NEWS HOST: That's absolutely right. And first of all yes they are bound by regulations as well as their own terms and conditions and there are multiple government agencies that are investigating them actually. But I you know the goal of diversion however has been totally achieved.  We are talking about big tech and the continued pattern of muting conservative voices rather than those e-mails. But in the notion of against disinformation and misinformation as you've said I think it's important to remember that four days before this president was inaugurated then- outgoing Vice President Biden was in Ukraine for the sixth time in seven years. And after Russia invaded Crime Ukraine became a top priority for the Obama administration.  And it was basically outsourced for the vice president to handle. And his then foreign policy and defense policy adviser said it was our top priority always number one or one of the top three and Biden quote ""was front and center.""  So the notion or the concept that these e-mails definitely don't raise at least a question of unethical conflict of interest is utterly false. And that's what deserves an investigation  WATTERS: Let's get Dana in here. It did seem to backfire. We talked about this yesterday. The fact that they censored it I think I saw a report that now six times more people have seen this story just because of the controversy.  DANA PERINO FOX NEWS HOST: I felt like last night when Jack Dorsey of Twitter put out his statement trying to explain away things and say they didn't have good communications that he was writing Twitter's death sentence. He says we had a communications problem. We have a P.R. problem.  Like believe me when an executive a congressman your boss whoever says there's a communications problem 99 percent of the time you actually have a fact problem. And I'm not saying that these issues are not complex. I think that they are.  Because I was wondering you know let's say that something came to the daily briefing and it was about Don Jr. and it was under this fishy kind of what this guy and the e-mails I wouldn't run it. Now but if it did run if I were Don Jr's. people what I'd say that's unfair. That story is not true don't spread around. But who is going to be the arbiter of truth?  And that gets back to what Mark Zuckerberg told me a year ago he doesn't think social media companies should be the arbiter of truth. And would have it been better to allow the story out there and for journalists to do what they do which is try to track it down and then the marketplace of ideas on social media blasted away.  Now on the other side think about what the left has tried to do to social media company since 2016. They believe that the social media companies made Donald Trump's election possible because they didn't do enough to fight back against Russian interference.  So Silicon Valley is going to have its day in court and by that it means the court of public opinion and they're in the Senate. I will mention one other thing. I think what Twitter did was preposterous just so over-the- top they do not have a clear policy so they did something they went way overboard.  I mean blocking the Trump campaign's Twitter account?  WATTERS: It's crazy. PERINO: Blocking the press secretary's Twitter account? This is absurd. I think when Facebook is slightly more defensible. They say well when you see something like this we're going to get a third party to check it's going to take a while to check it. In the meantime we're going to suppress it.  I ask for an example. Had they done it before? There was an accusation that antifa was starting the wildfires in Oregon they suppressed that story until they could the fact check. The fact-check comes back no that's not true.  That actually seems like well that could work. But in a situation like this where you have e-mails that you can't get and a situation where this guy from -- but the story already went around the world 600 times it's really impossible to see how they could do this to scale and it could happen to any of us.  WATTERS: It could happen to me you are saying Dana?  GUTFELD: It already has. WATTERS: To me? PERINO: Well the good thing is you don't tweet. GUTFELD: Check your e-mail.  WATTERS: That's true.  GUTFELD: I leaked something last night. WILLIAMS: But Dana why should they open themselves to be a platform for dirty mudslinging?  WATTERS: They already have.  PERINO: I'm not -- I'm not saying it's not a complex issue. WATTERS: It's a political story in a campaign Juan.  PERINO: It is. GUTFELD: OK. Twitter -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: We've had a lot of dirty mudslinging. GUTFELD: Twitter has this hypocrisy. Its suppression versus amplification.  PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: If they agree with the story like a Kavanaugh stories or Covington stories -- PERINO: Right. GUTFELD: -- they amplify. They do. They amplify. Nobody cared about the Washington Post story on the Covington kids until somebody actually exposed it but then suppression -- suppression it's only one way they only suppress the stories that might hurt them.  WILLIAMS: But Greg we are doing the story though New York Times the Washington Post the L.A. Times everybody had the story today and said the story can't be verified. It's really scurrilous.  WATTERS: OK. Juan we don't take the New York Times saying we can't verify that story they run anonymous sources all the time. All right? WILLIAMS: OK. WATTERS: This is actually hard physical evidence with video and the vice president on tape saying I didn't give him a billion until you fire the prosecutor.  WILLIAMS: My gosh. WATTERS: Coming up liberals melting down over NBC hosting a Trump town hall. The reaction coming up.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: NBC facing some major backlash from just about every angle staffers at the company Democrats and even opposing networks are outraged that the news outlet is hosting a town hall with President Trump and that's because it will be competing with a Joe Biden town hall that will happen at the same time. Here's just some of the reaction.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DON LEMON HOST CNN: Why on earth would NBC agree to do that? You can do equal time at a different time. You don't have to do it at the same time and then -- and then divide the country further by having them choose.  This is an outright embarrassing ratings ploy on behalf of NBC and I am shocked and surprised that they would allow the President of the United States to do their programming and manipulate them into doing this. It is embarrassing. (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: The president tweeting I will be doing a major fake NBC News town hall forum live tonight from Miami at 8 p.m. They asked me to do it in place of the rigged Steve Scully. He is now suspended from C-SPAN for lying debate. I wonder if they'll treat me as well as sleepy Joe. They should.  Exclamation point.  When it comes to NBC's decision Greg it's all fair in love and war.  GUTFELD: For one thing OK you got it. CNN gave so much what you call earned media to Trump? They elected Trump. They have no say in this thing about morality whatever. If TV can -- if cable can counter-program so can candidates. So I thought it was pretty smart and he is the master of counter-programming.  I would say I have a suggestion for him that he should during his town hall have a screen with Biden's town hall going and do a little mystery science theater and comment on things get people to cut some tape that he can immediately respond to. But he's going to be prepared. It's going to be -- it's going to be a crazy night.  But again it goes back to the sentiment (Ph). Trump somehow always ends up being right like the Scully thing proves that it was rigged. It was rigged.  When the moderator is going to Scaramucci for advice the guy that has been a thorn in your side for three years that would be like right before the debate finding that Scully went to Giuliani to get information on Hunter Biden -- PERINO: Yes before the debate. GUTFELD: -- so he could ask Joe Biden. People would be screaming their heads off. WATTERS: I would have been screaming. GUTFELD: No you wouldn't. You've been very happy. Lastly I do think that like this kind of lends itself to the problem here with these debates that they portray liberal moderators as conventional objective moderators.  They aren't.  WATTERS: Right. GUTFELD: You need a wrath. You need straight wrath and you have the candidates ask each other the questions. Joe asks Trump. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: Trump asks to Joe and you have a wrath. Because right now you can't seem to get a moderator who is not liberal. I don't know why I'm available. She laughed. You laughed again.  PERINO: I'm having a great time. It's a good day. GUTFELD: There you go. PERINO: Jesse tonight was supposed to be the biggest debate.  WATTERS: Well that's why we're having -- (CROSSTALK) PERINO: That's just been easier?  WATTERS: -- a conversation about this dueling town halls because the debate commission -- PERINO: Right. WATTERS: -- really messed up and made it virtual when Trump would have been recovered and clean would have been able to debate Joe. Fine. So now we have these debates about whose town hall is right and what to watch.  It's going to be a hornet's nest in Miami with the president they are going to stack the deck. They got caught stacking the deck with so-called independent undecided voters last time they are going to do it again and that's fine the president will be able to handle himself. But Steve Scully he lied to everybody he lied to colleagues here at Fox. PERINO: Yes. WATTERS: He had people vouching for him on Twitter friends of his that have been working in the business for many many years.  PERINO: And to his company you know and he lost his job. WATTERS: He lied to his boss and his credibility is shot. To be able to say that yes I got hacked and to think you could pull that off in 2020?  PERINO: Well I mean look Joy Reid -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: That guy -- PERINO: Joy Reid succeeded. WATTERS: -- who made that decision was moderating a presidential debate that should scare you.  PERINO: I mean Joy Reid succeeded. GUTFELD: And not suspended. PERINO: Right. GUTFELD: She wasn't suspended. PERINO: No she got promoted. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: Emily there is also such a thing as a recording device called a DVR which you should always DVR and record The Five. I mean if people want to watch both town halls they could record one.  COMPAGNO: Right. It doesn't vanish forever. I think it's interesting that according to the president NBC called him. According to NBC Don Lemon and everyone else this was the president's machination and it's always all his fault.  And I also it's interesting that a lot of people for example a prominent actor saying this is an echo chamber of misinformation but no I thought it was a town hall. And that goes to your point and your point about how if town halls are how they are for Biden then absolutely it's an echo chamber and a pleasant place to be but that's not how they are supposed to be. They are actually supposed to be thoughtful questions that elicit thoughtful answers. So the notion that this is somehow taking away from the American people learning more about candidate President Trump in this arena is just false.  PERINO: How are you going to watch both Juan?  WILLIAMS: I might flip back and forth if the baseball game just poke.  WATTERS: Juan is watching baseball. COMPAGNO: I think it's less -- WILLIAMS: But I am a little bit puzzled by what I'm hearing here because as I recall it was President Trump who pulled out of the debate.  WATTERS: Because it was virtual. WILLIAMS: All right. But it was President Trump who chose not to debate tonight.  WATTERS: Because that favors Biden. WILLIAMS: No no. No it doesn't.  WATTERS: A virtual does. WILLIAMS: It does not. WATTERS: Yes it does. WILLIAMS: It's a debate. In other words you would just you say the town hall format favors Biden? I don't think so. I think in fact they went out there. They went -- they got Gallup to select people based on undecided there aren't that many undecideds in the country. But that's totally fair. And the second thing I just find again puzzling that I'm hearing on the set is that somehow Steve Scully is biased because he's talking to Anthony Scaramucci who was hired and worked and as a friend of President Trump until he -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: You really think that that would be -- WILLIAMS: But the point is that all of us know you call anyone in the universe for ideas Scully was being attacked twice by name by the president he's talking -- and now the mistake was that Scully lied about it.  GUTFELD: He lied. WILLIAMS: That I'll say and I think Steve Scully is a terrific guy I've known him for a long time. I'm just that he put himself in that position that was his error and now he's apologized. But to suggest that he is somehow biased? You should watch this thing.  PERINO: Well it might be a good thing that Twitter wrote his death sentence yesterday good thing for all of us maybe. GUTFELD: Get off Twitter. PERINO: Coming up next the Biden campaign is warning supporters that the race it's a lot closer than people realize.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: We are just 19 days away from the big November election day and voter enthusiasm is off the charts. Seventeen million Americans have already cast ballots. Democrats appear to hold the edge in early voting but the Biden campaign is still worried that there's going to be a tight race.  The campaign manager tweeting and here I'm quoting. ""There is still a long way to go in this campaign and we think this race is far closer than folks on this web site thing. Like a lot closer."" So Jesse is this what Dana and I called bedwetting Democrats is Jennifer O'Malley Dillon sending the right message avoid complacency?  WATTERS: You guys are going to lose. And you can just look at the numbers in Florida. You haven't hit your numbers. Its Florida registration deadline is over and they are underperforming big time. Also you say that they are leading an early mail-in voting. Not in Ohio Wisconsin and Michigan. It's tied. And actually Republicans are over performing Democrats in Michigan when it comes to mail-in vote. That just means that Democrats are just cannibalizing their election day voting. I don't see all of these mail-in votes as a sign of enthusiasm for Democrats. I see it as a sign of fear for going into the polls and potentially catching coronavirus and that's on them. Fauci said it was totally fine.  This week we are going to look back on this week and see that this is the week that change the dynamic in the campaign. Trump recovered from the virus went back out and started doing rallies again Barrett is sailing through and big tech is interfering and suppressing the vote.  The Republican base is very energized. Gallup says the majority of the American people think Trump is going to win they say that they are better off than they were four years ago. And he's doing rallies. The last rally he had half of the people weren't even Republicans. They were a combination of independents Democrats and new voters.  Things are looking very good for the Trump campaign. Trump campaign is very happy about what they are seeing and I think the Democrats should be scared.  WILLIAMS: Wow I don't know what you're drinking but it's good. WATTERS: All right. I'll give some after the show. WILLIAMS: So Greg -- Greg Democratic turnout it looks like it's through the roof in this early process. The Wall Street Journal has Biden up by 11.  What do you think? GUTFELD: Well I don't know. Whatever happens I'm going to tell you I'll be watching Tucker tonight. Because I hear he has a treasure trove of new Hunter Biden e-mails and I can't wait. I'm not even watching the town halls. Screw that. I'm watching Tucker 8:00 Fox News.  I want this to be decisive. And I know this sounds very selfish on my part because it's like -- if Biden wins I want it to be huge and if Trump wins I want it to be huge because I don't want my neighborhood destroyed.  And L.A. -- and the NYPD are already talking about what they're going to have to deal with. And it sounds like it's going to be a hell of a lot worse than what we saw in June. And there's not much they can do about it.  And I just feel that if it's something that -- if the more indecisive or murky the results are the worst it's going to be for this city and for a lot of cities because for some reason it's not the voter. I love voter enthusiasm. I think it's great. It's the instant -- it's the mental anguish and instability that we seem to just say OK it's OK to go out on the street because you feel bad and break prop break things and break people's heads and just these public tantrums that we somehow approve of that's what bothers me. Go out and vote but leave me the hell alone.  WILLIAMS: All right. So Emily everyone I think assume that President Obama was going to come out in the final stretch. So what's the surprise here? COMPAGNO: I don't think it's a surprise. I think what was probably surprising and more telling was his silence throughout the whole beginning and of course the notion that he actually told Joe Biden not to run. I will say though that the messaging from his campaign it's to be expected frankly right.  I think if voters feel it's going to be a blowout then they might stay at home. So it behooves them to encourage voters to get out there and break a certain tie. But I think it's accurate. And most importantly -- so we know that the final state polls out of 2016 were obviously inaccurate but especially in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania had Clinton ahead Trump won all three.  And to your point about how Wisconsin and Michigan early voting is actually shows the Republicans ahead right now Public Policy shows polls show Biden ahead. Clearly the Trump voters are being undercounted and given that in those states especially white over the age of 30 non-college educated voters those registrations have risen by 10 percent and the Democratic margin have decreased by 10 percent to just six points. All of those are what is telling.  WILLIAMS: Well let me pick up on that with you Dana. GOP says they're registering -- it looks like they're registering more new voters likely to vote. But Karl Rove today our friend in the Wall Street Journal said last time Trump got an inside straight. This time he's going to need a royal flush. PERINO: I know that was a great quote that he had there. And he said that you know there's not a lot of time. But I actually was able to ask Karl today about those new registered voters and I think that Republicans if you're looking for silver linings outside of some of the polls that you might see it is the new registered voters. There's like over a million or something out there. And that -- remember President Trump won Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania by very slim margins. If you add a million voters to the rolls and those key battleground states then you're going to have a lot more question because a newly registered voter is 99 percent likely to vote that year. WILLIAMS: All right. Ahead Democrats continue to criticize Judge Amy Coney Barrett and the Supreme Court confirmation process. We're going to talk about that next right here on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: Judge Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation to the Supreme Court is just about a done deal. But that's not stopping Democrats from whining about the process.  SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT): This process is a caricature of illegitimacy. SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA): It's going to create a lot of bad will that doesn't need to be created. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): I believe that this rush sham process is a disservice to our committee. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): This is a sham. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): I don't know how we get this train back on the track. But this nomination at this moment in time is not usual not normal and it's beneath the dignity of this committee. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: I'll go to you first Dana. And I hope the massage you had was quite therapeutic. PERINO: Yes the commercial break massages are really good.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: I get that in your contract next time. GUTFELD: Yes OK. So when I see this I go like OK haven't we completely destroyed the liberal embrace of diversity? Remember whenever it's a woman that is being nominated for everything it's you go girl unless it's not their woman.  PERINO: She'll never be on the cover of Elle Magazine.  GUTFELD: Exactly. So the whole thing about gender thing just goes out the window. So isn't the whole gender issue just a big lie to get --  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: Thank you very much. I rest my case. PERINO: Can I make another point though?  GUTFELD: Yes you can.  PERINO: So I think that one of the things we're looking at is that this confirmation looks like it's going so smoothly right especially as compared to Kavanaugh. Remember when the Kavanagh stuff come up after this process like at this point like over the next few days or the counter process that's when something came up.  I have no indication. I don't believe they're going to do anything like that. But just look don't sleep on it that might happen. The other thing is that a lot of their outrageousness was already out there. It just became white noise. And I just wanted to point out two examples for example. So in the Bork hearings remember Ted Kennedy speech in which he said that Bork would lead to back-alley abortion segregated lunch tables and midnight police raids. In this case because I guess maybe people are just desensitized to this stuff Cory Booker the senator from New Jersey argued that Justice Barrett -- that women who have miscarriages could be subject to investigation to ensure they hadn't had an abortion. This is the speech that he gives on the floor. It's egregious. It's inflammatory.  But Richard Blumenthal also says that in vitro fertilization could be criminalized under Judge Barrett even though she says there's nothing in her record history or public statements to suggest that's even remotely possible. So I think we are well past Bork. And I agree with them -- I don't agree with them that it's a sham. When Dick Durbin says how do we get this all back on track? I mean two -- you got to have two to tango here.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: And that kind of language is not going to help. GUTFELD: Excellent analogy with the tango. Emily have you been watching the hearings? And what is your impression of this as a lawyer? COMPAGNO: I have so many thoughts on this. GUTFELD: Keep it two or few.  COMPAGNO: So I will start with how the Washington Post phrase her general pattern of evasiveness right which is actually just deference and respect for ongoing cases or political issues or a refusal to go down those hypothetical traps that the senators keep trying to lay out before her. We have to intellectually acknowledge that if she would have comment on a hypo and then was confirmed and before her a case came with one of those issues half the country would clam her for a certain result and she'd have to recuse herself obviously.  And the notion that you know that a judge is neutral and objective that's what is before them is a closed universe. That's how they remain neutral and objective. And that's why all of these senators attempts to find the chimps in our armor and these decisions why they kept failing. So they kept -- they refused to parse out merit issues for procedural and ministerial and whether the plaintiff met the burden. So when Senator Coons was talking which I could barely tolerate listening to and he said that she would be a Justice Barrett would be a judicial activist and originalist is the opposite and Senator Klobuchar proved that point when she brought up Justice Thomas's opinion or it was a concurring opinion in the defamation case with Bill Cosby. And it was basically she thought it was restricting freedom of the press or whatever.  But his point was look the Constitution doesn't make up a public -- an actual malice standard so why should we. They are about deconstructing judicial tests and creations not constructing them.  And final quick point t fastest most nimble way for social change or protecting and safeguarding minority rights is through legislation. So all of this misguided responsibility these guys keep placing on a judge's shoulders to do it it's so misplaced. And all of these expert testimonies crystal good it will -- lives will depend on it. No it doesn't. But it's good she was saying it in front of the lawmakers because that's who needs to hear it.  GUTFELD: It's like Perry Mason in a pink dress Juan.  COMPAGNO: Yes.  WILLIAMS: Our own Perry Mason. Look I don't think -- the bottom line in my mind nobody watching this process thinks this has been fair thorough and considered for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.  WATTERS: Here's one.  WILLIAMS: Yes I don't think there's a soul in America. This woman is so evasive. She won't even say that it's -- a legitimate transfer of power is to be respected by the President.  GUTFELD: She's great.  WILLIAMS: And as to Dana's point about it takes two to tango yes. So maybe you should have tangoed with Merrick Garland. Maybe you shouldn't have played that game and skewed it so badly that people now say this is just a brutal act of political terror. That's what it's going on. And they've undermined credibility not only in the process but in the Supreme Court that's damaging parliamentary process.  PERINO: If Hillary Clinton had won that election everybody would be saying that Mitch McConnell made the biggest mistake of his political career.  WILLIAMS: What's the -- yes he made -- he made a mistake way back when by undermining a legitimate nominee of a twice-elected president.  PERINO: No well --  GUTFELD: Jesse. Mitt Romney endorsing her.  WATTERS: That's good. Juan said it was a brutal act of political terror.  WILLIAMS: Yes. WATTERS: Juan only I'm allowed to talk like that.  WILLIAMS: I'm sorry man. WATTERS: No listen. After the -- after the Kavanaugh bloodbath this was a bubble bath.  GUTFELD: Right. WATTERS: I do give Democrats some credit here. They were pretty professional. It wasn't lots of attacks against religion. They conducted themselves well. But I didn't like being lectured by the guy that lied about being in Vietnam or the senator that drove around with a Chinese fighter and limo for 20 years. Save it OK. Save it.  GUTFELD: All right speaking of saving up next Dr. Anthony Fauci out with a major warning about Thanksgiving. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COMPAGNO: Welcome back. Top health officials want you to cancel your Thanksgiving plans. The CDC reportedly warning that small household gatherings could be fueling the spread of COVID-19. And watch what Dr.  Anthony Fauci is saying. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI DIRECTOR NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: You have to bite the bullet and sacrifice that social gathering unless you're pretty certain that the people that you're dealing with are not infected. (END VIDEO CLIP) COMPAGNO: All right Greg is this devastating for families or awesome?  GUTFELD: I think it's a mixture of both. First people that have always lived far away. I always was -- it was a big hassle. But it this is a reminder that how much you can give up if you're not thinking about things.  And I mean -- I mean like volunteering and wearing a mask is an important thing. But there's a lot of things that we're just kind of like giving up and going OK that's cool. You know maybe we'll get maybe we'll do Christmas. But then we get around Christmas and then no you're not going to do that.  You know my brother in law passed away last Thursday and three older sisters. Nope there's going to be no funeral. I'm not going to complain about it because there are thousands of people who missed out on funerals of their loved ones. And it's like -- but you just kind of go OK pick up the urn. That's what you do. It's great. I mean we have to start thinking about what as a country are we willing to give up. WATTERS: Well if Fauci comes for Christmas he's going to have a problem with me. War on Christmas is very serious thing. I will watch that war has already gone after Easter. You know he now he's going for Thanksgiving.  Juan will be celebrating it with his family with his grandchildren. My parents will be there.  GUTFELD: In matching sweatpants.  WATTERS: And that'll be one more thing on Black Friday. And -- right you're not going to keep families apart from each other. I get it but enough. I understand cases arising for two reasons. One we use it last month 700000 a month. We just now are over a million a month in testing.  Also people are going back to work. They're going about their lives.  You're going to games you're going to schools you're going to see the cases go up but the deaths have remained below 1000 daily deaths since August and that's a good thing with the vaccine around the corner. COMPAGNO: Dana quick question for you. Greg mentioned volunteering. So I'm worried about the underserved communities that usually can look forward to this you know swell of help and assistance on Thanksgiving. So is this going to be detrimental for those guys?  PERINO: You know I'm not thinking too far ahead about Thanksgiving because I was hoping that we would have one of those rapid tests available by Thanksgiving that would be affordable that everybody in the family could take in the morning and everybody could feel very comfortable. I mean some of them exist but it's the -- you know the price point might not be what you would want and the availability. I would tell you I am pretty even keeled person. I have a lot of anxiety about the economy a lot. I'm actually frightened because Congress is now going to go campaign the President's team has basically said there's nothing more we can do here on a COVID relief bill. They might try to do one in the lame duck. That means December. But you have people eight million more people now under the poverty line. You have people that are on food stamps now that through no fault of their own they lost their jobs and their pride is hurt. And I don't see anybody doing anything to get businesses back.  And these business owners his restaurants have tried so hard to do it outside. It's going to get cold and people aren't going to be outside with the rain. And I actually I'm scared for the first time in a long time. I'm worried about the economy and I really wish that Congress and the President could get together and get it done.  COMPAGNO: Amen. Juan what are your thoughts? WILLIAMS: Well I just don't think that anybody is taking anything away from any of us. I think in fact we have to be concerned especially if Thanksgiving means you're getting together with elderly parents or grandparents. You don't want to put people at risk unnecessarily.  And what I see is that the numbers in Europe are now rising to the point they're talking about the second wave and numbers are rising in this country in terms of infection even going to the ballgame you know Nick Saban? I mean you know you see they're canceling games now.  So I just -- I think we should not cast it as oh someone's forcing you to do something rather than someone's looking out for you. COMPAGNO: All right ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" I'll go first.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TROY AIKMAN FOX NEWS NFL ANALYST: This is one of those games Maria that you expect it to have some playoff implications. I know the Green Bay will be in the postseason every expectation that the Tampa Bay will as well.  So for just be in week six in the NFL there's a lot on the line. (END VIDEO CLIP) COMPAGNO: Tune into America's Game of the Week this Sunday at 4:25 E.T. on Fox. My money is squarely on the Packers by the way.  (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: You think so? COMPAGNO: Yes.  WATTERS: You'll take the -- I'll go to the other side.  COMPAGNO: Great. WATTERS: Yes I'll go to the Bucks.  COMPAGNO: It's always anyone but Tom Brady for me. WATTERS: OK well that sounds like a personal thing.  COMPAGNO: No it's not. It's a Brady thing. Whatever. WATTERS: Dana? PERINO: I want to give a big congratulations to a really lovely couple that got married last weekend Emily Landers and Alex Stergiou. They got married and the most beautiful Orthodox Greek ceremony. It was actually chanted in Greek Greg.  GUTFELD: Wow.  PERINO: It's all Greek to you. GUTFELD: Everything is Greek to me.  PERINO: The reception was in a barn on a 100-acre private farm. Congrats to Emily and Alex and to the Landers family two weddings in a year of Coronavirus. Congratulations.  GUTFELD: We have more about the Landers please. WATTERS: Are you guys related? PERINO: We're not related. But I also want to give a very big shout out to a good friend a good family friend Joey Johnson in Thermopolis Wyoming.  That is Jesse Thermopolis.  WATTERS: Thermopolis.  PERINO: I bet you're all watching out there and you're just in my thoughts. WATTERS: Joey Johnson in Thermopolis. Juan? WILLIAMS: All right Jessie this opening is for you. It's a bird it's a plane no it's a giant vulture. Take a look at this vulture as it guides paragliders through the mountains of southern Spain. As you see the vulture is leading them on the best airstream for a smooth flight through the mountains.  You should know the bird has been trained to do this. British paraglider instructor Scott Mason calls it para-hawking. The bird is rewarded with meat. Para-hawking now a tourist attraction in Asia parts of Europe. The whole thing reminds me Jesse of a movie Avatar in which the heroes rode birds into Combat. I did this at an amusement park with the grandkids before the virus.  PERINO: Would you do that? GUTFELD: No the upside of this is if they crash the bird eats you.  WILLIAMS: Free meat free meat.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

310,'The Five' react to social media censorship of Hunter Biden report," Oct. 15 2020 – This is a rush transcript from “Your World with Neil Cavuto” October 15 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. NEIL CAVUTO FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Talk about weird timing. Tonight dual town halls featuring Joe Biden speaking with ABC in Philadelphia the president of the United States with NBC in Florida.  And if the date and timing seems odd it should. This was to be the night there was going to be a town hall forum featuring the president of the United States and Joe Biden and Steve Scully C-SPAN was going to be moderating it. Here's the thing. The debate is off. Steve Scully is out.  And a lot of people are wondering what comes next.  Welcome everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto and this is ""Your World."" First to John Roberts on these fast-moving developments on a busy night of campaigning and selling the message -- John. JOHN ROBERTS FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: And Neil good afternoon to you.  Maybe it is a good thing that the presidential debate for tonight was canceled by the Commission on Presidential Debates because if this news had broken at 4:00 when there was about to be a debate in five hours it would have thrown everything up in the air.  I had checked with Steve Scully myself -- I have known Steve for a long long time -- last week just to say hey just wanted to check to make sure that these reports you were hacked are indeed accurate. And he said yes that's correct. So he was not truthful to me either.  So what we're going to have tonight is two competing town halls instead of the single town hall debate under the auspices of the Commission on Presidential Debates. And who knows by the way what the future of that entire organization and the next debate on the 22nd is going to be. Donald Trump will be in Miami and he will be on NBC. And Joe Biden will be in Philadelphia. He will be on ABC. Both of these are at 8:00 tonight which is interesting that they will be competing with each other which means that voters won't get a chance to see them obviously not side by side but they won't even be able to watch one and then the other. And the ultimate tale may be told Neil in the ratings that come from this. President Trump continuing earlier today to go after Joe Biden and Hunter Biden over the reports of the e-mails that suggested that Hunter Biden had arranged or was in the process of arranging some sort of meeting between a Ukrainian energy executive and his father. President Trump saying that despite attempts by Twitter and Facebook to limit access or outright censor these reports that he's going to go ahead and keep saying what he's saying. Listen to what he said in Greenville earlier today.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is a corrupt politician.  Just remember it. And I'm going to say it more and more and Facebook and all can try and shut us down. But you know what? Everybody knows it.  You don't have a kid who gets thrown out of the military hasn't got a job for a long time. His father becomes the vice president. And now this kid's going into every country walking away with millions of dollars.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  ROBERTS: President Trump has been campaigning to repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which shields social media companies from any kind of legal action if they do engage in censorship. The president again going to that well today. Listen here.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Don't forget big tech got something years ago that let them become big tech. They got total protection. They don't get sued. They don't get anything. We're going to take away their Section 230 unless they shape up.  (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: And it looks like something may be moving on that front as well.  The Associated Press reporting just a few minutes ago that the FCC commissioner Ajit Pai is making some moves to go down the road of doing something about Section 230. Trying to get more details on that Neil. We will let as we get them.  CAVUTO: Yes I do know that Congress is going to haul the CEOs for an important hearing on this.  ROBERTS: Yes next week. CAVUTO: Presumably this was the trigger.  John I'm curious too. The White House has always been very skeptical and leery of the means by which moderators are chosen for these debates. This issue with Steve Scully this could fuel that argument all the more.  ROBERTS: Yes it really could.  And again Neil it's a good thing that this debate was canceled because I can't imagine the storm of cow feces that would be swirling right now if this news were to have broken five hours before the debate. I mean this has been a year of incredible things. And that would have just been another one of those incredible things on top of it.  Now the third debate coming up on the 22nd is being moderated by Kristen Welker. I know her well. She's a personal friend of mine. She is a top-rate journalist.  And if I were Kristen I mean I would have to -- to be honest with you I would wonder if I had done the right thing by accepting the invitation to be a moderator. But I know Kristen will do the job to the best of her ability.  CAVUTO: All right and a week away from that one. John Roberts thank you very very much. Again we're not hearing much from either campaign right now on the Scully news and what this says about moderators going forward or even the process by which we select moderators for these big debates.  So Jacqui Heinrich with the Biden campaign right now. Jacqui have they had any response among Biden's folks or the former vice president itself to what happened to Mr. Scully?  JACQUI HEINRICH FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: You know Neil I actually haven't had a chance even to ask that question yet. I certainly will. And we will get that right to you as soon as I know.  In the meantime Joe Biden I know tested negative for coronavirus today.  He will appear here at the Constitution Center behind me in just a couple of hours.  Meantime though his running mate Senator Kamala Harris is sidelined from the campaign after two individuals associated with it tested positive for the virus. The campaign says Harris has not been in contact with either of those people in the last two days so she does not need to quarantine but out of an abundance of caution she's canceling all in-person events until October 19.  Just last night on MSNBC Harris was praising the safety measures adopted by the campaign.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RACHEL MADDOW HOST ""THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW"": Do you feel safe campaigning during COVID?  SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well we have been very safe. I like to hug people. You don't hug people these days. That's not adoption. You can't shake hands. But you can look people in the eye and you can listen and you can be there.  (END VIDEO CLIP) HEINRICH: Harris pledged today she will be transparent about any test results she received. She tested negative yesterday. She's being tested again today. She also reminded folks to wear masks and follow social distancing.  Meantime Joe Biden today pushing back on misinformation after that bombshell New York Post article raised questions about Hunter Biden's dealings in Ukraine and whether he used his father as political leverage.  Biden said in a fund-raiser he expects the opposition to throw everything at him but the kitchen sink including lies and distortion.  He also weighed in on the power of technology saying it leaves people to sort through what is true and untrue saying that that takes time.  And tonight Joe Biden will take questions in this town hall from 21 voters. We will see what kind of questions he -- asks and if any pertain to this bombshell report Neil.  CAVUTO: To that point Jacqui has the former vice president flatly denied the allegations in this New York Post story that his son had e-mail exchanges and set up meetings with then Burisma top officials and the former vice president? Has he denied all of that or just called it an offensive story? HEINRICH: He has flatly denied that any meeting took place.  The campaign says that the former vice president's official schedule proves that. However they have not spoken to the validity of those e-mails. Of course that's a question we're all trying to sort out is figuring out the chain of custody... CAVUTO: Right.  HEINRICH: ... whether they were potentially compromised e-mails or if they are legitimate questions that still remain Neil.  CAVUTO: All right Jacqui thank you very very much Jacqui Heinrich on that. So much about this New York Post story we don't know.  Here's what we do. Social media didn't waste any time trying to prevent it getting passed on. That does not mean that Twitter and the likes of Facebook had it on their sites. They made it very difficult if not impossible for people to retweet or resend that to others.  And therein lies the rub. Who are they to decide what is worthy for people to read and follow? And then who are we in that process?  Matthew Whitaker a former acting attorney general with us right now  Matthew I think that's kind of the bigger question here. Whatever you think of the details of this story these social media giants and others took it upon themselves to say we don't think this is wise for you to pass on.  That's -- that's a little Big Brother-ish there. What do you make of that?  MATTHEW WHITAKER FORMER ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Yes it is a little Big Brother-ish. And I think this is a -- the reason this is -- has so much interest from a lot of folks is because not only of what happened and what this story contained from The New York Post but really it is the best example we have seen to date of the power of Facebook and Twitter to put their thumb on the scale to change how much can be shared among users on their platforms.  And I think it shows the power of their monopoly -- monopoly Neil. And I think -- I think this is going to get them some regulation attention from Washington D.C. CAVUTO: You know the story very well.  And you know about -- and I understand some of the confusion and maybe skepticism around this computer store owner and why he had this laptop. Was it indeed Hunter Biden's laptop? Why he made it a point to make a couple of copies of these e-mail exchanges pass one along to Rudy Giuliani. Be that as it may the social media that generally happily allows all sorts of material skeptical and otherwise to pass on strictly forbid this and made it next to impossible for anyone to communicate it.  Others found ways around that getting it to colleagues or those they knew.  But let's say Facebook and Twitter certainly didn't help.  Did they break any laws here doing this?  WHITAKER: Yes Neil and that's a good point is that what Facebook and Twitter did was essentially instead of answering speech with more speech or sort of entering a marketplace of ideas is they suppressed speech and showed kind of the worst of the power of their platforms.  I just -- I just can't see -- we already had Clarence Thomas drop a footnote in a cert petition denial saying that he would be interested in taking a 230 case. We now have Congress calling these people up for hearings on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. And we also have the FCC now talking about this.  And I think ultimately we may look back at this as the golden age of social media before Washington D.C. heavily regulated them.  CAVUTO: I'm just wondering too would the better part of valor be even with the risk of sending along information that might be false or even crazy... WHITAKER: Yes.  CAVUTO: ... is it the social media giants' job to decide that? Or should we as users of these sites be well aware read what you can and will decide for yourself?  WHITAKER: Well Neil we have always trusted the American people to be discerning. The New York Post is not some fringe publication that doesn't have journalistic standards. And what they put out it seems to me would have been -- they would have gone through their process to determine if it's fit to print.  And it's not just the major media outlets like The Times and The Post that somehow have a monopoly on what's true. And so I think this whole case is a really sad example of the power of social media and how ultimately they're going to deserve the regulation they get from Congress and from the executive branch.  CAVUTO: All right thank you Matt very very much.  WHITAKER: Thank you Neil.  CAVUTO: And to that point Congress wants to hold hearings with all these honchos including Mr. Dorsey of Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg. We're also hearing from the president on this whole Steve Scully news saying that: ""I was right again. Steve Scully just admitted he was lying about his Twitter being hacked. The debate was rigged. He was suspended indefinitely. The Trump campaign was not treated fairly by the commission.  Did I show good instincts in being the first to know?"" Of course the president not part of that debate tonight that was scheduled for tonight. Neither is Joe Biden. They're holding separate town hall forums.  But this is calling into question how these things these debates are done in the first place. Who makes the decision what is an upright and decent moderator and who is not?  The curtain now has been open and a lot of people don't like what they're seeing.  Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CAVUTO: Does this seem right to you just hearing what you have heard about it and how the social media played it?  BRENDAN CARR FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION: No not at all.  Look the cover-up can oftentimes draw more attention than the crime. And by silencing core political speech on this important story I think big tech has crossed a line.  (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: All right that's FCC commissioner Carr with me on FOX Business telling essentially that it's just probably a bad business strategy if nothing else to draw more attention to an article you might deem unacceptable or let's say controversial than you would this way. And that's where we stand right now where they're already questioning whether Twitter and Facebook made a big deal out of something simply because they didn't believe it or found it suspicious. We're talking of course about that New York Post article that goes into detail about e-mail exchanges allegedly involving Hunter Biden with a top executive over Burisma the Ukrainian energy concern with whom he was trying to grant an audience with then Vice President Joe Biden. Edward Lawrence a lot more now on the details behind this and how it is going way beyond the story to those that wouldn't pass along the story -- Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And that's it Neil is the story has now grown beyond itself and the details.  What really set off Republicans is when Twitter suspended the account for The New York Post. Senator Ted Cruz says blocking this story amounts to a campaign contribution for Biden.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Big tech censorship has always been bad. But they really crossed a line in the last 24 hours. I'm not aware of their previously actively censoring major press outlets.  It's not -- it's not really any different than Twitter blocking FOX News from sending out a story. Look FOX News may be right or wrong. The New York Post may be right or wrong but silencing the media is a direct violation of the principles of the First Amendment.  (END VIDEO CLIP) LAWRENCE: Now Twitter says that the story violates its policy because it gives e-mail addresses and could have been hacked materials.  Well today Rudy Giuliani claims that he has a legal chain of custody for Hunter Biden's laptop that makes it the repairman's custody or property.  Now on that laptop The New York Post says are e-mails showing former Vice President Joe Biden possibly met with Ukrainian business associate of Hunter Biden. Now the former vice president previously had said he never met any of his son's business associates.  The New York Post also says that there are e-mails detailing how a deal with the Chinese businessman with ties possibly to the Chinese military would be -- quote -- ""interesting for me and my family"" according to an e- mail The New York Post has from Hunter Biden. Now the president Donald Trump highlighting censorship at his campaign stop in Greenville North Carolina something Senator Mike Lee also pointed to.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): You have had news media outlets and you have had social media platforms in the past who have been willing to run all sorts of stuff just based on somebody's suggestion that they might be true.  Now I just want to see them applying the same standard here that they have applied elsewhere. And clearly we're not having the same standards.  (END VIDEO CLIP) LAWRENCE: And Twitter says the suspensions of the accounts will be removed when the tweets in question are deleted.  So The New York Post would have to delete the tweets with its own stories in them -- back to you Neil.  CAVUTO: Edward Lawrence thank you very very much.  What a confusing day for political back-and-forths on this. No doubt they will become subjects of separate town hall debates featuring the former vice president and of course the president of the United States.  But the president has already weighed in on one big matter today Steve Scully out at C-SPAN at least indefinitely over misrepresenting a Twitter hack on him that was no hack. It was him. Kennedy here on all of this. Kennedy what do you think?  KENNEDY FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: I think it's Weiner-ific.  I think it's so reminiscent of Anthony Weiner it's actually kind of sickening and not a surprise. Anyone who saw the tweets that Steve Scully tried to send to Anthony Scaramucci another shamed Anthony you knew that he was trying to send a direct message which is something that is sent in private not to the entire world.  But apparently Steve Scully is 100 and doesn't know how Twitter works.  Therefore his account should be frozen. I can't stand when people do something dumb and they don't take responsibility for it.  He can say I'm a ham-fisted grandpa and I don't know what I'm doing. But instead he's like oh what I was hacked.  Steve if someone were going to hack your account believe me they would post something either pornographic or interesting. They wouldn't post that. CAVUTO: Well I don't know what the details how they found out that wasn't the case. He did admit that that indeed was not the case that he was not hacked.  But it does come back to this issue of how are moderators decided in the first place? We know campaigns typically sort of have a list of people they keep in mind or would like to see and that this independent commission decides for itself.  It's divided between Republicans and Democrats. But the rap against it is that they have a tin ear and are very biased. I don't know where you stand on this. But at the very least it's going to make us revisit how they go about choosing who moderates these things or who's involved in them.  What do you think?  KENNEDY: Yes I think that we should absolutely take a long look at how these debates are refereed because frankly I don't trust the commission.  And I think that the commission is there working with a stale duopoly that is the Republican and Democrat parties to ensure that theirs are the only candidates that the nation sees. And that does a great disservice. And it really limits the dialogue.  And these candidates don't have to be pressed if there are areas of agreement. And the one thing that the first debate showed us it's that presidential debates can really go off the rails quite quickly and be somewhat entertaining. But also maybe we need a different format and a different way of putting these things together. Chris Wallace did an outstanding job. Steve Scully his reputation is sullied.  In fact they may think up a new adjective. It could be Scullied. Now that would be a verb.  CAVUTO: Really? You just said that. You actually just said that.  Kennedy thank you very very much.  We just don't know. We do know that this was to be the night that Steve was going to be hosting this debate this town hall forum that now isn't happening.  All right when we come back here of course the judge got a break today.  She was not part of this fourth day of hearings going on right now where they largely had senators listening to witnesses who spoke on her behalf and others who had questions and reservations. But the timetable is on. They think right now they can get a committee vote going on October 22 and the very next day a full Senate vote on October 23 long before the election -- after this.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  CAVUTO: Could Judge Amy Barrett be on her way to the Supreme Court in eight days? The aggressive timeline that Republicans have set up to make sure she does -- right after this.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  CAVUTO: Well Amy Barrett has taken their best of questions. And today she had the day off as the Senate Judiciary Committee was more talking to those who either supported her or knew a lot about her but right now that train has not slowed one bit.  In fact it seems like things are speeding up amid reports they want to have a full committee vote by October 22. That would be a week from today and maybe a full Senate vote the day after that.  Hillary Vaughn on the latest in that aggressive timetable.  Hey Hillary.  HILLARY VAUGHN FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey Neil well Senate Democrats tried today to delay a vote on Judge Barrett's nomination until after Election Day.  But their effort to do that this morning ultimately failed. So Senate Republicans are on track to vote on Judge Barrett's nomination out of committee one week from today.  But even though Judge Barrett over the past two days endured about 20 hours of cross-examination some Democrats say they have been left with more questions than answers. And today Judge Barrett while she was not in the hearing room witnesses testified on her behalf. The American Bar Association told the committee that Barrett was well-qualified while Democrats called witnesses that put a face on policies that they think are in jeopardy with a potential Justice Barrett on the high court.  While Judge Barrett has been very persistent in trying to stay apolitical throughout this process some Democrats argue that the timing of her nomination just a few weeks before Election Day turns this into -- quote -- ""a callous power grab."" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT): President Trump has always wanted to say the quiet part out loud often very loudly.  He said he expects his nominee to side with him in any election-related dispute.  SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): They have become accustomed to the Supreme Court being policy-makers and being a body that bails them out if they can't win the election or win a vote.  (END VIDEO CLIP) VAUGHN: Some Democrats are already now plotting political payback.  Sheldon -- Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said today that if Democrats take control of the Senate and the shoe is on the other foot that Republicans will not have a leg to stand on it they object to controversial but constitutional moves like expanding the Supreme Court adding seats to the court or getting rid of the filibuster -- Neil.  CAVUTO: All right Hillary Vaughn thank you very very much.  So can anything be done right now too slow or even remotely dry to stop Judge Barrett from becoming the next associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court?  Let's go to John Yoo. Love having John on the former deputy assistant attorney general bestselling author of ""Defender in Chief"" much much more.  So John I'm not aware of the mechanics of this process and what Democrats might be able to do even in the minority to stall it. But what do you think? What tricks could they have up their sleeves to stop it?  JOHN YOO FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well I would feel bad if you didn't know the ins and outs of the Senate floor manual rules.  But what the senators could do what the Democrats could do is try to just not show up and hope that some Republican senators are so sick they can't form what's called a quorum.  The Constitution requires that there be a quorum to have the vote. And under the Senate rules that's a majority. And they have to show up in- person the floor of the Senate to take that vote. There's no voting by proxy in the U.S. senate like there is in the House.  So -- but if everybody shows up you got a majority of 51 senators who show up to vote I don't think there's really anything that the Democratic senators can do to stop the floor vote from being a week from today.  And then the oath of office can be taken right after President Trump signs her commission. She could be sitting on the bench a week from tomorrow.  CAVUTO: Just amazing.  Have we ever had -- if it sticks to that script John but have we ever had something so quick in the choosing the hearings and the ultimate swearing-in of an associate justice? YOO: Actually Neil I'd say most justices in American history have been quick. Actually even having hearings is relatively a pretty new thing.  They didn't have really hearings 50 years ago. But even then there have been justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg John Paul Stevens you could go down a few other names who have had very very quick periods between when they were named to when they sat -- until the time they sat on the bench sometimes less than 30 days.  CAVUTO: All right.  Now as you know John the Democrats have vowed because of this and ranting this through as they say Republicans are with this nomination they take the White House and the Senate they're going to pack the court.  They're going to do what Franklin Roosevelt did back in 1937.  Now that boomeranged on FDR you know better than many when even Democrats said no no you have gone one step too far.  But hard to sort of telegraph how Joe Biden is on this that he personally doesn't like the whole packing idea. But again it could be different if Republicans are seen at a disadvantage and Democrats run the table right? YOO: I think that's such an overreaction.  It's such a threat to the independence and integrity of the judiciary to the idea of just filling a current vacancy on the Supreme Court. If Democrats are mad the natural thing they should do is just say next time there's a vacancy when our guy is in charge of the White House and we're in charge of the Senate in the last year we will put that person through in just a few weeks. That would be a fair response.  But to say we're just going to make the courts a tool of politics where we just keep stuffing more and more justices make it 25 make it 30 justices Neil you and I will be on the Supreme Court when we get to 50 justices we will just keep putting more people on until you get the results you want? That's not really what the independence of the courts are about. We need to have justices who are not beholden to whatever party just happens to be in power right now.  And I find it's -- Democrats particularly should care about this because they say they want the courts to defend individual rights against the majority. Well under that plan to pack the courts the courts are just going to rubber-stamp the majority every time.  CAVUTO: All right John I think you do have a better shot of that court pick. It doesn't have to get up to 50. I think even at 15 you would be on that short list. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: John Yoo thank you very very much my friend.  Again that is the aggressive timetable. They still think they can do it.  And gosh darn it looking at the calendar and what they're trying to do it does look like they can barring any -- any surprises.  All right stimulus a big issue on Capitol Hill today the president making very very clear with an interview with Stuart Varney on FOX Business we think we can go even bigger I'm open to going even bigger.  Here's the problem. The Senate Republican leader is not -- after this.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  TRUMP: Go big or go home. I said it yesterday go big or go home. But Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to give anything. She thinks it helps her with the election. And I don't think so. I think it hurts her with the election because everyone knows she's holding it up. We're not holding it up. She's holding it up.  (END AUDIO CLIP) CAVUTO: All right the president blaming Nancy Pelosi for the stuck nature of these stimulus talks. But do keep in mind it was the president tweeted out just junking the talks altogether a little more than a couple of weeks ago and waiting until after the election because he didn't like the lack of progress either side was making. Be that as it may Chad Pergram right now on where this could stand and the latest entrant in the confusion process no less than Mitch McConnell. Chad where do we stand?  CHAD PERGRAM FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right Neil.  Good afternoon.  Well Nancy Pelosi the House speaker she has always wanted to -- quote -- ""go big"" -- $2.2 trillion is what she wants to spend on a coronavirus bill.  She's been talking on a regular basis with Steve Mnuchin the secretary of the Treasury. They're supposed to talk at some point still yet today. Keep in mind that Mnuchin yesterday indicated that he didn't think at this point there was any way that they could get a deal done before the election. And that was echoed by the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell today.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): I don't think so because my members -- that's where the administration is willing to go.  My members think what we laid out a half-trillion dollars highly targeted is the best way they go. We're in discussions going on between the secretary of the Treasury and speaker about a higher amount. That's not what I'm going to put on the floor. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: Late last week Senate Republicans incinerated a $1.8 trillion proposal authored by the secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin.  But on FOX Business the president criticized Mnuchin saying -- quote -- ""He hasn't come home with the bacon."" Republican South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham says he is aware that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell believes the country needs a massive bill to salvage the economy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): There are some policy provisions in the $2.2 trillion package that I think make it ineffective in terms of what we're trying to do. To me it's not a money issue. It's a policy issue. Now a lot of Republicans it's about the money. And I understand the debt. But I think Powell is right. I think a bigger stimulus package would help with the right policy.  (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: Now that bill they're going to put on the Senate floor next week it's not going to go anywhere. It needs 60 votes. It's going to face a filibuster from Democrats. And Neil that will be the final nail in the coffin on coronavirus legislation before the election -- back to you.  CAVUTO: You said it before anyone my friend Chad Pergram following all of that on Capitol Hill right now. You never know. But right now those are the numbers we do know.  All right in the meantime here waiting for the big but separate town hall meetings featuring the president and the vice president. They're going to be miles and miles apart but right now that could also explain the amount of money they're raising.  How is it that Joe Biden is running laps around the president when it comes to raising dough? And does that give him a distinct advantage going into the final weeks?  We're on it -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  CAVUTO: All right the president getting ready for his town hall that will be in Miami tonight and going to do a bit of a fund-raiser there as well.  He could use the dough right now because I don't know if you have seen these numbers on Joe Biden but off a record month he has better than $420 million sitting just ready to be spent in the final few weeks of the campaign. And on the left of your screen by the way the president arriving in Miami. Charlie Gasparino has been keeping tabs on all this. Man oh man I don't think I can ever recall Charlie a challenger to an incumbent president eclipsing the money raised by the incumbent president.  It's wild. What's going on?  CHARLIE GASPARINO FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Yes well it reminds me a little bit of Obama in 2008.  Of course Obama wasn't running against an incumbent president. He was running against the incumbent party in John McCain right? The president back then was George Bush.  But George Bush had a lot of problems as you know and so did the Republican brand at that point. It was just -- we came out of a very unpopular war. He had the financial crisis. And Trump has got some of those -- not exactly the same issues obviously but some major issues to deal with the pandemic his handling of it which has been -- people have been very critical of the economy right now although I think he's done net-net well on the economy and his personal attributes.  People are just -- suburban women are just turned off by his tweeting and his personality. Put all that together and donors particularly big money donors -- and this is Wall Street -- they're just throwing money at Biden right now.  I found a fascinating statistic. Goldman Sachs -- this is just individuals not their PAC money but it will give you a little idea here -- gave something like $170000 to Biden. They gave -- they have given about $11000 to Trump.  That's $11000 -- they gave also $11000 to Michelle Caruso-Cabrera who by the way ran against AOC unsuccessfully. It was an uphill battle.  Goldman gave her literally the same amount of money that they gave the president President Trump. So that's where they're betting.  And the polls tell it all. The polls are saying that Biden is going to wait. Now the polls were wrong in the past as you know Neil. Wall Street has been wrong the last two election cycles we should point out. They went heavily for Mitt Romney because Obama they believe backstabbed them essentially. After supporting him he passed all that financial regulation which particularly at Goldman Sachs hurt their bottom line. Last year last election cycle they went for Hillary. Again they bet wrong.  So remember they're not right they're not wrong all the time. But this time they feel they're on pretty strong ground at least now that the president is not going to win. And the polls are -- remember the polls with Hillary towards the end were tightening.  They're -- we still haven't seen that tightening yet. It may happen and he may pull it out. But Wall Street and the big money donors aren't betting on it. They are quite the opposite. They see a Joe Biden presidency.  And obviously you give money to him because you want to influence him.  They don't want him to do all those tax increases he wants particularly on investors. I think they're crazy because he's going to do it. That's -- if there's one thing I know Joe Biden is going to do is raise taxes.  He's made that clear in meeting after meeting particularly if he gets a Republican -- a Democratic Senate and there's going to be some turbulence in the stock market if that happens.  CAVUTO: Yes.  GASPARINO: I don't care how much Goldman Sachs gives him. They're not going to stop that from happening particularly if the Senate goes Democratic. But that's kind of a snapshot of where we are now. Let's see what happens with the polls in the next couple weeks.  CAVUTO: Your friends do seem like a smarmy slimy bunch though. They just suck up to whoever they think is going to win right?  That's you actually. GASPARINO: Well you -- like they're not my friends. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: OK.  (CROSSTALK)  GASPARINO: You're saying they're my friends. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: OK. OK. All right. Well they pick up the phone when you dial. I mean it's just odd.  I mean all right whatever whatever -- as long as you can sleep at night Charlie. That's all I say.  Thank you. Dr. Gasparino. Always good seeing you.  He is the best in the business. We kid each other.  In the meantime the president arriving in Miami with all these fast- developing moves here.  We do know of at least one debate the last debate that is still on barring any surprises. The one that was scheduled originally for tonight couldn't have even happened because of developments that just happened today. More after this.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right how do you tweet out ""Help""? Because right now Jack Dorsey the head of Twitter Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook well they are going to be corralled right now to Washington for a Senate Commerce Committee hearing. The senators want to know how they go about policing content and seemingly targeting conservative content at that of course on this whole New York Post story dust-up. John Thune the Senate majority whip with us right now sits on the Commerce Committee as well as luck would have it. Senator always good having you.  SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): Thanks Neil.  CAVUTO: I notice you guys didn't waste any time trying to get these chieftains to your committee on this subject.  Is that what you're trying to find out how they decided on this subject to block people from -- from transferring this information to other folks?  THUNE: Yes. And actually we have been at this for a while. We had actually issued a subpoena the Commerce Committee did to get them to come. And they without having had the issue the subpoena actually having to be delivered they agreed to come and testify in front of the committee.  So it's Facebook it's Google and it's Twitter.  And I think it's a conversation we need to have Neil. We need to find out exactly what they are doing in terms of content moderation policies. And when they either suppress or amplify individual users' content certainly this example with The New York Post and their users is an example of why not only the entities like The New York Post but also their users who might link to their Web site need due process. They need to find out why these decisions are being made. And I think that the -- this is a matter of transparency. And it's a matter of accountability to the American people. CAVUTO: Senator I know conservatives are saying they disproportionately target conservative thought. And of late there's been a lot of evidence of that.  But I can remember liberals complaining just a few years ago that Facebook practically paved the way for then candidate Trump to become President Trump because it entertained all sorts of stuff specious and otherwise that got on. So are you worried that you might get what you wish for and that all of a sudden you could be shutting down debate of any sort?  THUNE: Well I think what this points to Neil -- and you have already seen the FCC and Chairman Pai has indicated that they have jurisdiction over Section 230 and they're going to come up with a rule-making to clarify the rules.  CAVUTO: Right.  THUNE: But I also think that Section 230 in the law needs to be reformed honestly. I mean it was a 1996 statute. It was when the Internet was in its infancy.  And we have come a long way from that. And you now have essentially three companies that have virtually monopoly power in their particular space of the market. And I think there has to be some accountability.  Now the Democrats up until now as you pointed out have been interested in that as well. Currently it's Republicans who seem and conservative content that seems to be getting censured.  But I would hope that there would be bipartisan interest in bringing these big companies to account not only because of the monopoly of power but also because of the shield against liability that they have with respect to the way that they moderate content.  And those issues need to be looked at again. And it's time for Congress to have that conversation. CAVUTO: Well what if they don't -- they argue Senator that they're not trying -- I'm sorry sir. They argue that they're really not moderating content. They argue that they never took the story down. They did make it very difficult to reduce its distribution. So therein lies the rub.  But if this were a story that was -- had some specious elements to it concerning let's say the president and they were to do the same thing and hold off people -- letting people resend that you would endorse that wouldn't you?  THUNE: Well it acts -- I mean I think again they act as a filter and they create a bubble for users.  And they use algorithms to -- for users to see what they think those users want to see. And this is a big problem. I mean I think you have got... CAVUTO: Yes.  THUNE: You have got now three companies essentially editing everything and limiting what the American people have access to in terms of users on these platforms.  So they have got to be accountable and... CAVUTO: Would you break them up? Senator would you break them up?  Some of your Democratic colleagues for very different reasons say they have gotten too big for their britches and we should break them up. Do you support that?  THUNE: There is -- there is a good argument to be made that these have -- they exercise monopolistic power in the market.  And I think that's an issue probably more for the Judiciary Committee than for the Commerce Committee. But we certainly want to look at the question of Section 230 and how that's being applied and whether or not these big platforms are acting as they say as neutral platforms or have they in fact become publishers?  Are they now stepping on the content and deciding what is and what isn't seen by the American people? And if they're preventing it from being distributed via Twitter that too is -- that's a way that's an action that filters the content the American people see.  And if we're going to have an open market we have got to have an open market. If we're not we need to figure out what the parameters ought to be. And I think this whole issue of content moderation is something that the American people need to have looked at by their elected leaders by policy-makers in Washington.  And so I'm glad we're having a hearing. I hope we get some answers and I hope we get some movement on reform.  CAVUTO: Very quickly. We have about 30 seconds Senator. I'm sorry. THUNE: That's all right.  CAVUTO: But Mitch McConnell seems to put the kibosh on aggressive stimulus here.  The president wanted to go big go even bigger. Mitch McConnell is at the $500 billion mark. Are you that in other words nothing bigger will be entertained by the U.S. Senate?  THUNE: I think there's probably -- there -- we would have some votes for something that would be bigger than that.  But the bigger it gets the fewer Republican votes you're going to have. I can -- I have to count the votes. So I kind of know what that threshold is.  But it's as much as -- as much the policy as it is the number. I mean the number is important but the components the features of the bill are also important.  CAVUTO: All right.  THUNE: And I think the leader is pointing out that the Democrats are being intransigent in what they're asking for. CAVUTO: All right. All right we will see what happens. Senator Thune always good catching up with you. THUNE: Yes.  CAVUTO: John Thune on the message is clear at least from the United States Senate. They can cobble together anything they want in the House.  Right now it would be kind of dead on arrival in the Senate.  But this is Washington. Things change.  Here's ""The Five.""

311,Whitaker: Twitter Facebook 'showed the worst of their platforms'," Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck and Democratic challenger Isaac “Ike” McCorkle held their first and only congressional debate Friday night which ended with McCorkle shouting questions at Buck after the session was supposed to conclude. McCorkle's explosion started during Buck’s closing remarks in which he asked why McCorkle chose to hold a fundraising event with progressive activist Khristopher Jacks who was seen claiming in a Project Veritas video this week that if President Trump were to re-win the presidency a left-wing militant group should rise up. Fox News could not confirm the validity of the Project Veritas footage or reach Jacks for comment. “I hope you’ll give every penny back that you earned in that fundraiser with somebody of this mentality” Buck said to McCorkle. “This is absolutely disgraceful that the Democrat Party and a candidate running for office in the 4th Congressional District would do something like this.” But McCorkle who had already given his closing remarks shot back with questions of his own and disregarded the moderator’s call for the debate to end. “I can’t let you continue…because you’ve already had your closing remarks” the moderator told McCorkle. Buck advised his opponent to speak with the journalists present after the debate and he along with the moderator got up to leave the event as McCorkle continued to shout questions. “I would call on my opponent to denounce white supremacy in all its forms and fashions” McCorkle continued undeterred. BIDEN CAMPAIGN SAYS THEY ARE NOT AHEAD BY DOUBLE-DIGIT LEAD “I would like to ask my opponent why he wore a ‘Kill ‘Em All and Let God Sort ‘Em Out’ T-shirt the day after innocent Americans were gunned down on American streets” he added referring to a controversial shirt Buck wore during a political rally in August. ""I’d like to have the opportunity for you to answer those questions.” Neither Buck nor McCorkle could be immediately reached by Fox News for comment. Buck's campaign spokesman Joe Jackson said the debate had ended and McCorkle did not honor decorum. ""Ike McCrkle clearly broke the rules that both sides had agreed to"" Jackson said. ""His time was up and the debate was over."" Both candidates are running for the seat in the Fourth Congressional District the largest district in the state and a traditionally Republican area. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Buck has held the seat since 2015 and beat his previous Democratic opponent in 2018 by nearly 78500 votes. The last time Colorado’s Fourth District saw a Democratic Representative win election was in 2008.

312,Debate between Colorado congressmen Ken Buck Ike McCorkle ends as challenger shouts questions," This is a rush transcript from “The Story with Martha MacCallum "" October 15  2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good evening everybody I'm Martha MacCallum in New York and this is ""The Story."" Of an election that is now 19 days away. It is October in every way folks and both sides are slugging it out.The Former Vice President ahead and double digits in the polls meanwhile the president continues to draw crowds in battleground states and Republicans claim that they have added 140000 new voters to the rolls through a massive registration effort nationwide.And now after the president's brief battle with COVID-19 at the beginning of October and October surprise for the Biden Campaign reporting being done by ""The New York Post"" puts the spotlight once again on the Biden family finances.Purported emails and photos raise new questions about how the Biden's have made their money during a lifetime in politics. And why Hunter Biden would have actively sought business deals with countries with whom his father was negotiating foreign policy as vice president at the time.And those countries were not the U.K. France or Italy. They were billion-dollar arrangements reportedly with Russia Ukraine and China. We have known for some time that at least Hunter's Ukraine deals troubled the Obama Administration.Then in a whole another side and layer to this story you've got Twitter and Facebook blocking ""The New York Post"" stories they did actively again today and these are ongoing investigative pieces and you can't find them on Twitter or Facebook. So that's another element all of this.But first to break it all down here now is the person who was at the center of all of this the Former New York City Mayor and Attorney to the President Rudy Giuliani. Mayor Giuliani good to have you with us tonight and thanks for being here.RUDY GIULIANI PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY: Good to be with you Martha. How are you?MACCALLUM: I'm doing fine. Thank you.GIULIANI: Healthy?MACCALLUM: I'm healthy. I'm glad you are not coughing like last time and you had a negative so that's good news.GIULIANI: Oh that created a heck of a thing.MACCALLUM: Yes sure it did. All right so I want to get to the origins of all this in a moment but last time we talked about Ukraine.GIULIANI: Sure.MACCALLUM: We showed the Ukraine emails and tonight I want to ask you some questions about the China side of this story in particular.GIULIANI: Sure.MACCALLUM: And what the deal was as you understand it that Hunter Biden struck there that involved the State Bank of China run by the Communist government there and explain the players in this deal and we have a full screen here that shows one of the emails from James Gilliar so explain to people what you think was going on here.GIULIANI: We have two deals that I've analyzed in China and they are two very big ones. One was the investment in the Hunter Biden Chris Heinz and Bolger Private Equity Fund that was owned by the vice president's son the Secretary of State's stepson and the nephew believe it or not of Bolger and - is the name of it.And the Chinese government over a period of time through the Bank of China committed $1.5 billion and became a partner. So essentially while Joe Biden is vice president was negotiating with China and I might say getting his head kicked in contemporaries reports will tell you that even ""The New York Times"" he was losing on every point to China.His son the Secretary of State's stepson and the nephew to one of the biggest organized criminals in America got a $1.5 billion commitment to their totally useless private equity fund. At a time in which this - the emails and the pictures and that will demonstrate that Hunter Biden was seriously suffering from drug addiction.There's no doubt that China had all the pictures that I now have of him as a drug addict. He was continuously a drug addict from 2014 until as recently as 2020. He got kicked out - remember he got kicked out of the navy after only two months.His father pulled all kinds of strings to get him in at 40. You usually get in for some kind of specialty. They put him in public relations hardly a specialty. Within two months he couldn't stop taking crack cocaine. He failed and his rebound was his father getting him the deal with Nicole Zinoleesky who was one of the most crooked men in Ukraine. This China deal--MACCALLUM: OK. Go ahead.GIULIANI: This China deal happened when his father took him over on Air Force 2. His father was going to try to negotiate with China to get them out of the islands they were disputing with Japan. He failed to do that. In fact they expanded their military presence there. But Joe came back with nice good words about China. He's the one who said China is not a threat China is not a competitor.MACCALLUM: All right.GIULIANI: He's the only man in the world who would say that. Was that influenced by the fact that the son who is a serious drug addicts got $1.5 billion in commitments from China? That's an extraordinary amount of money--MACCALLUM: I want to put up a piece of email that you are talking about. And just show everybody this email that this one was part of ""The New York Post"" investigation that is all coming off of this laptop.And it says you know at the moment they have a provisional agreement that the equity will be distributed and it says 20 will go to H and it goes through different initials I suppose. There is one that says H I assume that you believe that means Hunter. At the bottom it says 10 will be held by H for the big guy. Tell me what this means?GIULIANI: You've got to guess who the big guy is? If you need any guessing about who the big guy is all you have to do is take a look at the arrangement made for the office of this business where the Chinese Communist government was up partner.When the offices opened Hunter Biden sends a memo in the first two people he puts down to have keys to the office are Joe Biden and Jill Biden. So Joe Biden and James Biden were all going to have offices with the government of China essentially. This business we're talking about now is a different one.MACCALLUM: Yes. Do you have evidence that this guy means Joe Biden? You know just to lay it out quite clearly do you evidence that that is--GIULIANI: The only evidence - the only evidence I have right now is here it says big guy and here it says that he's the first person to get a key in the office that this business is going to occupy. We've got to put those two things together. But I haven't finished yet with the hard drive. There are some extraordinary things on it and I don't know.MACCALLUM: Let me ask you this--GIULIANI: If I was in court I would put these two things together. There's a certain amount of unbelievable unbelievable expansion of reality that's given to Biden. I mean who would up about the big"" be?MACCALLUM: All right. Let me ask you one more thing because I thought this is very interesting. I understand the point that you're trying to make. This is a text message that I saw you talk about this morning that you say is from Hunter Biden to his daughter Naomi.And on this text message it says I love all of you but I don't receive any respect and that's fine I guess works for you apparently. I hope you all can do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family for 30 years. It's really hard. But don't worries unlike pop I won't make you give me half your salary.Now this obviously - I just want to point out that your main argument here appears to be not that there was a quid pro quo that there was policy impact from what he is doing but that he was the moneymaker for the Biden family and that is at the very least unethical in terms of the way the money was being made attaching himself to the his father the vice president in order to get these deals and you're argument is that that's the only way--GIULIANI: No not quite correct Martha.MACCALLUM: In what way?GIULIANI: No it isn't. My argument as this is a racketeering case that went on for 30 years. I mentioned 30 years a year ago probably on your show. I said for 30 years the Biden family has been selling Joe's office to the highest bidder.MACCALLUM: So let me ask you this where did this text message come from? This text message is not used in ""The New York Post"" investigation which is based on the hard drive that you gave them.Also people who claim that have concerns about the origin of this hard drive and whether or not it's some form of Russian disinformation which I want you to reply to claim that there is no metadata attached to it? There's no address on this text message so prove to everybody right now that this text message is legit. Can you?GIULIANI: Yes I can. I mean I can't right now I don't have the hard drive with me but it comes right off the hard drive. ""The New York Post"" has possession of it; they just elected not to publish it. Its right in the hard drives those two messages. I don't know if you had the two messages above it.MACCALLUM: We do we have it on the screen right now.GIULIANI: His daughter's name. I mean look the hard drive will eventually be out if it's not put me in jail. I'm telling you it's on the hard drive. That's where I took it from.MACCALLUM: How do you know the hard drive definitely belongs --? GIULIANI: You think a Russians gave it to me?MACCALLUM: I am asking because there are all these questions that I know you are aware of so I'm giving you a chance to--GIULIANI: --Martha they have been feeding us this garbage for years. This isn't from Russia! Look this is a deal every witness told me existed. Hunter just wrote it out for us. This is the deal that is outlined in the first chapter of the book ""Secret Empire."" This is the way that Chinese do corruption. They don't pay the principal. They paid the relatives so they don't have to file around him. This is what Chinese Bank paid a billion dollars in fines for.MACCALLUM: Look there is no doubt none of this looks good and none of this--GIULIANI: Of course it doesn't look good!MACCALLUM: --the way anybody should operate in relation to the Vice President of the United States and a family member who is making money off that position. I'm just merely asking to explain some of the origin so that you can put to rest some of these things that are out there that are trying to shoot down your evidence here.GIULIANI: Sure.MACCALLUM: And I was just asking if you can identify them and answer for that.GIULIANI: I can. The answer is it's on the hard drive. The hard drive will eventually be examined by anybody who wants to examine it. I wouldn't invite - you want to send somebody from Fox to my office? They can look at this. They can look at the hard drive. I will show it to them tomorrow.MACCALLUM: OK.GIULIANI: I actually have it memorized as to exactly where it is on the hard drive. I have to tell you I've only been able to go through a third of the hard drive. And my people have only been able to go through a third even I think ""The Post"" has probably only gone through 20 percent of it.It's huge. And the reason I hate bringing up the fact that he's a drug addict because I feel sorry for him as a drug addict. But there is something really important about that. The first thing is it's a national security risk. I mean do you remember how the Democrats were all worried that the Russians had all these bad tapes on Donald Trump?MACCALLUM: I sure do and you saw that all over Twitter. Nobody blocked any of that.GIULIANI: And the Chinese have those tapes on Hunter Biden and Joe Biden's family. MACCALLUM: All right.GIULIANI: And the tapes are horrendous.MACCALLUM: We want to continue to being into this - go ahead.GIULIANI: They could squeeze Joe at anytime they want. They could squeeze Joe with this anytime they want. The second transaction we are talking about was actually in my view set up for the purpose of squeezing Joe Biden because--MACCALLUM: All right let me as you one last question from those who are challenging this and that's on Andre--GIULIANI: Sure please.MACCALLUM: He has now been determined by investigation of the U.S. Treasury Department to be a Russian agent who is waging a covert influence campaign to affect the U.S. election by releasing information about purported Biden wrongdoing. He someone that you spent several months with he's a former member of the Ukraine parliament. What do you say to that?GIULIANI: Well first of all I didn't spend several months. I met with him three times over three to four months. Second he gave me no relevant information about Joe Biden. His information relates to $5.3 billion in foreign aid that's missing in Ukraine $3 billion of which is American which he alleges the Obama Administration covered up.It's already led to the prosecution of two people for embezzling about $140 million who were closely associated - he actually worked for George Soros. He gave me no information on Hunter Biden Joe Biden--MACCALLUM: So nothing connected to this at all?GIULIANI: He doesn't know about that case zero and zero.MACCALLUM: All right. Just wanted to ask you because that is some of the reporting that is out there in reaction to this. We always go overtime whenever we talk. I want you to come back so we can do this--GIULIANI: They are going to throw every piece of dirt they can Martha.MACCALLUM: Rudy Giuliani thank you very much.GIULIANI: Every piece of dirt they can but I can take it.MACCALLUM: Yes I know you can. Thank you very much good to have you here sir.GIULIANI: Sure.MACCALLUM: Good to see you. So with the hearings over now President Trump is confident today that his third Supreme Court pick will be confirmed and Senate Judiciary Committee Lindsey Graham when ""The Story"" continues.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: It's not the law of Amy; it's the law of the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: We have the votes; those are the words of the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as the hearing for the Supreme Court Nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett come to a conclusion. Today the Judiciary Committee heard from witnesses and then they set a date for their vote which is October 22nd 1 week from today. Democrats did continue to lambaste the process calling it a sham.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): Not only do you have your own precedent not only do you have the example of Abraham Lincoln but you have the fact that because of what this president has been saying it undermines this process undermines the court and that is why we should delay.SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Senator Klobuchar and Senator Harris before her both pointed out the fact that Abraham Lincoln did not make a nomination in those 27 days. What both of them omitted was that the Senate wasn't here. This was not the age of communing every weekend jumping on a united flight. ""The Washington Post"" conclusion was that Senator Harris' argument ""Wasn't exactly true.""(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Joining me now is Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham. Chairman Graham good to have you with us today. I'm sure it's been a long week for you.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you.MACCALLUM: So thanks for joining us tonight. We appreciate it. I just want to put up a moment between you and Senator Feinstein this morning hugging it out on the way out the door as we take a look at that. Overall she commanded you on your handling of this across the board. How do you think it went?GRAHAM: I think it went very well. Judge Barrett proved to the country any fair-minded person she is qualified to be on the court. As to Senator Feinstein she is going to vote against the nominee. She has opposed the process at every turn.I respect her she respects me. And the people criticizing her they are in charge of the Democratic Party. In their world you can't even have mutual respect so it's mutual destruction. So I hope people understand that the folks pushing the Democratic Party object to Senator Feinstein saying something nice about me. God help us all if they get in control of the government.MACCALLUM: You know there is occasionally a yearning for the cordiality that used to exist in these forums and I think we saw a little bit of that bubble up from Feinstein. But then there is a whole another side that seems to want to dig in their heels and not go back there. I thought you said something interesting you said the qualification test to me seems to be dead and buried with everybody but me. What did you mean by that?GARHAM: Well I voted for Stoudemire (ph) and Kagan understanding they had a different judicial philosophy. Justice Scalia got 97 votes I think. Justice Ginsburg got like 96. They are polar opposites in terms of judicial philosophy. It used to be in the Senate that you looked at qualifications understanding elections matter but why is it always conservative's elite Thomas Kavanaugh.So what I would say to my Democratic colleagues I respect you I want to work with you but you try to destroy Judge Kavanaugh's life. I don't need any lectures from Democrats on this Committee about fair.So I would love to do it differently. When it was my turn to be where you are at I voted for Stoudemire and Kagan and how do we get repaid? You tried to destroy Judge Kavanaugh. Here is the good news there was no Kavanaugh-like attacks on Judge Barrett. I think they've learned their lesson and I hope this sets the tone for the future time will tell.MACCALLUM: That's what I was going to ask you because you know if - as we all remember we were at this stage when the Kavanaugh allegations began.GRAHAM: Yes.MACCALLUM: Now you talk about October 22nd that 7 long days when everyone looks at this process and says it was handled well. Do you sense that there is anything in the works to try to gum up this vote?GRAHAM: I don't know but after the Kavanaugh experience I don't sleep well at night. I sleep with one eye open. There are groups out there who are attacking Senator Feinstein for just showing common courtesy to me. Only God knows what they would do?I can tell you this when it comes to this election cycle Democrats have raised about $400 million since the passing of Justice Ginsburg to destroy people like me. My opponent raise $57 million because I dare stood up for Kavanaugh and I'm trying to help Trump.I've got Amy's back and she needs to have my back that there is a lot at stake here. So they are trying to gin up Democrats to destroy this fine nominee in Judge Barrett. They do so at their own peril. If Senator Schumer and this crowd do this again I think it will blow up in their face even worse than Kavanaugh.MACCALLUM: Yep. You know that's what I wonder. I mean there's definitely a political assessment to be made whether or not it's worth it?GRAHAM: yes.MACCALLUM: And there were indications that it was politically a mistake. When you look at the polls in South Carolina and you just mentioned you were in a tight race. I think your opponent has raised $20 million more than the highest racing Senate candidate which was Beto O'Rourke before that.So there's a ton of money going into this race to end your time in Washington but look at this in South Carolina 52 percent support Amy Coney Barrett 30 percent oppose and 17 percent apparently I don't know doesn't know or hasn't decided after the course of this week. Do you think this has a positive impact on your campaign overall? The latest numbers I saw for you are up a 6.GRAHAM: Oh my God does this have a positive impact for me yes absolutely. Thank you President Trump for nominating a qualified conservative pro-life unashamedly religious woman who has the qualifications and the disposition for the court to all the young women of the world wondering is it OK to be pro-life? If it is OK to embrace your faith the answer is yes.This is a historic moment for the country to have somebody like Justice Barrett to go on the court but when it comes to South Carolina we want conservative judges we don't want liberal judges. Judge Barrett will play very well in South Carolina and I think she's playing very well throughout the country. She is unashamedly religious but she will not impose your religion on you or me.She is going to view the law through the lens of an originalist which should be comforting to everybody. She will not be a legislator in a robe. She will apply the lot of the facts and we should all be pleased. But finally to all the young women there's a place at the table for you. MACCALLUM: I heard you say that a couple times through the course of these proceedings and I think that it was heard across the country by a lot of young women who may be sometimes feel like they are shut out of the conversation and it's not OK to feel the way that they feel.And of course everyone should have the freedom to say and think what they feel and be able to have friendships on both sides of that equation. So let's play this just a quick moment from you today and I want to get your thoughts on it before we say goodbye.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAHAM: You all have a good chance of winning the White House. I don't know where the polls are going to be?SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): Thank you for acknowledging that.GRAHAM: Yes I think it's true.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So what you think of this race? 19 days to go it sounds like you like it could - you sound like it could go Biden's direction.GRAHAM: Well here is what I think. I think President Trump is going to win because the people who are trying to destroy Dianne Feinstein's well lived life because she gave me a hug are driving the Democratic Party to pat court add more justices beyond nine to make it liberal to change the rules of the Senate to do away with Electoral College.The most radical agenda in modern political history is being pushed. I think that's why think President Trump is going to win. I know that's why he's going to win in South Carolina. I know that's why I'm going to win. So yes is it close? Close but I like the way this race is trending. President Trump is coming on at a time that matters. And President Trump you got to hell of a first term and talk more about it.MACCALLUM: Senator Lindsey Graham thank you very much sir. Good to see you tonight.GRAHAM: Thank you.MACCALLUM: 19 more days that is how long undecided voters have to make their choice for president. We are going to talk to three of them from three battleground states after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Two of the big stories dominating the campaign trail this week Hunter Biden's e-mail revelations purported e-mail revelations that we were just talking to the former mayor of New York about and also the big hearings that dominated this week for Judge Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court. Both of them unfolding just two weeks since the president confirmed his COVID diagnosis which surprised a lot of people and made a lot of news. Here now on how all of this can play out over the next 19 days. Three undecided voters from crucial battleground states. We have Christopher Formoso of Florida a financial analyst -- analysis manager who voted for Gary Johnson back in 2016. He is a registered Republican. Caitlin Singleton Democrat from Wisconsin is a rental housing site manager mom of three she voted for Hillary Clinton last time around. And Andrew Rodney of Michigan COO of a plastic manufacturing company. He voted for Gary Johnson in 2016. And he is an independent. Thank you so much for all of you for being here tonight. Caitlin you spoke with us several weeks back and so since the last time we spoke a lot of things have happened and one of the biggest stories as I said this week has been hearings for Amy Coney Barrett. Did you watch them and did they have any influence on how you are thinking now? CAITLIN SINGLETON UNDECIDED WISCONSIN VOTER: Yes so I did watch them. I taped them and watch them when my kids went to bed all of the hearings. I don't think they necessarily had an impact on how I will be voting. I'm still undecided at this point. You know I was hoping the debate would clear that up for me. They did not. I'm crossing my fingers that the next debate coming up will clear it up for me as time is definitely taking now. I have mixed feelings about the hearing. I support the appointee I think she's incredibly skilled I think that was very evident in the hearing I am also a Catholic and pro-life so I do -- those personal aspects resonate with me. I have mixed feelings about the process though and the double standards that I've kind of seen from what happened the last time around with the -- with Garland. So I have mixed feelings about it. I do support the appointee the SCOTUS appointee though and it does not have any impact on my voting. Yes.MACCALLUM: OK. Christopher what is playing large in your mind as you look at some of these big stories lately? CHRISTOPHER FORMOSO UNDECIDED FLORIDA VOTER: Well with ACB I think she's a fantastic woman she has more character than anyone probably in this country. She adopted two kids from a third world country gave them a great life here in Haiti. My wife used to serve in Haiti and I've heard stories of how rough it is there.And the fact that she's -- just treated kind of ported back is expected. But the packing of the court that is absurd. One of the three major powers of this country and what's going to happen when a presidential -- a Republican becomes president down the road? They are going to repack it? They are going to have like 100 judges at one point to keep getting power it's ridiculous. MACCALLUM: It's a good point. Andrew what about you with the news that you are hearing and the things that are the input for your decision? How is that all playing out right now? ANDREW RODNEY UNDECIDED MICHIGAN VOTER: It's a lot of noise. You know it's just that they are just shoving everything at you now and attacking everybody. But Amy Coney Barrett I again high character. She doesn't have a lot of legal experience but she's going to get appointed so move on. It would be great if the Senate could do you know more effective business than just have this political theater. So and that's how a lot of this feels. The debates were certainly disappointing. Trump just embarrassed himself and Biden didn't really bring anything new. So I think and the Hunter Biden revelation is you know is nothing new. This is the way it's been influence peddling. But so no real change in my perspective except probably more disenchanted with Trump. But Biden has done nothing at all except make himself look -- you know make Trump look worse. That's about it. So it's a disappointing election. We need to fix the political system that's causing this cancer to our country. MACCALLUM: So how do you think you'll vote if you had to vote today Andrew work what would you do? RODENY: I'm probably leaning to vote for a third-party candidate for the libertarian party or writing somebody and actually and then I worry about Democrats taking full control of the entire government. So I might vote for a Republican Senate campaign -- candidate for the sake of avoiding that. And our House candidates. I'm uncertain. You know to be honest and a lot of elections I don't vote. If I don't know somebody I don't know their background or anything I don't vote.MACCALLUM: Yes.RODNEY: And I wish that more people who didn't really understand the details wouldn't vote. It's like Amy Coney Barrett. You know if you are not a legal expert you don't know the background of those things to sit there and express your opinion it's good for people to know but let the more important people in the position. So. MACCALLUM: I thought it was a good education and a lot of that just listening to it over the course of this week. And she's a you know a circuit court judge for three years so she does have quite a bit of experience and also as a legal professor. Caitlin tell me about Wisconsin right now. How do you think what's your feel for which way Wisconsin might be leaning? SINGLETON: You know it's hard to tell. Where I'm at in Middleton there are -- I don't see a single Trump sign. Maybe one or two. Everything is Biden. One thing I'm noticing that's very different from the last year or the last election I should say in 2016 is when I go through rural Wisconsin I'm seeing a lot of Biden signs on farms and in 2016 that was all Trump. MACCALLUM: That's right.SINGLETON: So that is definitely a change although you go to different counties and it's all Trump. So it's really hard to tell. It's hard to tell. MACCALLUM: Before just real quickly Christopher just about 20 seconds what's your feel for Florida? FORMOSO: I think Trump is going to win it. We're -- I think Cuban American population I'm a first-generation Cuban-American. We feel proud of this country. The Democrats seem to hate this country. I think it's an impressive country for us. We are all minorities and we made it to this country so I think it's going to be Trump in Florida. MACCALLUM: Great to have all of you with us. Thank you for sharing your viewpoints this evening and for being here. Thank you all. RODNEY: Thank you for having us.SINGLETON: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Twenty days to go. All right. So chairman Ron Johnson of the committee now investigating these alleged Biden e-mails. He is coming up. His committee also looked into this so we'll see what he thinks now.And next Dr. Shelby Steele as cancel culture strikes his new documentary exploring race relations in America. Glad to have him back on the show. He is next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHELBY STEELE FILMMAKER: Absolutely race played a significant part of the reaction. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What happened in Ferguson was more about America the very same America that would explode in 2020. (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Writer and filmmaker Shelby Steele is focused on race in America for decades. He has a bold voice that is not always welcome in the current BLM dominant look at the root causes of the conditions of black lives in our country today so the subject of the new film is an event that sparked enormous controversy over what happened and what did not happened in the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. As you look at this trailer keep in mind that Amazon which is owned by Jeff Bezos which also owns the Washington Post has declined to stream this movie on their platforms a move that the Wall Street Journal editorial board is now decrying. Writing quote ""by canceling important dissenting voices like Steeles on such a vital subject Amazon is inviting a political backlash."" Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What happened in Ferguson was more about America the very same America that would explode in 2020. Where every black was George Floyd and every cop was Derek Chauvin. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can do better next time by doing the right thing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Since the '60s whites have lived under the accusation that they are racist. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Ferguson really became a destination for successful African Americans.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We were not part of white flight. No.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some people want to be angry at someone. Michael Brown had tried to buy cigarillos the night before with pot. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He put his hands on the earth but the officer still approached with his weapons drawn and he fired seven more shots. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS CHIEF ANCHOR ABC NEWS: Some witnesses have also said that they actually saw you stand over him. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not being correct.STEPHANOPOULOS: What did you see in that face? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Aggression there was nothing. It was like hollow just looking through me. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What demons might have been at work within him and to make the final fateful charge against Officer Wilson.(END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Joining me now the film's writer and narrator Dr. Shelby Steele a senior Hoover fellow on race relations. Good to have you with us as always Shelby. Thank you very much for coming back. You received an e-mail --STEELE: Thanks for having me.MACCALLUM: -- that said that your title doesn't meet prime videos content quality expectations not eligible for publishing on the service and we won't be accepting a resubmission of this title so don't try to come back around again. What do you think about all this sir? STEELE: I think what they are saying really when it's all over with is they are saying dare to look at blacks in America as something as human beings rather than as victims. And we are invested as this huge massive corporation in the political correctness of seeing blacks as victims. You see them as more complex than that and that's intolerable. We are going to no matter what you do we're going to insist that they remain in the American sort of cultural world. We are going to make sure that they continue to be seen as victims who are old things. I like to say Amazon this is one of a classic example of white guilt coming out and I now can claim to be a victim of white guilt. MACCALLUM: I want to play another piece -- (CROSSTALK)STEELE: So I can waive -- I can waive my flag and ask for redress too. MACCALLUM: I want to play another piece of this that may have also you know provoked to this action. Listen to this part of the documentary.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEELE: Perhaps the most insidious feature of liberalism after the 1960s is that it dismisses individual responsibility as an agent of black uplift. Problems are always the fault of a systemic enemy like racism. Let's ask a daring question. One that a group like Black Lives Matter would forbid. Is Michael Brown in any way responsible for his own death? Liberalism invisibilizes (ph) all of black America. It leaps over our actual problems to highlight racism as the source of all our ills. (END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: I mean in 2020 those are very strong words. And in many corners they don't go down well. Kamala Harris had tweeted about the murder of Michael Brown at one point and the Washington Post gave that four Pinocchio's. You know you had school children across America doing hands up don't shoot exercises and you are undercutting and shedding light on that in a different way sir. STEELE: All of these incidents Freddie Gray Trayvon Martin Michael Brown the fascination with them again is that -- here's the idea of blacks being victimized by whites. That is an -- that is our avenues as a minority. That's our avenue to entitlement to power. Our power in American life as blacks is in our victimization. We haven't invented the computer we didn't do a number of other things we are though victims of American evil. And that gives us a moral authority that constitutes raw power. And we'll do anything to protect it and we then use that power to shakedown institutions like Amazon who need are in premature in order for their brand to seem to be innocent of racism so it's a symbiotic sort of problem that we -- that then all of America has to deal with. MACCALLUM: Well I think you know people should know that Reverend Al Sharpton is in this documentary the NAACP. There's a lot of different viewpoints presented here and --STEELE: Yes.MACCALLUM: -- it is called what killed Michael Brown. Dr. Shelby Steele thank you very much for bringing it to us and we look forward to talking to you again soon. Thank you sir. STEELE: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Chairman Ron Johnson on the plan to investigate a brand-new trove of alleged Hunter Biden documents and a new Washington Post story about this just coming out tonight after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Minutes after our interview with President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani about his involvement in these Hunter Biden e-mails the Washington Post has now reported tonight that the White House was warned last year that Giuliani quote ""was being used to feed Russian misinformation to the president."" Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson has been very deeply involved in this whole issue as well and he joins me now. Senator thank you very much for being here tonight. Are you aware of those reports? The report is that Robert O'Brien the national security adviser went to the president and said that he had information from our intelligence services that Rudy Giuliani was possibly the target of being fed some of this Russian information? Are you aware of those? SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): I'm aware that Russia continues to try to influence and interfere in our election there's no doubt about that. I'm also aware that Democrats created a false intelligence product falsely accusing Chuck Grassley and I of accepting Russian disinformation which we did not do from that same individual Andrii Derkach. We didn't know who the guy was had not accepted any information. So I also know there's a fair amount of falsely allegations being thrown around this issue as well. MACCALLUM: So you know this whole story and we didn't even get into this part of it with Rudy Giuliani but this guy who owns a computer store who claims that Hunter Biden dropped off his laptop there and he was concerned about it it was left there indefinitely so he then basically owned the laptop under an agreement. And that laptop information was also sent to your office why didn't you bring this story out? Did you have concerns about the nature of this information? JOHNSON: Well we were contacted by the whistleblower normally I wouldn't even be talking about this because we maintain the anonymity of whistleblowers but the day after we issued our reports we were contacted by the whistleblower. We talked to the individual and you know we started our due diligence process of validating and verifying the information he provided to us. One of the steps we took is we reached out to the FBI and it took them over a week to get back to us and basically give us no response. Now in public reporting we know the FBI apparently obtained this computer through a warrant or through a subpoena in December of 2019 and I think the FBI has to come clean in terms of did they receive this have they done forensics on this computer what did they know about it?Have they tracked this town? Have they investigated this? Have they gone and tried to verify some of these e-mails? In other words were the recipients or the senders -- or the senders have they verified that these are true e-mails are these true photos true videos? The FBI had this in December of 2019 right in the midst of the whole impeachment process there might be information relevant to our investigation there might have been information relevant to the impeachment. If the FBI just sat on this computer and did nothing with it they need to explain to us why but they also need to explain to us what they did with it. This is important information for the American public to sift and sort through. MACCALLUM: Yes absolutely. I mean absolutely it is. And I think people need to know whether or not this is a you know whether they verified did the FBI verified whether or not this laptop ever actually belongs to Hunter Biden. I mean that's a very basic thing that I would imagine they would be able to figure out so we need to go through this every step of the way and determine whether or not this information is verifiable. Very quick thought I got to go in about 20 seconds Senator.JOHNSON No they do. And this isn't a normal criminal investigation where if they investigate somebody and they find nothing they completely -- they completely keep that confidential. This is wrongdoing in the political realm and the American public really deserve to know the truth. (CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: We need to know one way or the other. Absolutely. Senator thank you very much sir you're so great tonight. Senator Ron Johnson.JOHNSON: Have a good night.MACCALLUM: More of The Story right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: That is The Story of this Thursday night October 15th 2020. But as always The Story continues so we will be back here with you tomorrow at seven o'clock.

313,Graham: Barrett proved her qualifications to sit on Supreme Court," Oct. 15 2020 – This is a rush transcript from “Tucker Carlson Tonight” October 15 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.  There's an awful lot of noise in the news right now as you would expect.  There's an election coming three weeks away. Everyone wants to get a blow in before it's too late. But not everything you hear is untrue and not every story is complex.  At the heart of the growing Biden-Ukraine scandal for example is a very straightforward question: did Joe Biden subvert American foreign policy in order to enrich his own family?  In 2015 Joe Biden was the sitting Vice President of the United States.  Included in his portfolio were U.S. relations with the nation of Ukraine.  So at that moment Vice President Joe Biden had more influence over the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian economy than any other person on the globe outside of Eastern Europe.  Biden's younger son Hunter knew that. He hoped to get rich from his father's influence.  E-mails published yesterday by ""The New York Post"" documents apparently taken directly from Hunter Biden's own laptop tell some of that story.  Tonight we'd like to bring you some more detail.  We have another batch of e-mails some exclusive to the show. We believe they also came from Hunter Biden's laptop. We can't prove that they did. We haven't examined that computer.  But every detail that we could check including Hunter Biden's personal e- mail address at the time suggests they are authentic.  As we told you last night if these e-mails are fake this is the most complex and sophisticated hoax in history. It almost seems beyond human capacity.  The Biden campaign clearly believes these e-mails are real they have not said otherwise. We sent the body of them to Hunter Biden's attorney and never heard back. So with that in mind here's what we have learned.  On November 2 2015 at 4:30 in the afternoon a Burisma executive called Vadym Pozharskyi e-mailed Hunter Biden and his business partner Devon Archer. The purpose of the e-mail Pozharskyi explains is to quote ""be on the same page about our final goals including but not limited to a concrete course of action.""  So what did Burisma want exactly? Well good PR for starters. The executive wanted quote ""high ranking U.S. officials"" to express their quote ""positive opinion of Burisma."" And then he wanted the administration to act on Burisma's behalf. Quote ""The scope of work should also include organization of a visit of a number of widely recognized and influential current and/or former U.S. policymakers to Ukraine in November aiming to conduct meetings with and bring positive signals and message of support to Burisma.""  The goal the executive explained was to quote ""close down any cases/pursuits against the head of Burisma in Ukraine."" So that couldn't be clearer what they wanted. Burisma wanted Hunter Biden's father to get their company out of legal trouble with the Ukrainian government. And that's exactly what happened.  One month later to the day on December 2nd 2015 Hunter Biden received a notice from a Washington PR firm called Blue Star Strategies. Blue Star Strategies apparently have been hired to lobby the administration on Ukraine.  This show has exclusively obtained that e-mail. ""Hello all"" it began.  ""This morning the White House hosted a conference call regarding the Vice President's upcoming trip to Ukraine. Attached is a memo from the Blue Star Strategies team with the minutes of the call which outline the trip's agenda and addressed several questions regarding U.S. policy toward Ukraine."" End quote.  So here you have a PR firm involved in an official White House Foreign Policy call. How could that happen? Good question. But it worked.  Days later Joe Biden flew to Ukraine and did exactly what his son wanted.  The Vice President gave his speech slamming the very Ukrainian law enforcement official who was tormenting Burisma the exact guy.  If Ukrainian government doesn't fire its top prosecutor a man called Viktor Shokin Biden explained the administration withhold a billion dollars in American aid. And Ukraine is a poor country so they had no choice but to obey.  Biden's bullying worked. He bragged about it later.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor and they didn't.  So they said they had -- they were walking out the press conference and I said I'm not going to -- we're not going to give you the billion dollars.  They said you have no authority. You're not the President. The President said. I said call him.  I said I'm telling you're not getting the billion dollars. I said you're not getting the billion and I'm going to be leaving here. I think it was what -- six hours? Look I said I'm leaving in six hours if the prosecutor is not fired you're not getting the money.  Well son of a bitch he got fired.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON: Now Joe Biden gave that speech before the Council on Foreign Relations. So we pretend as if what he said was normal and officially authorized. This is how things are done.  That's not true at all. This is bizarre.  And the amazing thing about the video you just saw is that no one in that audience of Harvard graduates and other assorted smart people asked the glaringly obvious question: why was the Vice President of the United States threatening a tiny country like Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor? That doesn't seem like the Vice President's role?  Well now we know why. Viktor Shokin has signed an affidavit affirming that he was in fact investigating Burisma at the moment Joe Biden had him removed. Shokin said that before he was fired administration officials pressured him into dropping the case against Burisma. He would not do that so Joe Biden canned him.  That's how things really work in Washington. Your son has got a lucrative consulting deal with a Ukrainian energy company. You tailor American foreign policy to help make him rich. Our foreign policy.  Even at the State Department possibly the most cynical agency in government this seemed shockingly brazen.  During the impeachment proceedings last fall a State Department official called George Kent said it was widely known in Washington that the Bidens were up to something sleazy in Ukraine quote ""I was on a call with somebody on the Vice President's staff and I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma."" This George Kent noted could create a perception of a conflict of interest.  So how did the Vice President's office respond to this concern? Well according to George Kent quote ""The message that I recall hearing back was that the Vice President's son Beau was dying of cancer and there was no further bandwidth to deal with family related issues at the time.""  Family related issues. This was America's foreign policy being tailored to Joe Biden's son.  Five years later Joe Biden still has not been forced to explain why he fired Ukraine's top prosecutor at precisely the moment his son was being paid to get him to fire Ukraine's top prosecutor nor has Joe Biden addressed whether or not he personally benefited from the Burisma contract.  But there are tantalizing hints. Last night former Mayor Rudy Giuliani published what he said was yet another e-mail from Hunter Biden's laptop.  It's a note to one of his children. It's sad and it's fraught and it's personal and we're not going to quote it at length.  But at the end there's this quote ""Don't worry unlike your grandfather I won't make you give me half your salary."" What does that mean exactly?  Well we don't know.  There may be more detail on the laptop but unfortunately we don't have access to that. But the question remains: how has Joe Biden lived in extravagance all of these years on a government salary? No one has ever answered that question and the tech monopolies are working hard to make certain no one ever does.  This morning ""The New York Post"" published another story based on the e- mails. This one describes a business venture Hunter Biden was working on in China. The e-mail reads this way quote ""At the moment there's a provisional agreement that the equity will be distributed as follows 10 held by Hunter for the big guy."" The big guy. Is the big guy Joe Biden? If so how much did Joe Biden get? And how much of that came from the Communist Chinese government? Those are real questions.  This man could be elected President in three weeks but Twitter doesn't want you to wonder it won't allow you to ask those questions. Twitter restricted ""The New York Post"" story as quote ""unsafe"" like it was a lawn dart or a defective circular saw.  And that was enough for the Biden campaign. It was enormously useful. All day today they deflected questions about Joe Biden's subversion of our country's foreign policy by invoking Twitter's ban on ""The New York Post""  story.  So the tech monopolies censor information to help their candidate that candidate uses that censorship to dismiss the story. One hand washes the other. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JAMAL BROWN NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT: Well look I think Twitter's response to the actual article itself makes clear that these you know purported allegations are false and they're not true. And glad to hear you know to see you know social media companies like Twitter taking responsibility to limit misinformation.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON: You want to know what corruption looks like that's a term that we throw around a lot. You just saw what corruption looks like.  My campaign donors control the media. They're shutting down the public's access to the information that criticizes me. The fact they're doing that gives me justification not to address your question about that information.  That's what corruption looks like.  When billionaires shut down legitimate questions about a candidate three weeks before Election Day. That's corruption.  It's also almost perfectly circular reasoning and to illustrate that Twitter and Facebook censored ""The New York Post"" story before they had any reason whatsoever to suspect it was wasn't true. Even now they're not really claiming it's a hoax because it's not a hoax.  In minutes they simply shut down this country centuries' long tradition of a free press and they did it for purely partisan reasons. They didn't pretend otherwise.  Now it doesn't matter who you plan to vote for the first Tuesday in November you should be terrified.  Democracies cannot exist and never will be able to exist without the free flow of information. That is a prerequisite. And without it we're done.  But companies like Facebook and Google and Twitter do not care because they don't believe in democracy. They worship power. And they don't need to be consistent.  Melania Trump's private phone conversations the President's stolen tax returns. They were happy to publish all of that. They didn't have a problem with hacking.  But if you criticize the Democratic candidate their candidate you are banned. That's the standard they have set. How do we come back from this?  Today you had elected Democrats members of a party that in just the recent past claimed to revere free speech cheering on censorship. Here's the supposedly moderate Senator Chris Coons of Delaware doing just that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Facebook and Twitter have policies to not spread things that are utterly unreliable that have been debunked and where their origin is untrustworthy.  They are practicing their own internal controls as I wish they had over the past four years. If they had been more selective about what they posted in 2016 don't take my word for it listen to the head of the F.B.I. an active Russian disinformation campaign in 2016 had an influence on that election. They are trying even harder in this election.  I'm glad that they are managing the content on their own websites.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON: That man is a liar. Not one word of this story has been debunked.  Not one word in those e-mails has been quote ""debunked."" And if it is debunked we'll be the first to report it because we're not liars.  But did you catch the phrase he wanted you to hear? Russian disinformation.  That's what they are claiming these e-mails are and it's all over the internet. In fact free conspiracy laden conjecture crazier than anything the Q people ever thought of. But none of their garbage their lunatic lies about Russia is ever censored by the tech monopolies. It's not unsafe because it helps Joe Biden therefore you can read it.  Where are the real journalists now? We need them more than ever. They're gone. They're cowering. They're afraid. They don't want to upset power.  Jake Sherman of POLITICO who claims to be a news reporter actually apologized on Twitter for asking the Biden campaign about Hunter Biden's e- mails.  These people are craven. They have no standards. They have no self-respect.  Like their masters in Silicon Valley they worship power alone. Adam Schiff of California knows that feeling well. When he sees censorship it excites him. And he calls for more.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): The online ecosystem and unwitting audiences that the Kremlin so ably exploited remain vulnerable to unscrupulous homegrown actors who seed and spread falsehoods of their own.  If left unchecked there could be reversible damage not only to our nation's discourse but to how we as a society discern fact from fiction.  The leading social media platforms have all made significant changes in their policies and capabilities since 2016 but they have not changed the foundational features of their platforms that expose users and even recommend to them often extreme sensational or emotionally charged content.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON: That guy is the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and there he is affirming the censorship of his own campaign donors in Silicon Valley the most powerful people in the world. If this doesn't rattle your cage then nothing will.  Ten years ago no Member of Congress would have said what Adam Schiff just said in public. Never. It would be considered an obvious threat to our Constitution to the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights. The ACLU would have screamed. Professional journalists associations would have joined them.  But today they are all silent. Some are applauding and so it accelerates.  Watch this Member of Congress suggest that the government ought to decide what news organizations are allowed to publish just like they do in China.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do we need a new agency that essentially would be on behalf of the public making the rules subject to -- obviously with legislative authority as opposed to have that delegated to the tech giants?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON: Oh a new agency with legislative authority to decide what you're allowed to read. Sound familiar? We've even got a name for it actually ready to go. The Ministry of Truth and it's coming.  Miranda Devine writes for ""The New York Post."" She joins us again tonight and we are happy to have her.  Miranda thanks so much for coming back. Tell us since some of our viewers who have been relying on social media for their news may not know what ""The New York Post"" revealed today from this cache of e-mails.  MIRANDA DEVINE COLUMNIST ""THE NEW YORK POST"": Well this is day two of Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop and the e-mails and documents and photographs that are on it which all point to a cache for influence grift of the Biden family.  And today we published the China e-mails documents that showed tens of millions of dollars even hundreds of millions of dollars flowing to the Biden family from Chinese companies Chinese state-owned companies that are linked to the Chinese Communist Party.  For instance in one deal Hunter Biden is getting $10 million a year for quote ""introductions"" alone. This is from a Chinese energy company. In another case he is on a $1 million retainer for supposedly legal services.  In another case I think you mentioned there is a company a lucrative new Chinese company that split up six ways and allocated 20 percent here 10 percent there. Hunter Biden gets 20 percent but he also gets another 10 percent that he is holding for quote ""the big guy"" whoever that might be. You can use your imagination.  So what's significant about this is that these deals are happening after Joe Biden has stopped being Vice President. This is around 2017. But what is the Chinese Communist Party doing? What are they paying for exactly when they're giving tens hundreds of millions of dollars to the family of the former Vice President future presidential candidate who may be President of the United States as of November -- January?  So what exactly are they paying for? And you have to remember also that Joe Biden introduced his son Hunter in 2013 to the top officials of the Chinese Communist Party when he flew him there on Air Force Two for an eight-day visit in which Joe Biden met President Xi and failed miserably to do any of the things that he was sent there to do in America's national interest including stopping China from militarizing islands in the South China Sea.  So while America missed out Hunter Biden got a $1.5 billion deal with a subsidiary of a Chinese bank.  CARLSON: These are very serious charges and there are so many threads to what you said we can't possibly at this date know exactly where they all lead. But we do know that this is a story. This is news and it requires an explanation from the Joe Biden for President Campaign. Have you received one?  DEVINE: No you know yesterday Joe Biden called a lid went into hiding before 10:00 a.m. Today he has just done virtual fundraisers. He hasn't made himself available to journalists. He hasn't answered questions. He hasn't done press conferences.  The interesting thing is that his campaign is actually now hedging a bit.  Yesterday they said oh no you know we searched Joe Biden's official campaign calendar -- sorry official calendar from when he was Vice President and found no evidence of a meeting with the number three in the Ukrainian company Burisma that was paying his son so much money.  Yet today what they're saying is well look there might have been a meeting but it would have been informal on the sidelines very cursory. So hedging their bets.  That's a pretty bad sign. They have not pushed back and for all those Democrats and other apologists today who are saying that these are purported allegations that they've been debunked discredited et cetera.  None of that is true.  This is brand new evidence never been seen before. E-mails that point to a link between Joe Biden and his family's grift in these shady foreign countries these shady foreign companies and he hasn't answered it. Two days not an answer.  Maybe he will answer it tonight when he does a Town Hall. I doubt whether he will be asked any really tough questions though.  CARLSON: No. And some people aren't even aware of it because of the censorship and so we're proud to highlight ""The New York Post"" reporting on this show and to repeat that we will never submit -- period -- to censorship on this ever.  Miranda thanks so much for coming on. Appreciate it.  DEVINE: Thanks Tucker.  Well one editor at ""The New York Post"" said yesterday that a digital civil war is underway. Big Tech isn't even hiding its standards anymore. It is openly partisan openly repressive totalitarian in its instincts.  We'll talk to the editor who wrote that about where this is going because it is going somewhere. That's after the break.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  CARLSON: There have been hints for years now that the Big Tech companies -- Twitter Facebook Google -- had a sinister agenda a political agenda also a social agenda also an international agenda.  There have been hints of that for a long time for years and for years we've been telling you about it. But within 24 hours the last 24 hours they've bared their teeth simultaneously and made it obvious.  The Big Tech companies those monopolies shut down a legitimate news story in the middle of a presidential campaign and made it impossible for many Americans to read the facts about the news. That's never happened before in this country. It is a moment that historians will look back on as a turning point.  Sohrab Ahmari is the op-ed editor at ""The New York Post"" the newspaper that broke the story originally and he has a particularly insightful view of what this means and where it might be going. We wanted to talk to him about it tonight. Thanks so much for coming on.  So we're right in the middle of this but I think you agree that this is different from what's come before. We've never seen anything like this happen before in this country. What does it tell us? And what does it portend?  SOHRAB AHMARI OP-ED EDITOR ""THE NEW YORK POST"": Tucker I think it just should suggest a level of blatant-ness that we haven't seen before.  It began actually with Facebook we've talked a lot about Twitter. But it began with Facebook and specifically a Facebook communication staffer named Andy Stone saying that this story deserves to be fact checked and in the meanwhile Facebook is going to reduce its circulation online.  And what was fascinating disturbing and alarming about is that Andy Stone before he joined Facebook was a staffer for Senator Barbara Boxer Democrat of California and for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  And so the fact that they allowed him to go forward and say that we're reducing circulation on a story before there were any disputes about it and there are still as you showed earlier there isn't really any disputes about the underlying facts.  But he felt courageous enough or bold enough to just say as a former Democratic staffer who now has his hand over the levers of the internet essentially of where free speech lives or dies is on these platforms I'm going to reduce circulation in this story.  This is different than before and it's truly chilling and sinister.  CARLSON: Where are journalists in this? Where are the guardians of the First Amendment the people who make their living by the first point in the Bill of Rights the freedom of the press? They're not saying anything.  I mean just to be clear the Big Tech companies control the overwhelming majority of American media directly or indirectly and yet journalists are not speaking up against censorship. Why?  AHMARI: I mean I think there's this culture of groupthink where it really feels like all the elements of the establishment have lined up. You have Big Tech. You have Hollywood. You have media and they are all so bought into a kind of narrative where if a story is put forward including a story which you know you've seen some of the e-mails we've published the e-mails it's so much more solidly sourced than so many of the mountain of stories of anti-Trump stories that appeared in left of center media that were all based on hearsay.  You would think journalists would say let's dig into this. But immediately it becomes an effort to either shut it down or to attack the source and not to investigate the underlying fact of massive potential graft and corruption.  So the most chilling aspect we are seeing a journalist like Jake Sherman again you mentioned him earlier sort of you know he had won the victory over himself to quote George Orwell he posted this long apology for having posted our story and raised some questions about it.  That's the chilling effect in this it is that if you are going forward if you publish stories that go against the narrative you will have to kind of publicly confess and apologize. And you're talking about a story in the oldest continuously published newspaper in this country founded by Alexander Hamilton is not some shady website and you saw the story it was deeply reported. This is shameful in terms of my fellow reporters and editors.  CARLSON: It's one of the biggest circulation newspapers in this country.  It's not a small thing. How can someone like Jake Sherman apologizing for asking a question for forwarding a news story? How can someone like that continue to work in journalism? How can this go on?  AHMARI: Well I think look what we can do is continue to just present our reporting. We've been extremely transparent about our sourcing about the provenance from the beginning of the story much more so than say I don't know that story about suborning perjury.  The President suborning perjury that appeared in BuzzFeed. That was immediately debunked by the Mueller team itself and said that that's not true. Has that story been censored? Was it banned by Facebook? Was it reduced in circulation by Twitter?  No you can still post it and it was then so the hypocrisy is glaring. All we can do is continue to get the word out and hopefully more Americans can hear it.  CARLSON: Look I get that a lot of these people don't like Trump fine.  We've got an election three weeks but don't destroy our country. Don't destroy centuries' old traditions that underpin everything good that we have. And freedom of speech and of thought expression conscience. That's what we have. That's what makes this country different and better and they are wrecking it because they don't like Trump.  I can't even --  AHMARI: Yes I worry about the international ramifications. What if there is an election in say Spain or Poland where the Populist Party is unpopular with the establishment? How will our malign internet forces affect elections in democracies elsewhere in the developed world?  CARLSON: We're going to have to live with the consequences of this poison long after Trump is gone. It's very upsetting Sohrab Ahmari thank you so much. Great to see you.  AHMARI: Thanks for having me.  CARLSON: So a leading Democrat was caught on a hot mic today. It could happen to anyone but it always happens to most interesting people. It was during Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings. It told you a lot.  We'll show you the tape when we come back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  CARLSON: We are a people of faith Joe Biden and I Kamala Harris said the other night at the debate. That's not true. The Democratic Party is a secular party. I am not attacking them. It's just obvious.  A lot of Democrats are highly highly hostile to organized religion and a lot of them deeply resent Amy Coney Barrett for her orthodox Catholicism.  But they've decided not to say anything about it because it's an election year so they are trying to keep it under wraps. It's a political calculation obviously.  But what do they really think? Well privately Democrats are fixated on Amy Coney Barrett's religious beliefs. We know that in part because today Dianne Feinstein the senior senator from California didn't realize her mic was on and let the mask slip. Here she is.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA): She's been pro-life for a long time. So I suspect with her it is deeply personal and comes with her religion.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON: It's deeply personal and it comes with her religion like it's a disease. We shouldn't be surprised Dianne Feinstein said this. And by the way Catholicism is one of the few religions you're allowed to say this about.  In 2017 Feinstein told Amy Coney Barrett that her religious faith was quote ""a concern.""  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  FEINSTEIN: I think whatever a religion is it has its own dogma. The law is totally different. And I think in in your case Professor when we read your speeches the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you and that's of concern.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON: The dogma lives loudly within you not the dog the dogma lives loudly within you. In terms of sheer incoherence and stupidity it's almost like a Mazie Hirono impression. Honestly.  The big secret in Washington is that a lot of these people dripping with credentials like third world generals and their medals are actually not very bright.  So what does Amy Coney Barrett really like? Anne Falgoust has known for a long time. She has been close friends with Amy Coney Barrett since college and we're happy to have her on tonight.  Anne thanks so much for coming on. So it seems worse since we -- you know we've gone through day after day of hearing talking about Amy Barrett's legal philosophy getting a sense of what she is like as a person since you've known her for decades we thought we'd ask you.  Anne Falgoust AMY CONEY BARRETT'S BEST FRIEND IN COLLEGE: Well I thought first of all thanks for having me on. I thought she was absolutely superb the past few days in the hearings. She demonstrated her high intellect. She was humble. It comes across very very well to everyone.  I saw some polling today saying that across party lines support for her has grown in the country. And she is -- you know she is a faithful Catholic but she shouldn't be attacked for that. There's no religious test in this country for public office and it shouldn't be an issue.  CARLSON: So when religious people live in general much happier more productive lives add rather than detract in what world is that a bad thing?  FALGOUST: I mean most of the people in this country are religious and live religious lives. I think that there are a lot of people in this country on both sides of the coast for example who have gotten away from that but they miss what's happening in most of the country even at our own college at Rhodes College we had a group of alum come out and say and call her a theocratic bigot. They wanted the college to disavow her as an alum. One of our most prestigious alums of all time if not the most.  So a few of us who know Amy very well started ‘Alumni for Amy’  to get some signatures and send them today to the Senate Judiciary Committee on her behalf including Justice Scalia's grandson who is a 2018 graduate of Rhodes College. And you know we're still taking signatures through her confirmation but we just wanted to show the Senate Judiciary we want to show Rhodes College we want to show Amy that we're behind her.  It's a bipartisan letter it goes back and talks about how wonderful she is as a person the achievements that she has attained in her life. You know at Rhodes she was on the Honor Council which is a big deal. We voted her on junior year and senior year from our class and then our senior year she was voted school campus wide to be the Vice President.  CARLSON: Interesting. Well she has continued on that trajectory. Anne thank you for that.  FALGOUST: Yes.  CARLSON: Great to see you tonight. That was hurtful about college alums.  FALGOUST: Thank you.  CARLSON: Thank you. Well when you vote if you vote in person the first Tuesday in November you'll see a lot of names on the ballot. A lot of people running for President and actually one of them not one of the two big ones Kanye West and he has just released a new campaign ad.  Unlike most campaign ads it's actually worth watching. We wouldn't show it to you if it wasn't so suspend disbelief for a second. Stick with us.  We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  CARLSON: Well Kanye West is still running for President. He is actually qualified for the ballot in more than a dozen states. He is not going to win most likely. But he has made a brand new campaign ad that we want to show you.  As you watch it ask yourself why other politicians don't sound more like this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  KANYE WEST RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We as a people will revive our nation's commitment to faith. Faith can be restored.  We as a people are called to a greater purpose than ourselves. We are not only a beacon to the world but we should be servants to each other to encourage each other to help each other to lift up each other.  Our fellow Americans we will build a stronger country by building stronger families. Families are the building blocks of society of a nation.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  CARLSON: Families are the foundation the building blocks of a society of a nation. Yes he is crazy.  By the way his campaign is also selling shirts that say God save America.  He has tweeted repeatedly on topics that most politicians won't get anywhere near like abortion and how it affects the black community.  Why is he the only one talking like this? And why is everyone ignoring him?  Candace Owens is a senior writer at Townhall author of ""Blackout: How Black America Can Make its Second Escape from the Democratic Plantation.""  We're happy to have her on tonight.  So Candace Owens without even getting into you know the political facts or you know who he draws from or whatever just the message of the Kanye West campaign. It seems like most people would agree with that. Why is nobody paying attention this and why is nobody copying it?  CANDACE OWENS AUTHOR ""BLACKOUT"": Well I will say full disclosure I am personal friends with Kanye West and I will say that when he first came out as a Trump supporter a couple of years ago I was so disappointed in the reaction that we got from both the left and the right.  You know the left dismissed him as a race traitor which is very typical and the righteous called him crazy. And Kanye West is actually neither.  This is a man that is using his billion dollar platform to talk about issues that are actually impacting all Americans but especially black Americans things that I say right?  What is it about these progressive platforms that always lead to progressive results for the black community? Progressive stance on abortion right? The slaughtering of millions of black babies that disproportionately impacts black America progressive stance on the Black Lives Matter platform.  When Black Lives Matter arrives in the city it destroys black communities.  That's another progressive platform. Defund the police. That's a progressive movement right? What has it led to? An increase of something like 200 percent in inner cities in shootings that have happened since this time last year?  So Kanye West you know I understand that for a lot of people they are uncomfortable with him because stylistically he is different. It's not what we're used to in politics.  Trump is not what we're used to in politics but I will say this what has what we are used to actually bought us? If Kanye West is crazy what is the correct adjective Tucker for Cory Booker for Kamala Harris for Joe Biden?  CARLSON: I totally agree. For all these people. That is totally right. I mean Kanye West is the only one who said the obvious which is they can say they love you but if they are putting abortion clinics in your neighborhood maybe they're not sincere. If they don't want you to have more children maybe they don't really love you.  OWENS: Right.  CARLSON: Like that's not crazy. It's the opposite of crazy. It's true.  OWENS: Right and you know I'm seven months pregnant right now Tucker with my first child. It's unconscionable to me that the Democratic platform stands on believing that at seven months pregnant I have the right right now to choose. You know it's not a life it's not a life.  I can get -- I can I have two more months to decide whether or not I want this child and then beyond that and these are really important topics.  We're talking about things that are scary something that you never thought we'd ever be discussing before in America.  You know what? They've pushed this now to nine months being able to abort a child out of its womb and not only are they -- they're not shy about this.  Remember Andrew Cuomo lit up the city pink when they passed this policy in New York City.  So these are -- I think Kanye West the only word is brave. I think he is incredibly brave because he has risked his entire professional platform and professional life to come out and to say these things.  CARLSON: I totally agree. He is saying things we should all be saying without apology or embarrassment but we're too afraid and we need people like that more of him.  Candice Owens congratulations on your baby and thanks for coming on.  OWENS: Thank you.  CARLSON: Well you may have heard word of something called The Great Barrington Declaration. It proposes an alternative to the coronavirus lockdowns that our public health experts have imposed on us. They are ignoring the statement. It's made Tony Fauci pretty upset too. We'll talk to one of the authors of that Declaration next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  CARLSON: So the science shows that the overwhelming majority of people who contact the Wuhan coronavirus survive it and when we say overwhelming majority we mean overwhelming for people under 50. It's 99.9 percent.  Lockdowns on the other hand affect everyone regardless of age and it shows. Rates of suicide and depression have soared in this country. Drug abuse too.  Earlier this month several scientists authored a document called The Great Barrington Declaration you should read it. It's sensible. It's smart. It's moderate.  The document advocates for allowing healthy young people to live their lives normally. Let's not kill them.  The theory is that people who contract an infection then build up an immunity which actually reduces the overall spread of the virus. Our public health experts have mocked that idea. Tony Fauci who they say is a genius has called this idea quote ""total nonsense.""  Dr. Jay Bhattacharya is a Professor of Medicine at Stanford University. He is one of the authors of the Declaration and he joins us tonight. Doctor thanks so much for coming on.  So if you would just summarize your position. I think The Great Barrington Declaration has been characterized in a bunch of different ways by partisans. So I'd like to hear you describe what it is.  DR. JAY BHATTACHARYA PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE STANFORD UNIVERSITY: Yes I think so the key idea of The Great Barrington Declaration"" is that there's a thousand-fold difference in the risk of mortality for people who are older for whom COVID-19 is actually a deadly disease you know 95 percent survive but there is still five percent who die let's say you're 70.  Whereas for younger people it's much less deadly. So for instance for children there have been many more flu deaths this year than COVID-19 deaths. So people under as you say have very very high survival rate for people who are who are who are younger.  And then you combine that with the fact that the lockdowns have been absolutely deadly deadly in the United States as you say. So for instance the C.D.C. found in June that one in four young adults had seriously considered suicide which is an astronomically high number.  Putting kids out of school is bad for kids' health. Of course for their education as well. The people have skipped cancer appointments because they're more afraid of COVID than cancer. Just -- it's bad for people's health all the way across domestically.  Internationally it is devastating. A hundred and thirty million additional people the U.N. estimates will starve this year as a consequence of the economic collapse caused by the lockdowns. An additional 400000 tuberculosis patients will die worldwide. It just -- it's mind boggling the cost of the lockdowns and it hits the poor the hardest -- the poor the working class.  We designate certain class of workers as vulnerable or as essential and yet if you are a 63-year-old-bus driver we ask you to go expose yourself to COVID to earn a living.  The argument for The Great Barrington Declaration is we should take the money we're spending to address COVID and protect the vulnerable whoever you are whether you're older protect nursing homes I think we started to do a better job at that but we can keep continuing to do that.  We use tests and all the standard mechanisms to do that there provide accommodation laws so that you don't -- if you're 63 you don't have to teach in -- you can you can teach on Zoom but if you're younger you can teach it in person.  If you're a bus driver you have some other sort of disability accommodation so you don't have to be exposed with community spread.  CARLSON: What you just said is that sparklingly sensible. I wish she'd been in charge and I wish we had more time. It is The Great Barrington Declaration and I encourage all of our viewers to look it up.  Dr. Bhattacharya thank you so much for coming on tonight.  BHATTACHARYA: Please do sign.  CARLSON: And sign as well.  BHATTACHARYA: Thank you.  CARLSON: I think it's worth it. Great to see you.  Thanks for watching tonight. We're out of time.  We will be back tomorrow night 8:00 p.m. the show that's a sworn enemy of lying pomposity smugness and groupthink.  The Great Sean Hannity right now.

314,How Facebook staffer could 'reduce circulation' of Hunter Biden exposé," This is a rush transcript from “Hannity"" October 15 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome to ""Hannity."" Breaking moments ago NBC fake news did their best to just ambush President Trump at tonight's town hall. He pretty much debated Savannah Guthrie. And what we all witnessed was not journalism. It was a political debate with the morning host of ""The Today Show"" serving as -- well Joe Biden's surrogate and it didn't really work out well for her. Questions topics tactics all reeking of nothing but pure political bias of course. In the first few minutes the president was once again asked for the 400 millionth time to repeat what he has said over and over again to condemn white supremacy. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SAVANNAH GUTHRIE NBC NEWS ANCHOR: You were asked point blank to denounce white supremacy. In the moment you didn't. You're asking follow-up questions who specifically? A couple of days later on a different show you denounced white supremacy. My question to you is -- DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No you always do this. You've done this to me and everybody -- GUTHRIE: -- why doesn't seem like -- TRUMP: I denounced white supremacy OK? GUTHRIE: You did two days later.TRUMP: I denounce white supremacy for years but you always do it. You always start off with the question.GUTHRIE: Well -- TRUMP: You didn't ask Joe Biden whether or not he denounces Antifa. I watched him in the same basic show with Lester Holt and he was asking questions like Biden was a child.GUTHRIE: Well so this is a little bit of a dodge -- TRUMP: Are you listening? I denounce white supremacy.GUTHRIE: OK.TRUMP: What's your next question?GUTHRIE: Do you feel -- it feels sometimes you're hesitant to do so like you wait -- TRUMP: Here we go again. Every time in fact my people came I'm sure they'll ask you the white supremacy question. I denounce white supremacy.GUTHRIE: OK.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Savannah you need to get out of the New York liberal elitist out of touch bubble that you're living in and maybe you read some other news or take a step outside the far left enclave that is conspiracy TV MSNBC DNC President Trump has condemned Savannah white supremacy over and over and over and over again. And if you didn't know you should have known. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Have you ever heard this president say one negative thing about white supremacists? Have you ever heard it? TRUMP: I totally disavow the Ku Klux Klan. I totally disavow David Duke.BIDEN: I got back in this race because what happened in Charlottesville people coming out of the woods carrying torches their veins bulging close your eyes and remember what you saw. And a young woman gets killed resisting the hate and violence and the president gets asked to comment in and what's he say? He says they're very fine people on both sides.TRUMP: And you had some very bad people in that group but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. And I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally.BIDEN: He wouldn't even condemn David Duke for god's sake.TRUMP: I reject David Duke rejected David Duke. I've rejected the KKK the Ku Klux Klan from the time I'm five years old I rejected them.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: At this point the abusively biased NBC just using white supremacy lie is their way again once again always again to smear the president. They don't care about facts. They don't care about research. They don't care about truth. They don't care about fundamental fairness especially not MSDNC news which is completely corrupt as we saw tonight. It is a conspiratorial wing of the DNC and basically nothing but state-run television they're actively working to elect Sleepy Joe Biden and Guthrie's own husband was Al Gore's traveling chief of staff what a shock.And needless to say this event which was billed as a town hall was nothing more than a contentious political debate with Guthrie interrupting the president again and again and again all in the name of fairness. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I felt really good -- GUTHRIE: Did the doctors ever tell you that they saw pneumonia on your lungs scans?TRUMP: No but they said the lungs are you know a little bit different a little bit perhaps infected and -- GUTHRIE: Infected with?TRUMP: I don't know. I tested positive and -- GUTHRIE: Let's talk about testing because there's a little bit of a -- I guess confusion about this.TRUMP: I had no problem before.GUTHRIE: Did you test the day off the debate?TRUMP: You can't let this continue to go on with the lockdowns and I believe that cities that are run by Democrats who don't know what they're doing -- GUTHRIE: All right. While we're denouncing let me ask you about QAnon.TRUMP: I know nothing about QAnon.GUTHRIE: I just told you. TRUMP: I know very little. You told me but what you tell me doesn't necessarily make it fact I hate to say that.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: I know nothing about QAnon. By the way I've had people try to explain it to me I have no clue what this thing is.Do you think that Biden's receiving the same treatment over at ABC? Of course not and I'm sure former Clinton hack George Stephanopoulos is giving him the white glove treatment although reports tonight Joe Biden completely melting down.Joining us now with more is FOX News contributor and of course former -- well White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.I mean I know you've done this job. I know you've dealt with the media as corrupt and liberal as they are and I'm sitting there and I'm watching this I'm like oh why don't we just have Joe Biden's campaign write the questions and argue the debate for Savannah Guthrie? It was that obvious. ARI FLEISCHER FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You know Sean I spent 21 years in Washington as a press secretary and I've always known Republicans of an uphill fight. We have to be smarter. We have to work twice as hard as Democrats. Democrats get softball questions. Republicans get hardball questions.But then Donald Trump came along and anything I thought was hard it's almost impossible for Trump. I mean the bias of the media and the way they come at him I watched the ABC town hall because I wanted to see how biased it might be I wanted to see the type of questions the audience was asking. I can tell you this because I watched a little bit of Savannah during commercials she interrupted Donald Trump more in seconds than George Stephanopoulos did to Joe Biden in 60 minutes.I mean one was an interrogation the NBC interview of Donald Trump and the other was a picnic in the park the ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos totally different want to challenge a president the other to elect the president. That's the difference.HANNITY: Okay. So but I thought with all of that said the president said okay I'll answer it again. I condemn it again. So then -- I thought one of the funny -- oh well you know all about the QAnon and he said not really I really don't -- yes you do. I'm like what does she know about? Do you know anything about it because they write all the time that I know all about and I don't know all about it?I just don't.(LAUGHTER)FLEISCHER: I -- I'm in the same category. I've heard of them mostly just because of Twitter but I pay no attention to them. I know they're conspiracy theorists and I don't like conspiracy theorists.But this drive to get Trump to say things that he's already said why doesn't anybody -- Trump's right ask Joe Biden about Antifa? George Stephanopoulos did not ask him to denounce Antifa by name tonight. I could go through with you with the list of things that George Stephanopoulos did not ask Joe Biden about starting with ""The New York Post"" story a very simple question could have been -- did you yes or no ever meet with anybody from Burisma? Their email saying that you did. Are those emails false or did you have such a meeting? What do you think of big tech censoring anybody who wants to talk about ""The New York Post"" story?None of that brought up tonight by George Stephanopoulos.HANNITY: You know I watch all of this but at the end of the day I -- as I watched the president when they finally got to the point where he was interacting with the was supposed to be a town hall with people -- even people that maybe were leaning towards Biden you could just see that the president has this uncanny ability to warmly connect with people. You know now does he fight? Yeah. Does he battle? Yeah.But didn't that fighting battle lead to him keeping his promises on tax cuts and building the wall and ending bureaucracy and getting us energy independence and better trade deal and beating the caliphate and Soleimani and Baghdadi and the al Qaeda leader in Yemen? So on the one hand he's got both sides of this. Even the answer on COVID-19 he goes yeah I guess I could be hiding in the basement or in a room somewhere but I've got to be the president I've committed to serve this country and that takes leadership. What do you think?FLEISCHER: Yeah and I think this is going to be one of the great issues after election day he has to fight he has to battle. But Sean I've always made the case he has to dial it down a notch or two. He has to fight more than anybody because the deck is so stacked against him but I also think he can fight so hard sometimes that he turns people off and he's done sometimes on Twitter he's done sometimes in the direct things he said and that's a tonal question. I don't think he wants to turn it down. And I worry about that because I do think that's hurt him particularly with a lot of suburban women a lot of people who used to be Republicans who aren't Republican they're not comfortable with him. Is he too hot to handle? So he has to find that line between being himself being the tough guy the fighter but not go too far. (CROSSTALK)HANNITY: See I felt he hit that back -- it was funny because I've listened to you say that and I felt he hit that balance tonight. I felt it was okay-- FLEISCHER: Okay.HANNITY: Okay Savannah I'll answer the question for the 400th time answers it she's arguing she's interruptive answers it again. But then when the audience questions came in that's where the connection took place and I thought he was sharpening his case. FLEISCHER: In fairness I watched Biden tonight I wasn't able to watch very much of Trump. I did that on purpose.HANNITY: The weak the frail the ever confused Joe Biden. But okay thanks Ari Fleischer. We appreciate it.Also tonight serious claims of public corruption continue to now emerge surrounding Joe Biden and of course zero experience Hunter his son. As we speak Twitter Facebook are actively shielding and protecting the Biden campaign. The social media giants even froze the accounts of prominent Republicans who dared to mention Hunter's alleged corruption including White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. She was on this program last night.There are going calls now for major platforms to lose what are special legal protections not afforded to traditional media outlets once they editorialize or once they decide to edit and decide what the content is going to be or what their approval is based on political opinion.Now Twitter and Facebook if they want to act like MSDNC they should be treated like MSDNC because let's be clear there are serious questions tonight surrounding zero experience Hunter his father whether Twitter thinks so or not whether Facebook thinks so or not these questions must be answered. Joe did you ever talk to your son about his overseas businesses because you said you didn't but in fact we now know you did? Did you participate in any way in any of those business endeavors? Because remember on multiple occasions Biden promised he never once spoke to his son about his unusual international business deals. There are now emails that say just the opposite. Twitter apparently doesn't want any of those questions asked or answered because instead of allowing further discussion Twitter tried to banish the topic from its platform. Oh sounds like another campaign contribution to Joe Biden.Facebook actively limiting its distribution.Well today Senator Ted Cruz summed it up pretty effectively. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): And let me be very clear Twitter is interfering in this election. They are censoring the press. When it comes to Joe Biden Twitter has decided that they are using their multi-billion dollar monopoly power to try to silence all discussion and keep the voters ignorant. It is-- big tech censorship has always been bad but they really crossed the line in the last 24 hours.I'm not aware of their previously actively censoring major press outlets.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Senator Cruz is right. For these tech giants it is not about right versus wrong or facts versus lies. It's not about the quality or journalistic integrity of a report. Instead it's for them basically a campaign contribution and they too are an extension of the DNC and Biden camp in terms of their press office and of course going after Donald Trump and protecting all things Biden.Make no mistake Twitter Facebook they are not arbiters of truth cold calculated political actors. As a matter of fact the biggest campaign donors in this election cycle will be the media mob and yes social media outlets. The Federalists pointed out 11 major separate hacks leaks hoaxes that Twitter and Facebook didn't throttle because they were after Donald Trump. For example Twitter totally fine with users publishing illegal unsourced leaks of Trump's phone call with the president of Ukraine. Also fine with the illegally leaked unsourced purported Trump tax returns. They were fined with the legal leak of a Flynn phone call that resulted in his unmasking. That would be a serious felony. They were fine with the tweets that were spreading Steele's dirty unverified now we know Russian misinformation dossier. They were perfectly fine with untrue and baseless smears against Justice Kavanaugh. They were fine with the slander of Nicholas Sandmann. And a day after blocking the Hunter Biden story Twitter allowed the hashtag Eric Trump's Ukraine scandal to trend even though there is no Eric Trump Ukraine scandal.And get this Twitter is even allowing propaganda from Iran and China and state-run media accounts from them and the list goes on and on. And this by the way brings us to something known as Section 230. You need to be familiar with it. It is a legal liability shield that many major social media companies like Twitter like Facebook currently enjoy. And by the way that essentially protects them from being held liable from the content that is posted by their users. Now by -- there are now calls for that protection to be stripped away. They should be stripped away. If Twitter and Facebook they're going to editorialize and censor one political party over another and advocate one political candidate over another then perhaps they should be treated the same as every other media outlet. For example you got Humpty Dumpty over at fake news CNN -- I know he's listening and watching. He's obsessed -- he was forced to settle at his network with the Covington high school student Nicholas Sandmann after getting sued for slandering him on the air the entire network CNN. Not Humpty.Twitter and Facebook faced no such suit because of Section 230. That protection could soon come to an end if the two companies continue to censor content based on their obvious liberal and Joe Biden bias. Meanwhile most media mob outlets have been doing their very best to ignore any and all stories about zero experience Hunter. In fact multiple outlets were actually cheering the big tech censorship including ""The New York Times"".And tonight regardless of what Twitter and Facebook want you to see the facts are clear. Hunter Biden -- look at Ron Johnson who was on this program last night -- he made millions of dollars while his father was vice president. Much of that money for example someone supplied by a Ukrainian oligarch. In another case a Russian oligarch former -- oh first lady of Moscow. In another case to buy a new car with a Kazakh oligarch as well as connected members of China's communist party. They even got to go on a hundred thousand dollar family spending spree.You have Chinese nationals Russian nationals Kazakh nationals Ukrainian nationals -- why would all of these uber wealthy well-connected foreign nationals be given zero experience Hunter billions of dollars? Don't forget $1.5 billion deal with the Bank of China with no experience? ""GMA"" Hunter said well you have any experience in oil? No. Gas? No. Energy? No. Ukraine? No.Why do you think that they paid you millions of dollars? I don't know. Maybe because your father is vice president in charge of Ukraine? Probably.In that case Hunter was actually truthful and correct. Now it's time for Joe to answer what did you really know when did you know it and did you even financially benefit from it?And joining us now is the senator was long called for big tech companies to be held accountable and he's pushing for leaders of Twitter and Facebook to be brought before Congress next week Missouri Senator Josh Hawley.Senator okay they have this Section 230 protection against liability but they're editorializing they're deciding what content is good and bad and there is a massive political bias.SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Yeah so here's the thing Sean. What needs to happen is Americans need to be able to sue these companies. You know if you've been locked out of Twitter or if you can't to distribute this ""New York Post"" article on Facebook you ought to be able to sue `em. You could do that with another company but you can't do it with Facebook and Twitter and Google because of the special sweetheart deal they get from the federal government. And by the way that's how they've gotten so big and powerful. They haven't done this on their own. They've gotten to be these monopolies because the government 20 years ago gave them this sweetheart deal and it's time for it to end.HANNITY: OK. So you watch what happened here. All right we have Joe Biden on tape. Joe Biden bragging you're not getting a billion dollars I'm -- I'm leaving here in in six hours you're not getting the billion dollars -- he's telling this to Ukraine -- unless you fire the prosecutor. His name was Viktor Shokin. He has a name. He's given interviews who's investigating his son who's making millions with no experience.Now I don't know Senator. That sounds like a quid and a pro and a quo with Joe and millions of dollars going to somebody with zero experience.Now I'd like that deal. I bet you'd probably like that deal. I bet most of America would like that deal. But yet nobody in the media even discusses it or touches it. What if Hunter's last name was Trump? You think it would be different?HAWLEY: Yeah. Oh it'd be a heck of a lot different.By the way I love the media howling now about the fact that the emails that ""The New York Post"" published they said oh we don't know exactly where those are from. I didn't hear any such howling when ""The New York Times"" published Trump's tax returns which they almost certainly got illegally. Here's the point if those emails are fake if ""The New York Post"" emails are fake why isn't the Biden campaign out there denying it? And the biggest point of all is why is Facebook and Twitter why are they doing the bidding of the Biden campaign? Why is it that Joe Biden can snap his fingers and these monopolies the biggest monopolies in America just do his bidding and refuse to allow this story to be reported?Now you've got these tech companies trying to control journalism trying to control news trying to control what Americans can talk about in a presidential election? And we've only got 19 days to go.It's unbelievable. It's a racket. It's collusion between Biden and the big tech companies and it's got to stop.HANNITY: All right. We're going to watch it closely.All right. As you watch the race unfold even with all of the bias how do you assess? There are a lot of tough Senate races. For example Martha McSally Corey Gardner Joni Ernst Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham Senator Perdue Tillis.A lot is hanging in the balance here. How do you see the election with 19 days to go?HAWLEY: I think we're going to hold the Senate. Well it's going to be tight election there's no doubt about it.HANNITY: Susan Collins yeah.HAWLEY: The big tech putting their finger on the -- on the scale. Yeah that's right there's a lot of tough races out there but we are going to hold the Senate.Of course I firmly believe the president is going to be re-elected. My home state of Missouri he's going to win big. So I think the president's going to get reelected. I believe we will hold the Senate.And Sean we've got to take action right now to hold these big tech companies accountable. They are going to continue to do this. If we don't stop them now if Republicans don't stand up and do something about this these companies are going to run this country. That's their desire. These woke capitalists they want to run America. Big government big tech they want to run America. We've got to stop them. We've got to do something right now.HANNITY: All right. Senator thank you. We got a lot of ground to cover tonight. Apparently Joe Biden open to packing the United States Supreme Court. We have all the details.And coming up Hollywood liberals members of the mob and the media have an absolute meltdown over NBC actually doing a town hall with President Trump even though it's abusively biased. We got the tape.And C-Span suspending Steve Scully indefinitely after it was revealed that he lied about being hacked on Twitter. The great one Mark Levin weighs in on that and more.The fascinating thing what about the Commission on Presidential Debates that said that they are so fair? No they're not. We'll explain straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: All right. Now the mob the media they're actually turning on each other after NBC agreed to do a town hall with President Trump. Oh my gosh they let him talk. Not really though. At the same time as the ever weak frail forgetful Joe Biden on ABC prompting outrage among the Biden adoring fans and the media mob. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RACHEL MADDOW MSNBC HOST: Are you as mad as everybody else's that NBC is doing a town hall with President Trump tomorrow instead of the debate at the same time that Vice President Biden's going to be on ABC?SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm not touching that.(LAUGHTER)CHRIS CUOMO CNN HOST: The dueling town halls.DON LEMON CNN HOST: Yes why on earth would NBC agree to do that?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So that sells it. Now I know what I'm going to do I'm going to vote for both of them right? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I guess.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks NBC. First ""The Apprentice"" now this. Why not a new Bill Cosby special while we're at it?(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And by the way as the Hollywood hate machine also smeared the event claiming that it was a threat to democracy and of course only in far left Hollywood would this be considered a scandal. Also breaking tonight just when you thought the media mob's behavior couldn't get any more bizarre Steve Scully -- you know the guy from C- Span one you're supposed to be fair and down the middle that was scheduled to moderate the second debate Commission on Presidential Debates he's been suspended indefinitely by C-Span because he had to admit that he lied about being hacked. I guess he was communicating with our old friend Anthony Scaramucci following that well tweet to Anthony last week.Let me be clear this isn't a scandal for Scully. It's an embarrassment for the Debate Commission they're supposed to be a non-partisan organization. It's also a scandal for the mob and the media which largely defended Scully. I've met the guy. He's actually a nice guy but now being forced to backtrack.For example fake news CNN's Humpty the Dumpty Brian Stelter called a quote true WTF despite Stelter Humpty himself ignoring the scandal on his own show. Well now in reaction President Trump tweeted quote: I was right again. Steve Scully just admitted he was lying about his Twitter account being hacked. The debate was rigged.Here now FOX News contributor Mike Huckabee along with media reporter for ""The Hill"" Joe Concha author of ""Don't Lie to Me"" the host of ""Justice"" Judge Jeanine Pirro.Governor Huckabee you've been in these debates. You know it's always a liberal media mob. Savannah Guthrie was so bad tonight the fact that she doesn't know that the president has condemned again and again and again white supremacy David Duke white nationalism asking you do know about QAnon. Governor maybe you could tell me if you know because people have tried to explain it to me and I still have no earthly idea what this thing is.MIKE HUCKABEE FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't know who follows it. I don't. You don't. The president doesn't.What happened tonight was just shameful and it was one more reminder that she was not a moderator she was a participator. And if she wants to debate Donald Trump let her get her name on the ballot she can go out there like the rest of us have done find out how unpleasant experience that can be and let her debate Donald Trump.But that's what I'm so sick of. These debates are a joke. They're a TV show. They're designed to pick a winner. The winner has already been picked before it starts.And no less than Bob Dole who is one of the great statesmen of our time -- I love Senator Dole and he's such a true American hero and statesman. And he said that he knows all the Republicans on this debate commission and not one of them would vote for Trump.So I -- they've been outed. It's just shameful.One final thing I want to mention is that the little gentleman over at CNN that you mentioned he said this is terrible Steve Scully being outed for lying because it means that the media reputation will be lower. And I tweeted out this afternoon it can't get any lower.HANNITY: Yeah it can't.HUCKABEE: It's as low as it can get.HANNITY: It's about as low as it can be which is a really good point.Judge I see you laughing.(LAUGHTER)JEANINE PIRRO FOX NEWS HOST ""JUSTICE"": Well it's true. I mean they lie to us all the time and I'm just tired of their lying. You know think about it Sean the fact that you've got the -- people on television and the Hollywood types who are saying you know by allowing the president of the United States to actually have a forum to talk to the American people is dividing the country it's making people choose. This is a horrible thing to do. They want to decide what we should hear if we should hear it and when we should hear it. This is a classic example of fascism. We're seeing it in social media. We're seeing it on the left. We're seeing the lunacy of the left where people on the view the women are saying this is the president trying desperately to avoid talking about people dying of the coronavirus.You know these people have lost it. They've absolutely lost it. And in the end they shouldn't be upset because according to their own polls there are double digits ahead of Donald Trump.But they're so worried that Donald Trump will sound smarter look smarter be able to complete a sentence that Joe Biden's still stuttering on his first sentence when Donald Trump has answered five questions.HANNITY: Well I'll actually I actually happen to be in favor. Let's eliminate the format you have one guy that does one thing or person -- well guy or girl I don't care. One per -- and that is moderate the time and make sure that each candidate in an hour and a half gets equal time. Short of that everybody shut up and let them have at it.Joe Concha what do you think? Good idea bad idea?JOE CONCHA MEDIA REPORTER FOR ""THE HILL"": I agree with that completely. Let them have at it. Take the moderator out all together because we can't trust the process at this point.Let's look at this story by the way all right? Particularly a lesson on bias of omission. CNN MSNBC all the major news outlets did not cover the Scully allegation when it first happened in terms of him claiming that he was hacked. Okay they didn't cover the story they covered for Steve Smollett -- I'm sorry Scully I don't know how that word got in my head.And now look what we have here all right?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Just blame Twitter say Twitter did it you say your brain was hacked you'll be fine.CONCHA: Yeah good point. Look the bottom line is there there was a tell here. We talked about it last week Sean right? Steve Scully never put out a statement denying it. Boy that's a big tell right?And if I'm a hacker and I get into a presidential debate moderators account the first thing I'm going to do and the only thing I'm going to do is send out the Scaramucci tweet so that didn't make any mistake. That didn't make any sense whatsoever.But the Debate Commission here they canceled so quickly on the second debate didn't they? They didn't even consult with the campaigns as far as okay can we find another date here? Remember 75 million people watched these debates and they pulled out so fast after this Scully controversy emerged because they realized that this could be a problem because he's probably lying based on all the things that I said here.So the bottom line is in retrospect the vetting process -- (CROSSTALK)HANNITY: I don't even want the guy fired.CONCHA: Let me finish when the moderators -- when the moderator puts out a tweet in 2016 of an op-ed from ""The New York Times"" saying -- HANNITY: Exactly.CONCHA: -- no not Trump not ever that should be it. He should not moderate the debate. PIRRO: Right.CONCHA: When he interned for Joe Biden when he worked for Ted Kennedy all those things that's it. He doesn't get to moderate the debate. The bottom line is Steve Scully is now suspended indefinitely. His career may be over for all we know with C-Span.Meanwhile MSNBC's Joy Reid she gets a promotion after lying about being hacked on her Twitter account. And that tells me -- (CROSSTALK)HANNITY: I might be the most liberal person on this panel tonight.CONCHA: -- media today.HANNITY: I think Scully should come out and apologize and if he means it is sincere why do you want to see the guy's career get blown up I'm not in favor of -- yeah I just don't know get.CONCHA: But he victimizes himself Sean.HANNITY: But you're right he never should have been picked which is your point and I agree with.And Governor Huckabee I don't know maybe I'm feeling very generous tonight my liberalness -- PIRRO: Yeah more.HANNITY: -- I actually think Savannah Guthrie being abusively biased and interruptive as she was tonight gave the president a great opportunity to show okay look at the media for who they are because they are the biggest contributors to Joe Biden and all things Democratic Party today.HUCKABEE: Well you can't hit a home run off a slow pitch. You know you want the fastball that's where you hit the home runs into the third deck.The president denied racism and white supremacy over 20 times on video and if she didn't know that she is terribly ill-prepared for the debate.You are 100 percent right about getting rid of the debate moderator. You don't need one turn a clock on. Every candidate gets the same amount of time if they interrupt another candidate. That goes against their time.Lincoln Douglas didn't have a moderator. You know we've not gotten better with presidential debates we've gotten worse.HANNITY: I'd like to see the president challenge Joe. No moderator two hours and see if Joe can take the heat. Under those circumstances just get equal amount of time.At the end of the day Mr. President goodbye he's got 15 more minutes. That's how you do it or Joe you're done your time is up.All right. Thank you all.Boy by the way also tonight Joe Biden is getting a softball town hall interview over at ABC apparently a complete disaster. Again Biden tonight looking weak and frail and stumbling over many of the answers. He's flipped and flopped on fracking yet again. He even said tonight he's -- I'm against packing the court but I'm open to it. I'll consider it.He said voters deserve to know the position and they'll find out after he sees what happens with Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation. Oh now we got an earlier date.And of course not one question about zero experience Hunter and all these shady overseas business deals.Here to react to all of it he's wound up tonight. He authored the number one bestseller ""Unfreedom of the Press"" host of ""Life Liberty &amp; Levin"" right here on FOX. It's number one show at 8:00 p.m. Sunday night the great one.Well I guess there's nothing much to talk about Mark. I guess good to see you.MARK LEVIN FOX NEWS HOST ""LIFE LIBERTY &amp; LEVIN"": Good to see you Sean.You know I think the question for Joe Biden shouldn't be -- not do you denounce white supremacy but are you still a white supremacist? I think that would be a very good question for Joe Biden. Maybe Ms. Guthrie would ask that of him.And Steve Scully -- Steve Scully don't feel sorry for him. He's got jobs lined up I'm sure at CNN and MSNBC. That Wolf Blitzer looks a little long in the tooth maybe he could replace his slot.I want to get into this -- this corrupt the family -- the Biden mob family and the patriarch Joe Biden who doesn't know anything that's going on everything's going on around him all kinds of countries involved all kinds of businesses millions and millions of dollars coming into his family but Joe doesn't know anything. Anybody believe it? Let me read this. This almost sounds like a Valentine Sean. Dear Hunter thank you for inviting me to D.C. and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spend some time together. It sounds like a girlfriend doesn't it? Spend some time together. It's really an honor and a pleasure. But it wasn't a girlfriend. It was the number two executive at Burisma.Now why is this important? I want to keep it simple. Not a lot of complicated names and everything else. Joe Biden said he didn't have the foggiest idea repeatedly what his son was doing with Ukraine or Burisma. You know he's busy he's vice president busy screwing up the swine flu and screwing up the economy he doesn't have time for his son.He doesn't ask his son where'd you get all this money? What'd you do today? How's your career? Not a word apparently very strange group.Okay Joe Biden has said he didn't know anything. But then a few months later he makes a call to the prosecutor in the Ukraine and basically says hey layoff -- basically says you are to quit or you're to be fired otherwise we're going to hold -- withhold a billion dollars from you. And he says one has nothing to do with the other the media jump in and they say well the European Union didn't want him anyway the prosecutor.You know there can be two truths at the same time. Maybe the European Union didn't want the prosecutor but clearly the Biden family didn't want the prosecutor either.And so here's the problem Joe Biden is a liar. Joe Biden did know. He knew. He met with the guy.And let me tell you what the campaign said Biden's campaign wouldn't rule out the possibilities -- this is ""Politico"" left-wing ""Politico"" that the former vice president had some kind of informal interaction with this Ukrainian executive of Burisma which wouldn't appear on Biden's official schedule because the first lie that they came out with was he wasn't on the official schedule. Well of course he's not on the official schedule.But if you look at that schedule there's more than an 80-minute gap remember the Nixon tapes? There's like a two-hour gap in the morning and a two-hour gap in the afternoon. So that's not determinative.So did Biden talk to this guy or not? Well I think that's a perfectly good question.Now we have these emails. ""The New York Post"" puts them out. We know that the Silicon Valley's in the back pocket of Biden. We know that Facebook is corrupt. We know that Twitter's corrupt. They'd be happier in Red China because that's the kind of attitude that they have we got all that.But here the media in America you now have emails you have texts you have names you have dates you have times why the hell won't you follow up on it? I'll tell you why they won't follow up on it because they'll get answers they don't like.Now we're told well this must be Russian disinformation. Was it Russian disinformation about China too or is that China disinformation? And why is it that Hunter keeps showing up?And think about this for it to be Russian disinformation they would have to have a Hunter Biden's laptop given to this guy in Delaware. This guy in Delaware would have to sit on that laptop for three months Hunter Biden doesn't pick it up. It's got pictures of Hunter apparently having sex and doing drugs and 40000 emails that the Russians are very good apparently.And then this guy they must know that this guy's going to turn it over to the FBI they must know that this guy is going to call Rudy Giuliani's lawyer and they must know that's how it's going to work. How stupid is all this?The fact is Joe Biden is a liar and that family is corrupt and when it comes to China it's even worse. You want to look at those emails. Can we verify those emails? Well media go look at them.I spoke to Rudy Giuliani today said nobody's asked to look at them. You want to look at `em go ahead and look at `em. They talk about $10 million annually quote for introductions alone. This is Hunter Biden's -- even introductions alone. The chairman changed that deal -- this is a communist Chinese company -- after we met in Miami to a much more lasting and lucrative agreement to create a holding company 50 percent owned by me 50 percent owned by him. That would be the communist Chinese.We're talking about 2017 now. Biden's no longer vice president. What do they talk about there?Well Biden's going to get a piece of the action. Which Biden? Joe they talk about Joe getting a piece of the action. Is that true? I don't know. Will they ask him? Will they ask Joe Biden about it?And what do we get today? We get the typical ""Washington Post"" hit piece on who? Rudy Giuliani.You see the issue isn't Hunter Biden and Joe Biden and all the corruption and the millions of dollars. The issue is none of that. No the issue is not Rudy Giuliani. It's like the Russia hoax it's like all that stuff. Four former officials familiar with the matter say that the Russians were trying to get their claws into Rudy. No names speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information and conversations. The warnings to the White House -- so it's Rudy Giuliani that we have to watch out for.Now ladies and gentlemen here's the deal -- Rudy Giuliani is a good man and they can attack them all they want. It doesn't answer the emails. It doesn't answer the texts. One has nothing to do with the other.And you know what? Our president was impeached for a hell of a lot less than this a perfectly fine phone call. We've got text. We've got emails. We got DNA we got times we got dates.And the New York slimes and the Washington compost -- well they're protecting their boy Joe Biden. They're not interested. That's it.HANNITY: One other thing we did have Russian interference. Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian misinformation dossier. She paid for it.LEVIN: Yeah.HANNITY: They warned about it. Steele had an agenda. They knew that the source for the dossier was a known Russian contact for 10 years and they used it anyway.Thank you Great One.Coming up police car set a fire in Seattle with officers inside the car. Rick Leventhal has a report. Dan Bongino Matt Gaetz straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: A suspect has been arrested for carrying out a vicious attack against America's police officers. Again in Seattle it allegedly involves burning a police vehicle while an officer was inside the vehicle. Our own Rick Leventhal standing by from FOX News our West Coast bureau with the very latest. Rick wow. RICK LEVENTHAL FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Hey Sean.In the first two because after the death of George Floyd more than 725 police officers were injured in antipolice protests and many more have been hurt since then including nearly 500 in New York City. But this most recent attack happened in an alley in Seattle this afternoon. An officer responding to a call of a man brandishing a flaming piece of lumber.And when the cop rolled up the suspect through the blazing two-by-two into the patrol vehicle which caught fire with the officers still inside. An eyewitness says the officers opened fire on the assailant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The officers is sitting on the other side of the vehicle and he's actually firing shots as the vehicle was rolling the cop falls to the ground. Luckily it didn't roll over. (END VIDEO CLIP)LEVENTHAL: The suspect tried to flee but other police arriving on scene chased him into a nearby parking garage tased him and took him into custody. The injured officer was hospitalized with what were described as nonlife-threatening burns. His vehicle as you can see destroyed. Another example of the random dangers our police face every day and night in America with 32 officers fatally shot in the line of duty this year alone Sean. HANNITY: All right Rick. Prayers for the police officers everywhere under assault of an attack around the country. Thank you. Dueling town halls tonight over at well ABC. Biden is flip-flopping on fracking went unquestioned yet again -- once again asked that he was never for fracking. Biden can't seem to make up his mind on that issue.But during the primary he and Kamala Harris wanted to ban fracking. Now he is saying the opposite again. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I am not not not banning fracking period. But kiddo I want you to just take a look okay? You don't have to agree but I want you to look in my eyes. I guarantee you I guarantee you we are going to end fossil fuel and I am not going to cooperate with them okay? No more no new fracking. DEBATE MODERATOR: Will there be any place for fossil fuels including coal and fracking in a Biden administration? BIDEN: Now we would work it out. We would make sure it's eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Would you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office? Adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? HARRIS: There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking so yes. (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Yeah they'll want to ban fracking. Now we don't want to ban fracking because we want to win Pennsylvania and Ohio so we'll say whatever we need to say. Although Joe did admit tonight well I don't like the idea of court packing but I'm open to it. Joining us author of ""Follow the Money"" Dan Bongino author of ""Firebrand"" and that would describe him that's Matt Gaetz Florida congressman. All right. Joe doesn't have to answer questions about Hunter business dealing. He flips and flops and flails on fracking taxes the Supreme Court packing the Supreme Court.Matt your take? REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): The Joe Biden town hall I saw wasn't very much fun. You know Biden can't be the commander-in-chief. He can barely be the commander of a sentence. And time and again I think he was confronted with flip-flops and circumstances that confused his voters.And you compare that to the Trump town hall the president was not only in command and engaging he was incredibly charming whether it was with the mother and daughter where he talked about teaming up to win the daughter's vote or whether he was responding to frontline health care workers or people concerned about the economy. And I think one reason he was so charming is the Trump town hall was packed full of women. I mean there were more women in the Trump town hall than in a Bill Clinton hot tub and I think NBC News would've thought that was going to backfire on the president but in fact it gave him a platform to be able to show I think a real charming side of himself. HANNITY: Of course your book is called ""Firebrand."" Dan Bongino? DAN BONGINO FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well listen we know Biden is a con man and if these devastating emails are in fact confirmed and authenticated Sean Biden should really step out of the race. Oh my gosh you can't say that. I just did. Because it opens up a ton of questions that implicate us in national security questions we really don't want to think about like what else does China have on Joe Biden? HANNITY: Yeah -- BONGINO: What is you know 10 for Hunter -- what?HANNITY: I've got a break but you are 100 percent right. He's compromised -- straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right. Unfortunately that's all the time we have left 19 days you are the ultimate jury. Hope you set your DVR. Never miss an episode.Let not your heart be troubled. The butterball turkey fryer is in the mail on its way to Laura Ingraham's House. You were brutal last night. You are just brutal. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

315,Why are Twitter Facebook doing bidding of the Biden campaign?," Many Americans are voting early in the 2020 presidential election amid concerns regarding the coronavirus pandemic and U.S. Postal Service timing. More than 25.8 million total ballots cast as of Friday suggests a record turnout for this year's race compared to the 1.4 million ballots that were cast at a similar time in 2016 according to data from the United States Elections Project. ""That’s unprecedented in a modern election in the United States"" Elections Project founder and University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald wrote on the project website. He expects ""around 150 million people"" to vote in this year's election the ""highest turnout since 1908 of those eligible to vote."" That number of early ballots cast so far represents 18.6% of the total national voter turnout in 2016. Ten states however have already reached more than 30% of their 2016 voter tunrout as of Thursday including Texas (37.9%) South Dakota (32.8%) Minnesota (30.7%) Vermont (42.7%) Virginia (30.5%) Georgia (32%) and New Jersey (32.7%). Texas on Friday emerged with the largest voter turnout so far; nearly 3.4 million Texans have cast ballots so far. California and Florida trail just behind with 2.9 million and 2.4 million ballots cast respectively.  Swing state Michigan has also recorded more than a million submitted ballots; voter turnout reached nearly 1.4 million on Wednesday. Maryland New Jersey and Georgia have also counted more than a million ballots.  NJ JUDGE REJECTS TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S CHALLENGE TO STATE'S MAIL-IN VOTING PLANS McDonald said he ""expected some things to be different since states changed their laws"" to accommodate voters amid the pandemic. McDonald added that ""70 million mail-in ballots [are] expected to go out to voters"" ahead of Nov. 3. ""People did not have to take advantage of this"" he said of mail-in ballots and early voting. But many people already have. Ballot data is still unavailable in some states including Idaho New York Arkansas Missouri and Connectciut. California however has recorded the highest number of mail ballot requests at more than 21.5 million compared to Florida's 5.7 million as of Wednesday. Voters in Washington state have requested 4.6 million main-in ballots. Democrats have requested 23.5 million ballots while Republicans have requested nearly 13.1 million — a 10.3 million ballot request lead based on data from states reporting party registration including California Colorado the District of Columbia Flordia Iowa Maryland Maine North Carolina New Jersey Nevada Oregon Pennsylvania and Utah. PENNSYLVANIA DA FILES CHARGES AGAINST ELECTION JUDGE WHO ALLEGEDLY ALTERED PRIMARY BALLOTS Those ballot requests by party however may not be an accurate indicator of final election results McDonald's frequently asked questions page on the Elections Project website. ""Just because registered Democrats are leading Republicans in early voting that does not mean the Republicans will not make up ground on Election Day"" McDonald wrote adding that ""registered Democrats typically lead Republicans during early voting and Republicans vote on Election Day a pattern that persists across many states and elections."" McDonald shared two possible scenarios for this year's voter outcome. ""The first is that many voters...have successfully flattened the curve on mail-in ballots meaning election officials will be able to more accurately process ballots"" he said. ""The typical pattern is: We usually don’t see this rush at the beginning...early voting numbers are small and pick up closer to Election Day."" The second scenario he said is the U.S. ""following a typical pattern and as Election Day appears we’ll see unprecedented [in-person] turnout for the election.""

316,2020 presidential election ballots cast so far," Oct. 15 2020 – This is a rush transcript from “The Ingraham Angle” October 15 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM FOX NEWS HOST: All right I'm Laura Ingraham. This is ""The Ingraham Angle"" from D.C. tonight.  President Trump and Joe Biden just finished up these dueling town halls. I actually had one earbud in one ear and then I had the regular speakerphone in the other. I heard both at one time. That was fun. We're going to bring you exclusive reaction to tonight's events. Now throughout the hour we are going to hear from get this the White House and the Trump campaign. Plus my angle will expose the grifting elites who are profiting off your misery. But first let's get right to tonight's town halls. Almost every question to Donald Trump was combative or in some way adversarial. Savannah Guthrie acted as if she were Trump's debate partner not the moderator not an interviewer. And she clearly had to prove her liberal bona fides tonight. But I think in general she seems like a nice person but at times she came across just as another angry liberal hack. Her interjections seemed like sad attempts at I don't know it was like political point scoring not done for clarification purposes. Still even with these constant interruptions and what was obvious bias I think the president delivered a strong confident and very likable performance. Now you contrast that with Joe's town hall where almost every question was a softball or gave him an easy out. And Stephanopoulos did - he did occasionally interject with follow-ups but even when he did that the tone was always quite tender and the framing was ever so gentle. In Biden's performance it was OK. But at times it was uneven. And he lapsed into his comfort zone which I noticed I'm sure you did if you caught any of it of old storytelling about his childhood. And I don't think that seem to land very well. And let's be clear. The former VP might have cloaked his language around norms and unity. But what he was saying represents anything but that for you. He opened the door to packing the Supreme Court. He promoted a foreign policy that would subject us to the whims of the global order; and when it comes to the economy well wave goodbye to all those wage increases you saw on the first three years of Trump. Joining me now with exclusive reaction is White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow. Larry it's great to see you tonight. What is your message to the American people about what we heard tonight from Joe Biden specifically his hits on the Trump economy? LARRY KUDLOW WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER: Well look. I confess I spent more time watching President Trump maybe for obvious reasons. But I will tell you this. Mr. Biden is determined to rollback all the Trump tax-cuts and the deregulation. So they want to take control central planning control of the energy sector and the health care sector and elsewhere. That will decimate the economy. President Trump on the other hand made it very clear tonight by the way. He had a great optimistic message on the economy rebuilding America. He is going to cut taxes more he is going to deregulate more he is going to save oil and he is going to continue with good trade deals. The deal here is a choice. It's a very clear choice ok?  On the one hand you have from Mr. Biden stagnation recession pessimism.  On the other hand you have from President Trump optimism prosperity and growth. You couldn't be clearer. And unfortunately Mr. Biden fell into that trap. Fortunately for my life I'm not going to break news here I am for Trump. I think president was a commanding figure on the stage and I think he did a great job in the face of all these interruptions. He did a terrific job. INGRAHAM: All right let me get to some more of this Larry. We have limited time. We got limited time. So even with his notes in front of him Biden I noticed Larry still had some trouble getting the numbers right on taxes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I carry this card with me. When I said the tax - the Trump tax-cuts about $1.3 trillion of the $2 trillion in his tax-cuts went to the top one-tenth of 1 percent. That's what I'm talking about eliminating.  If you made sure that people making over 400 grand paid what they did in the Bush administration 39.6 percent you would raise another - this goes up to let me get you exact number here about another $200 - excuse me $92 billion. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: I guess Larry those were a lot of numbers to remember three numbers. But what of those numbers? He says he is just going to make things fairer. Larry people like all your friends on Wall Street they are just going to - they are going to pay their fair share. Warren Buffett will pay his fair share. KUDLOW: I fear my friends on Wall Street are for Biden but let's flip out a side.  INGRAHAM: Yes they are. I'm getting to that in next segment. KUDLOW: Look let me make something very clear. If you roll back if Biden rolls back the Trump tax cuts and deregulation the biggest losers will be the middle class. The fact is and the data show this census bureau labor statistics Federal Reserve board Trump's three years lower taxes and regulations the benefits went to those who needed the most the middle class and the lower wage earners. They were the biggest winners. If you roll that back they will be the biggest losers. And that's why this program from my friends on the other side of the aisle does not work. It is stagnation. Trump is growth and prosperity. INGRAHAM: Larry given the Gallup poll that found that 56 percent of Americans say they are better off than they were four years ago tonight a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll found that 50 percent said the same. I don't know what happened to those 6 percent. But then that same poll found that 58 percent say the country is worse off and trails Biden by 11. So where is the disconnect there? How does Trump - how is Trump behind if most people or half people think the country is doing better? What can you say accounts for that? KUDLOW: I don't know I don't know the inerts of this polling mechanism so it's very difficult. Here's what I know. Family income living standards real wages ok? Huge gains for POTUS' first three years.  INGRAHAM: $6000. KUDLOW: In the first three years he had about 6500 bucks five times the level increase of the whole eight of Biden and Obama. So that tells a story. Look across the board poverty down unemployment record down African-Americans Hispanic-Americans Asian-Americans women every class benefited more than ever before and more than the upper end the top 1 percent or the top 10 percent. They had less inequality because of the success of the economic program of President Trump. That is what we hope will happen it has happened and as we get through this pandemic it will happen again. Yes. INGRAHAM: And I would say to everybody out there remember it's not just that Trump's policies worked for the middle class and the working people he handled the fall-out from COVID better both the management of the disease as we are seeing what's happening in Europe. And also the economic fallout that Europe is reeling from we are recovering from because of Trump's smart handling of these policies. So Larry both the economy in the first three years and the recovery in the year of the pandemic without a doubt Trump is winning that huge. And that's what the American people I hope end up voting on. KUDLOW: We will we will. INGRAHAM: That's a great thing. We got to go. KUDLOW: We will keep the economy open. We will keep the economy open and the schools as well. INGRAHAM: Yes and Trump did not hit on those schools tonight which that was the only thing I would say he missed but moms want the schools open so do dads. Larry great to see you tonight. As I just said the other area of great concern for Americans is COVID and I highlighted this the last two nights really. We're lucky we didn't follow Europe's lead on tackling the pandemic. You remember all these people hailing Europe for its COVID response well the EU now is reporting substantially more daily COVID cases than we are something the president actually highlighted tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look at what's going on in Europe. Massive spikes. You take a look today at the UK you take a look at Spain and France and Italy there's tremendous spikes. And the United States is down 21 percent.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Now despite this Biden is still blaming President Trump for the outbreak. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BIDEN: What we should be doing now there should be a national standard instead of leaving us up to remember what did the president say to the governors well they are on their own that's not my responsibility. The governors can do what they need to do not my responsibility. It is the presidential responsibility to lead. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Joining me now is White House COVID advisor Dr. Scott Atlas. Dr.  Atlas how can Biden claim to do a better job on COVID when his response is modeled after countries doing worse than we are? He complains about tracing and tracking and also still about testing and his advisors we know they are recommending lockdowns targeted or broader than targeted lockdowns. So how does that make sense? DR. SCOTT ATLAS WHITE HOUSE COVID ADVISER: Well it doesn't Laura. Thanks for having me. I think with a problem here for people who espouse something different than the president is they are now realizing that we now have a consensus forming around the president's policy of protecting seniors and ending the lockdowns opening schools and jobs. We just had a declaration written and the thrust of the declaration is exactly aligned with the president that is opening schools opening society and protecting the high-risk people the seniors. And now we have over 9000 epidemiologists from all over the world signing onto this. We have the World Health Organization signing onto this. We have the recent studies finally coming into the so-called mainstream; even the magazines like ""The Atlantic"" talking about schools should be open.  The new study from Yale that was just spread out talking about how there is very little transmission from children to adults. These are things the president emphasized way back in March not just when he said the cure cannot be worse than the problem. But in his first statements the guide to reopening he said protect the seniors and open the schools open jobs.  This was done in April. And he's been very consistent on that and there is a consensus forming. And the opposition's priority really is well we better lock down we better hide we better have a mask mandate which by the way the mask mandates have been proven not to work. Look at Europe. These places these countries have had mask mandates for months and they are exploding with cases. INGRAHAM: Yes the president was hit repeatedly on the mask issue tonight.  I think it seems like half the questions from Savannah Guthrie were about masks even knowing all of the conflicting information that we saw about masks. And Dr. Atlas speaking of that you did make a cameo in mention at the president's town hall. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SAVANNAH GUTHRIE NBC NEWS HOST: University of Washington which is - they have a model that your coronavirus task force relies on. Says that if everyone wore a mask you could cut expected deaths in half.  TRUMP: And then you have other people that disagree. GUTHRIE: 60000 lives.  TRUMP: Dr. Scott he's from great guy Stanford. He will tell you that he disagrees with you. GUTHRIE: He's not an infectious disease expert. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Your response to that candidate Savannah Guthrie oh sorry the moderator Savannah Guthrie Scott. ATLAS: Yes well there is a lot of things I'm not. I think my children could tell you that. But one thing I can do is read the literature and understand that the evidence on universal masking is really pretty weak. In fact the World Health Organization does not recommend universal masking.  Professor Heneghan who is from Oxford University center for evidence-based medicine says after 20 years of pandemics two decades we're still not sure about universal masking. The CDC study that the president was quoting showed that 70 percent of people who got the virus had worn masks all the time. Over 80 percent almost all the time. So I think it's sort of a lame bizarre obsession at this point to claim that everyone must have universal masking when that really - the cases explode through it we have states we have LA county we have Miami-Dade county we have Hawaii we look all over the world Philippines Spain France UK. Mask mandates don't work. The president has a rational common sense mask policy which is if you cannot socially distance you wear a mask particularly when you are high risk. And I think Americans are getting a little bit sick of this obsession with masks. When you go to the states when you go to Pennsylvania Michigan Wisconsin you have people who are frustrated. They want to get back to their normal lives. They don't want to have a generation of neurotic children wearing masks like the Bubonic plague is everywhere. There is a rational way to use masks. It's simple to understand. That's what the president's policy is. And if that's all they got to run against him I think that is sort of lame. I don't know what to say about that. INGRAHAM: Yes well Dr. Atlas we look at Europe we see what's happening there. The spikes in deaths and hospitalizations and cases and they supposedly were the gold standard and how they handled it. Everyone reviled Trump for saying we should open up. A lot of people are saying that this virus in the non-vulnerable population is almost acting like a vaccination because it's giving some acquired immunity to people who are exposed to it. And people don't want to hear that but that seems to be what's happening right now in the United States lot of people are getting acquired immunity. Dr. Atlas it's great to see you and I'm glad you made that cameo appearance at the debate. That made me happy. All right. You take care. On a related note are lockdowns the sleeper issue of the 2020 election? An intriguing new poll found that of the 14 percent of voters who are not committed to either candidate 24 percent favor locking down again. But 70 percent say it's time to move on and adapt. Joining me now is the man behind that poll Scott Rasmussen pollster and Ballotpedia editor-at-large. Scott I have been saying since about April or maybe early May this is a question between liberty and lockdown. Liberty versus lockdown. Freedom versus lockdown. Is that perhaps coming to the floor now? SCOTT RASMUSSEN EDITOR-AT-LARGE BALLOTPEDIA: I think the attitude you're describing is coming to the floor right now but probably not in that terminology. Americans want to find ways they are frustrated with mask mandates they are frustrated with over-the-top lockdowns. Still want to proceed with the degree of caution and for the most part what people want is to have more authority to make their own decisions. So you might talk about that in freedom terminology. But for most people it's just practical common sense. If I go to a place and I feel uncomfortable well I'm going to may be not go in. If I feel OK I may take my mask off.  They want to have that freedom. And anybody trying to create a nanny-state mindset of telling people what they should do that tends to push these voters away. INGRAHAM: President Trump made the position on lockdowns clear obviously tonight and said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I left North Carolina which I love. I left Pennsylvania. We won a big case in Michigan because that governor has a lockdown where nobody but her husband can do anything. He can go boating and do whatever he wants but nobody else can. The fact is we are winning all these cases because it's unconstitutional what they are doing. And I think they are doing it for political reasons.  But the fact is the cure you can't let this continue to go on with the lockdowns. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Scott does that messaging work especially with suburban moms who are seeing what's happening to their children who are being kept from schools especially in the area where we live D.C. Maryland and Virginia.  It's been very tough. RASMUSSEN: Suburban voters suburban moms are concerned about this. In fact the desire for more lockdowns and stricter controls is pretty much confined to urban areas and Democratic urban voters. Having said that we are talking about issues we are only talking about moving a few voters here and there. You said at the open 14 percent of voters are uncommitted. These might be voters who say they are voting for a libertarian now or who might change their mind on one of the major party candidates. It comes in the context of Joe Biden is ahead narrowly in my state polls and the national polling we are seeing but a shift of a couple of points can move this right back into a toss-up category. And this is an issue that might do it and that most pundits will miss. INGRAHAM: Scott great to see you tonight. Thank you for joining us. We have a lot more reaction to tonight's town hall so stay with us. Plus the revelations surrounding the Bidens well their latest get-rich- quick scheme reveals a very uncomfortable truth. The left gets rich off America's misery. My angle explains in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  INGRAHAM: The Bidens' get-rich-quick scheme that's the focus of tonight's angle. Now if you were shocked this week to learn that the Biden family cashed in on shady overseas deals when Joe Biden was vice president I have one question for you where have you been for the past several years? A treasure trove of emails from foreign interest to Hunter Biden are just more evidence of what we already knew that the family is knee-deep in sleaze. Now people like the Bidens and the Clintons for that matter they don't have to take formal bribes. There is no need for any smoking gun.  They simply do everything possible while in office to help rich people and to fight off movements like ours that would force big business to pay higher wages. Now during the years between 2000 and 2016 a lot of middle-class folks wondered what happened to all our good paying jobs and wages. Wages were really flat. They were flat. Or what happened to all the prosperity we were supposed to see from allowing China into the world trade organization? And if you look at the Bidens' and the Clintons' paydays well you can see where some of that money went. Newly unearthed emails do show that Chinese oil tycoon one of them was paying Joe's son Hunter $10 million a year for introductions alone.  According to one email Hunter said he hashed out an even more lucrative deal with this Chinese oligarch a man named Jianming. Now no surprise Jianming had close ties to the CCP to the Chinese military and Intel agencies. And it was also no surprise that according to ""The New York Times"" that same Chinese billionaire also donated 100000 bucks to the Clinton Foundation. What a coincidence!  But don't bother searching Twitter or other social media sites for any info on the Biden enrichment scheme. It wasn't brought up tonight at the town hall either. Well the Big Tech cover-up is underway. Starting yesterday Twitter accounts that retweeted ""The New York Post"" exclusives were locked by the company. Now this included accounts of the Trump campaign and the White House Press Secretary. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: It's out of control and it's like a third arm. Maybe a first arm of the DNC. Twitter and Facebook they are like - really it's a massive campaign contribution. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: The first arm I love that. But Twitter's non-apology that followed well it was too late because the Biden campaign had the shield it needed to avoid answering or even being asked questions about what Joe knew about Hunter's solicitation scheme and when he knew it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JAMAL BROWN NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY BIDEN CAMPAIGN: I think Twitter's response to the actual article itself makes clear that these purported allegations are false and they are not true. And glad to see social media companies like Twitter taking responsibility to limit misinformation. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: That was on Cheddar. But even if this October surprise ends up hurting Hunter's ability to cash in on aiding our biggest rival well the Bidens have plenty of other ways to cash in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some of these numbers in fundraising really jump off the page record $383 million raised by Joe Biden in September.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They have more than $400 million on hand. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley JPMorgan Bank of America Citigroup it's almost twice as much money going to Biden than it is going to Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Well this is Biden's campaign of course. And he's always been one of the top benefactors of Wall Street's largess. It's been going on for decades. But this year up against the populist incumbent economic nationalist Donald Trump the spigots of Wall Street have really opened up. Billionaires there though they feel very threatened by Trump because he is trying to drain the very swamp that they got so rich filling. Now with all that is at stake for Wall Street the Democrats the mega donor class well they just haven't bought ads with all the money they gave. They've actually bought the media. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BRIANNA KEILAR CNN HOST: The president deploying a racist attack-- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Appeals to racial prejudice and xenophobia. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One group of generals however that the president is standing firm with. Dead racist losers. JON MEACHAM EDITOR NEWSWEEK: Donald Trump makes Richard Nixon look like a family therapist. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's on the ballot is a choice between democracy or some Russian form of dictatorship or autocracy. (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: These people are just completely deranged. Lost all credibility. Why do you think Amazon's Jeff Bezos one of the richest men in the world bought ""The Washington Post""? Just as a hobby? Because he wants to get tough on China do lot of exposes about the Uyghurs. Why do you Steve Jobs' widow bought ""The Atlantic"" magazine which is filled with any Trump hit jobs? Do you think she really cares about your wages making sure they go up the Wall Street? Big business has to pay more money? Of course not. Here's the bottom line. No one and I mean no one in the D.C. establishment actually believes that Trump is a racist or a fascist or Russian mole. They don't think he's going to tear down democracy or blow up the world or destroy the constitution. And they certainly don't think that an old hack like Biden that he is going to save us from COVID or anything else.  Most of them probably don't even think the economy is going to do better for most people under Biden. The establishment just wants Trump and his movement out of the way. So they can go back to doing what they do best making it easy for rich people around the world to take advantage of America's middle class. Also beware of all the help Biden Harris and the donor class are going to get from the biggest manipulators of them all I just mentioned a moment ago the social media giants. It's not just Twitter blocking stories unfavorable to Biden. He's essentially getting in-kind contributions from Facebook Instagram and Google. They're all engaging in censorship so you're kept in the dark and your opinions are going to be kept in the dark as well. It's both insidious and infuriating.  I think we've got to be smarter than they think we are. And we have to leave them politically poor so our hardworking people have a shot at a better freer and safer life.  And that's ""The Angle.""  Joining me now is Mollie Hemingway senior editor at ""The Federalist"" FOX News contributor. Mollie Joe Biden's old pal George Stephanopoulos did not ask a single question tonight about the money scheme and Hunter Biden and what Joe Biden understood and knew about it. Are you surprised?  MOLLIE HEMINGWAY SENIOR EDITOR ""THE FEDERALIST"": I'm not surprised.  George Stephanopoulos is not that dissimilar from his other colleagues. We know that he used to work in a Democratic administration but they all seem to be working currently on behalf of the Democratic Party. And they will do whatever it takes to make sure that they can get their preferred candidate over the finish line and that includes not asking any tough questions.  It's why it's really disappointing that there was no debate tonight because you can't count on anybody in the media to actually ask tough questions of Joe Biden. Maybe the only person in the country who will ask a tough question of Joe Biden is Donald Trump which is why everyone is working so hard to keep him from being in a position where he can do that.  But it's a disservice to the American people. You're absolutely right that we already know that the Biden family has been able to become quite wealthy despite the not wealthy backgrounds that they had because of their proximity to Joe Biden's power and that this is something that matches with so many people in Washington D.C. It is very common for a lot of people to go work for firms that might have interests that are not aligned with our country's.  INGRAHAM: The swamp.  HEMINGWAY: And this issue you look at these bad decisions that have been made for decades. They have been very bad for the country whether it's how we fight wars or how we handle immigration or how we do bailouts or how we engage with China. But they are very very good for elites in Washington D.C. and other places in the United States. And that is why people are so desperate to do whatever it will take to make sure that the people don't get to have a say in how we do these things.  INGRAHAM: I think everyone has to ask a question a really tough question.  What are Joe Biden's mega-donors who are pouring in -- they have $400 million they just announced that they have in their coffers. What are they getting for that money? Why is Michael Bloomberg putting almost $2 million this week into Florida? What is Bloomberg getting? He has huge business interests in China.  I want to get to a moment from the Biden town hall Mollie when Biden was asked to clear up his position on court packing. He did anything but.  Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS ABC NEWS: If they vote on it before the election you are open to expanding the cord?  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm open to considering what happens from that point on. No matter what answer I gave you if I say it that's the headline tomorrow. It won't want to be about what's going on now the improper way they are proceeding.  STEPHANOPOULOS: But don't voters have a right to know where you stand?  BIDEN: They do have a right to know where I stand and they will have a right to know where I stand before they vote.  STEPHANOPOULOS: So you will come out with a clear position before Election Day?  BIDEN: Yes depending on how they handle this.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Depending on how who handles what? Mollie I don't even understand any of that but he obviously is going to pack the court.  Reaction quickly.  HEMINGWAY: All I know is that progressives were thrilled with that response progressives who want to see the court packed. I do think that Republicans need to understand that this is an open thread. It's been issued by quite a few senators the ways he's handling it also suggests that it's a very big threat. If you care about this norm if you care about the courts and if you care about them not being used for political ends I think you have to take this threat very seriously.  INGRAHAM: Yes and Mollie even if state legislators pass great laws you'll have 13 14 15 Supreme Court justices most of them installed by Biden who will just overrule the will of the people state-by-state.  Mollie great to have you on tonight. Good to see you.  And up ahead a tale of two town halls through the lens of the media. We expose what was a flagrant double standard with Trump 2020 senior advisors.  Steve Cortes and Mercedes Schlapp in moments.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Tonight's dueling campaign town halls didn't just differ in content but also in how they were moderated. Case in point these were the types of questions Biden was compelled to answer.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My wife and I are in disbelief the lack of coordinated federal action on COVID-19. We know that your administration would follow the science.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you say to LGBTQ Americans and others who are very worried right now about erosions of their rights and our democracy as a whole?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Vice President my father Drew Lewis served as secretary of transportation under President Ronald Reagan in his first term.  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Oh yes. I'll be darned.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS ABC NEWS: Robert Mueller laid out a lot of evidence of possible obstruction of justice by President Trump. What would a Biden Justice Department do with that evidence?  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And forgetting that this was actually voter town hall this is how NBC's Savannah Guthrie treated the president.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAVANNAH GUTHRIE NBC HOST: In point of fact your administration is about to go to the Supreme Court to argue to throw out the rest of Obamacare which includes the protections for preexisting conditions.  Will you accept a peaceful transfer of power?  There is no law or rule that prohibits you from releasing your tax returns.  That is completely not true.  Disavow QAnon.  You don't know that? OK. DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No I don't that. GUTHRIE: You just this week --  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Joining me now are two Trump 2020 campaign senior advisors Steve Cortes and Mercedes Schlapp. Steve is this really the way the media should work? We didn't play Stephanopoulos much but he was pretty softball in the way he approached Biden. It was a very gentle gentle reframing of some of his answers. Savannah Guthrie was really a competitor to the president not a moderator.  STEVE CORTES NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON AMERICA FIRST: Yes to say the least.  ABC put on the equivalent of a church ice cream social for Joe Biden up in Philadelphia. As a TV programmer it reminded me of Mister Rogers'  Neighborhood. And conversely NBC staged a political knife fight down in Miami. And if I compare that to a TV program it would seem more like ""The Wire.""  So I think what we saw today really unfortunately was a brazen display of media duplicity. It is extremely clear who corporate media wants in this country. And the fact alone and again this isn't my opinion the fact that George Stephanopoulos did not at one moment in the 90 minutes with Joe Biden today mention the biggest story in America right now which is the bombshell revelations from ""The New York Post"" that Joe Biden while he was sitting vice president was fully aware of his son's influence pedaling with shadowy figures all over the world including the two most dangerous adversaries to the United States Russia and China. It's an outrage that he wasn't pressed about that crucial question.  INGRAHAM: It wasn't surprising but it still was stunning.  Mercedes and of course all the times Trump denounced white supremacy in the past wasn't enough for Savannah Guthrie.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAVANNAH GUTHRIE NBC HOST: You were asked point blank to denounce white supremacy. In the moment you didn't.  My question to you is --  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: you've done this to me and everybody --  GUTHRIE: -- why does it seem like --  TRUMP: I denounced white supremacy OK.  GUTHRIE: You did two days later. TRUMP: I denounced white supremacy for years. You didn't ask Joe Biden whether or not he denounces Antifa. I denounce white supremacy. What's your next question?  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Mercedes how many times does he have to answer this? He should denounce media bias too while he denounces white supremacy.  MERCEDES SCHLAPP TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: No kidding. And he denounces fake news all the time.  But can I tell you our president is so amazing. He takes on these incredibly biased moderators if you want to call them that. I would call Savannah a Joe Biden surrogate who literally was reading off the talking points of the DNC. It's completely outrageous how she behaved how hostile she was how she interrupted the president. It was literally like she was the one running for president. Joe Biden should maybe take a page out of Savannah's playbook.  But it clearly shows the continual narrative coming from the fake news media how they will protect Joe Biden at all costs. I thought that they were going to offer Joe Biden some milk and cookies and put him to sleep because it almost put me to sleep when we are watching the ABC town hall.  There was not one tough question coming out of the ABC town hall or George Stephanopoulos. And I just really think it's a disservice for the American people.  INGRAHAM: Steve do you think these help the president? Some people were saying earlier well it doesn't really help him. All the people who watch NBC they already have their minds made up. But does it help him to go into these adversarial settings?  CORTES: I think it does because as Mercedes said he does handle it with such grace he really does particularly when he's talking to regular Americans not so much with the fake news media. He's of course willing to bow up and fight there as he should. And I think it helps him also because again I think this media duplicity is just on full display for the American people. I'll tell you for instance when Donald Trump first started calling the fake news media the enemy of the people I thought that was too harsh and I actually said so a few times on television. You know what I'm wrong and he is completely right because the performance tonight the failure of ABC to even mention one single time this ""New York Post"" bombshell story that reveals just how corrupt our media is and it is unfortunately the enemy of the people.  INGRAHAM: Mercedes back to what I set on ""The Angle"" are you surprised that Wall Street is now fully tipping in favor of Biden given what they have bet on China? Are you surprised by that?  SCHLAPP: No not at all. I think that this is where we are in America. It's Main Street versus Wall Street. And let me tell you something Wall Street should know better than this because it was because of President Trump's economic policies that we have seen a boom in America that we've been able to still stay strong despite the fact that we're facing this global pandemic the fact that we've been able to bring back 11.4 million jobs.  And so I've got to tell you something. The mere fact that the president has been the only one who has stood tough against China brought back jobs brought China back to the negotiating table is just a stark contrast with what we've seen with Joe Biden's coziness with China favoring China in their policies profiting off of China and seeing Hunter Biden and the family also profiting off of China.  INGRAHAM: Big money big money is going to be made in China by Wall Street and who knows extended family tree if heaven forbid he should win. Steve and Mercedes thank you so much. Great to see you.  And it might be the most important Senate race in America. Have you heard what's happening in Michigan? A wrench being thrown into the wheel of Chuck Schumer's dream of taking the gavel. The candidate spearheading this and it's an amazing comeback. John James next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Just a few months ago John James John James the GOP Senate candidate in Michigan he was trailing Democrat incumbent Gary Peters by 10 points. But earlier this week that same poll in ""The New York Times"" showed that James was within striking distance of Peters. He was down by only a point. So what happened? John James joins me now. John I know you ran in 2018 against Stabenow and you came up short. But are the lockdowns and Gretchen Whitmer's approach to COVID contributing to this?  JOHN JAMES (R) MICHIGAN SENATE CANDIDATE: The biggest part is that people in the state of Michigan have excellent B.S. meters. Gary Peters is out there saying he cares about the Great Lakes but there's Asian carp DNA in the Chicago River. They're still dumping in Lake St. Clair. There is PFOS and our kids are still drinking leaded water. Senator Peters what have you done in 30 years?  You're looking at people across the state and our kids are still being forced to go into failing schools and their outcomes determined by their zip code. Senator Peters has been in Washington for 12 years. Was is Gary Peters doing to fix the situation?  You're looking at our health care situation. Senator Peters has been a senator for six years. He is still on an Obamacare exempted gold-plated health care plan. What are you doing to take care of seniors when your voting to support to take $716 billion away from Medicare? Senator Peters has failed Michiganders. They know it. We are telling the truth and right now because of your support and because of what you're doing in this race we are tied because people in the state of Michigan know the truth. They are learning more about me and they know that change is coming and they know that the best is yet to come.  INGRAHAM: The Green New Deal will devastate Michigan. And your opponent was asked about it. and he said this. He said ""We have to push technology as aggressively as we can. We should look at this as an opportunity economically to drive our economy while also doing the right thing for the environment."" So banning fossil fuels raising energy costs how the heck is that going to help manufacturing in Michigan John?  JAMES: Winter is coming. Winter is coming and it's going to be a lot colder up here in Michigan that it is down in the swamp. Senator Peters wouldn't understand but we need to make sure that we have sustainable energy solutions yes but energy solutions that are also accessible and economic for all Michiganders not just the elites who can pay for it.  We need to also make sure that we are holding China accountable for their pollution and their contribution to climate change. And we also need to make sure that we are not leaving our number one industry and pushing more jobs out of the state. Senator Peters supports regulations and litigation that has pushed our jobs overseas. Businesses don't send our jobs to China and Mexico. Bureaucrats and politicians like Gary Peters send our jobs to China and Mexico.  Senator Peters was supposed to be on a commission to hold China accountable. Do you think he showed up? No. He barely showed up for any of those meetings and now he wants to show up in 2020 in an election year talking about earning our vote. It's too late. You can't show up in an election year be 33 percent unknown your states and then tell lies all the way through and people still don't know what you've done. The Green New Deal would devastate our state.  INGRAHAM: John we've got to go.  JAMES: And me being an automotive supplier I know understand what it takes to lead.  INGRAHAM: We've got to go but point made.  JAMES: Go to John James for Senate and please support. Thanks. INGRAHAM: And he has a lot to answer for. Up ahead the most impactful moment from Amy Coney Barrett's character hearing today. The Last Bite. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: When Amy Coney Barrett's former law student Laura Wolk spoke today it was amazing. She's blind. She couldn't get the technology she needed when she worked and she was a student at the university and Judge Barrett she just went above and beyond for her.

317,Trump adviser calls NBC town hall 'brazen display of media duplicity'," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday confirmed that she has not spoken to President Trump for more than a year -- but said working with intermediaries has brought results and talks don't have to be ""person-to-person."" Pelosi was asked by MSNBC host Nicole Wallace if a year after she walked out of a contentious Oct. 16 meeting at the White House and stopped speaking with Trump if she would be open if Trump ever reached out to “open that channel of conversation.”  TRUMP SAYS IF HE AND PELOSI AGREE ON STIMULUS PACKAGE SENATE GOP WILL GET ON BOARD ""Well it would depend on what the purpose is"" Pelosi said. She then suggested that she had in fact been more productive negotiating with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and others in the White House. “Let me say without the two of us speaking person-to-person but either through the airwaves or through the President's intermediaries we were able in that period of time to pass a huge omnibus bill to keep government open working with Secretary Mnuchin then” she said. She pointed to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade deal which passed Congress as well as four bipartisan bills related to the COVID-19 crisis as examples of cooperation with the White House. “So it isn't as if it has to be person-to-person between the Speaker and the President” she said. “It has to be knowledge for knowledge in terms of what we – what our purpose is what we know about the challenge we face and what the possible solutions are.” ""The last thing it is about is whether the President speaks truth in any meeting in the White House worthy of attending"" she said. Trump said Thursday that he is “ready to sign” a fourth coronavirus stimulus package and if he and Pelosi strike a deal Senate Republicans will get on board. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP During a town hall hosted by NBC News Thursday night the president said he and his administration “are ready to sign.” “You know who I am negotiating against? Nancy Pelosi. She doesn’t want to give the money” he said. “This is not our people’s fault. This is China’s fault.” Fox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.

318,Pelosi after a year of not speaking to Trump says talks don't have to be 'person-to-person'," Law enforcement groups blasted Vice President Joe Biden for again suggesting training police to shoot suspects ""in the leg"" is a viable way to avoid fatalities decrying the proposal as dangerous and ignorant. During an ABC News town hall Thursday Biden gave the shooting advice while talking about broader police reforms which have been on the public conscience since the killing of George Floyd sparked nationwide racial unrest.  ""There's a lot of things we've learned and it takes time but we can do this"" Biden said. ""You can ban chokeholds ... you have to teach people how to de-escalate circumstances. ... Instead of anybody coming at you and the first thing you do is shoot to kill you shoot them in the leg."" Police officers and law enforcement groups pounced on the suggestion that officers would train to shoot someone in the leg rather than ""center mass"" the largest part of the body that has long been the firearms training target. John Evans president of the Buffalo Police Benevolent Association told Fox News that Biden's suggestion is ""absolutely ridiculous"" and ""incredibly ignorant."" ""The guy's clueless"" Evans said. ""And I know he's just trying to appease his left-wing base but it's a really foolish statement."" POLICE GROUPS CRITICIZE BIDEN SUGGESTION THAT COPS BE TRAINED TO SHOOT KNIFE-WIELDING ATTACKERS ‘IN THE LEG’ Joe Gamaldi vice president of the national Fraternal Order of Police dismissed Biden's suggestion as ""completely ridiculous ""unrealistic"" and a ""pandering talking point."" ""Shootings are dynamic situations and we shoot to stop the threat"" Gamaldi told Fox News. ""It's incredibly difficult to hit a moving target."" The Fraternal Order of Police has endorsed President Trump. Police are trained to aim at center mass because it's the largest target whereas aiming at a leg would be much more difficult because it's smaller and a moving target. ""By aiming at legs we are much more likely to miss and we already only hit roughly 50% of the time"" Gamaldi said. 'FED UP' POLICE RALLY BEHIND THEIR OWN IN FACE OF POST-GEORGE FLOYD SCRUTINY Gamaldi recalled a shooting he was involved in about 14 years ago. ""Between being terrified I was going to die someone shooting at me and then I need to aim at their legs -- it’s not realistic."" The law enforcement officials interviewed by Fox News also say it's a fallacy that shooting someone in the leg could be less lethal especially if a bullet hits the large femoral artery in the thigh.  But officers fear the consequences if they miss the leg completely and the bullet goes astray. Or if their leg shot doesn't slow down the suspect he has a chance to harm the officer or a citizen. ""If an individual is coming at you with a knife and you shoot for the leg and you miss he's on you"" said Evans a Trump supporter.  Thursday's town hall wasn't the first time Biden made the leg suggestion. In June Biden said that -- if facing a threat from a person with ""a knife or something"" -- police should be trained to “shoot ‘em in the leg instead of the heart."" “Instead of standing there and teaching a cop when there’s an unarmed person coming at ‘em with a knife or something shoot ‘em in the leg instead of in the heart” Biden said at a June 1 address to Black community leaders in Wilmington Del. “There are a lot of things that can change” Biden said regarding police training. Police officers called out Biden at the time for the unrealistic suggestion so they are unsure why he is still campaigning on it just days before the election.  ""I don't know why he repeated it after I'm sure it was pointed out to him that it's a ridiculous procedure to pursue"" Evans said.  Dana Schrad executive director of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police said Biden isn't the first person to peddle the leg myth.   ""That myth has been around for a long time. And a lot of Democrats and Republicans have fallen for it"" Schrad said. ""To be honest with you Joe Biden has actually been fairly supportive of law enforcement and he's done a lot over the years in different areas supportive of law enforcement. So it's unfortunate that he would not know that that's not a [viable] training tactic in law enforcement."" BIDEN CAMPAIGN WARNS AGAINST COMPLACENCY IN MEMO: 'DONALD TRUMP CAN STILL WIN THIS' The Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police does not endorse candidates in the presidential race. Officers are rarely in a situation where they have to use their firearms and as a result they aren't sharpshooters Schrad said. It would be very hard to get an accurate shot on a smaller moving part and the risk for missing is too great.    Officers have other options for less lethal forms of force such as tasers rubber bullets pepper spray and tear gas. When they have to use their firearm it's in a rare dire circumstance to protect their life or the life of another she said.  ""Police officers use firearms as a last resort"" Schrad said.  Fox News' Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.  ", https://www.foxnews.com/politics/police-rip-bidens-advice-to-shoot-suspects-in-the-leg,0.8103357300023539

David Perdue R-Ga. appeared to mock the name of democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris at a rally Friday.  ""Kamala? Or Kamala? Kamal-mala-mala. I don't know. Whatever"" Perdue repeated as he changed the intonation of her name at President Trump's rally in Macon Ga. KELLY RAISES $39 MILLION MCSALLY RAISES $23 MILLION IN ARIZONA SENATE RACE Perdue's campaign brushed off the mispronunciation as an accident.  ""Senator Perdue simply mispronounced Senator Harris' name and he didn't mean anything by it"" John Burke the communications director for Perdue's campaign tweeted Friday night. ""He was making an argument against the radical socialist agenda that she and her endorsed candidate Jon Ossoff are pushing."" Ossoff's campaign didn't buy it though and demanded that Perdue apologize.  FEC RECORDS SHOW CUNNINGHAM'S ALLEGED MISTRESS DONATED TO HIS CAMPAIGN “Georgia needs a leader who will unite us to defeat COVID-19 not a pathetic schoolyard bully who engages in a stunning and juvenile display of bigotry at a Trump rally” Ossoff said Saturday. “David Perdue should grow up take responsibility for once in his career admit he was wrong and publicly apologize.” Perdue who has served in the Senate since 2016 is currently neck-and-neck with Ossoff in the polls. According to the RealClearPolitics poll average Perdue is ahead 46% to 45%.  The $1 million that Ossoff raised in less than 24 hours will go into a sizable war chest he has built. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Thursday that Ossoff brought in $21.3 million over the last three months and ended the third quarter with $8.3 million in cash on hand.  CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile Perdue raised $5.6 million over the same period though he came into the race with a large war chest and currently has $8.2 million on hand AJC reports.  If both Ossoff and Perdue fail to capture at least 50% of votes in the election next month then the race will be decided by a runoff in January.  ", https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ossoff-raises,0.8102435443830089
320,Ossoff raises $1 million in Senate race after Perdue mispronounces Kamala Harris's name," Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Saturday detailed a $500 billion “skinny” coronavirus relief bill that he said the Senate will vote on this Wednesday.  The bill far more targeted than the White House’s $1.8 trillion relief measure will expand federal unemployment benefits replenish the Paycheck Protection Program provide over $100 billion to schools and fund vaccine production and distribution as well as testing and tracing.  McConnell said that barring any obstruction from Democrats the Senate would vote on the measure before turning to vote on Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.  He’d need 60 votes to move the bill through the Senate. Democrats previously blocked a similar bill. BIDEN SENATE GOP UNHAPPY WITH WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS OFFER: 'ONE STEP FORWARD TWO STEPS BACK' The White House offered $1.8 trillion for coronavirus relief the closest an offer has been to the House’s trimmed $2.2 trillion bill but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected it. “Working families have spent months waiting for Speaker Pelosi’s Marie Antoinette act to stop” the Kentucky Republican said in a statement. President Trump called for an even higher number but McConnell brushed off the president’s demands to try to instead push for a smaller more immediate bill. Negotiations remain ongoing between the White House and Pelosi who is set to again speak to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin Saturday night.  “Republicans have tried numerous times to secure bipartisan agreement” McConnell continued. “But Speaker Pelosi keeps saying she feels ‘nothing’ is better than ‘something’ and clinging to far-left demands that are designed to kill any hope of a deal.” McConnell said the bill was not designed to be a cure-all for pandemic relief. “It would deliver huge amounts of additional help to workers and families right now while Washington keeps arguing over the rest.”  Senate Republicans unveiled a $1.1 trillion relief package in July but McConnell warned that up to 20 GOP senators could oppose it if it came for a vote.  TRUMP PREPARING NEW $1.8T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE URGES CONGRESS TO 'GO BIG'  A $500B bill in September was supported by 52 of 53 Republicans before it was blocked by Democrats.  Meanwhile Trump and Pelosi have not personally spoken in over a year. When asked if he would call up Pelosi to work through negotiations on relief Trump said he wouldn’t because the Speaker has “a lot of mental problems.  Pelosi also defended her decision to avoid the president saying of speaking with him: ""I don't find it a good use of time."" “Well I've spoken to his representatives and he says that they speak for him. And I take that to be true about the secretary of the Treasury and we have worked together"" Pelosi said noting previous coronavirus deals.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Quite frankly my experience with the president has been that it hasn't been on the level.

321,McConnell sets Wednesday vote for $500B COVID relief bill, Anyone who cares about establishing an orderly immigration system and ending the flow of illegal drugs violent criminals and human traffickers coming across our southern border should take heart from the undeniable fact that President Trump’s administration is winning the fight for border security.  After years of growth net migration into the United States was already dramatically decreasing before the coronavirus pandemic. For the first time since the 1960s the percentage of the U.S. population made up of people born in other nations is shrinking. This is proof of a profound change in the dynamics of migration in a direction most Americans have long supported and it represents the culmination of longstanding efforts to address both illegal immigration and the unintended abuse of our lawful immigration system. FILMMAKER’S LOYALTIES SHAKEN AFTER MAKING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTARY: ‘THE TRUTH IS EYE-OPENING' The refugee system — set up to provide refuge for victims of war and persecution who had nowhere else to go often on an explicitly temporary basis — had long since become a racket. It provided prestigious jobs in Washington for “resettlement experts” and taxpayer money for glorified slumlords while generating massive fallout for unsuspecting American communities. Today the system has finally been returned to its proper role. The 18000-migrant cap is the lowest since the U.S. Refugee Act of 1980 dramatically raised quotas and ushered in a decades-long era of widespread abuse. As a result the data shows that our refugee slots are finally being used for their intended purpose of helping genuinely oppressed people and groups while excluding “refugees” from areas rife with terrorist groups. The asylum system too has been reined in and no longer serves as a backdoor visa program. Under the “Remain in Mexico” policy initiated by President Trump and related cooperative agreements with Mexico and other countries to the south claiming a “credible fear” of oppression in one’s home country is no longer a free ticket into the United States. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The Justice Department has finally halted the rapid expansion of hardships that qualified someone as an “asylum seeker” which allowed economic migrants to avoid scrutiny of their claims for months or years. Even these significant asylum reforms are merely one part of a wider series of President Trump’s policy successes that helped defeat the so-called caravan waves of 2018 and 2019 and made the border safer and more secure than at any point in recent memory.  Perhaps most importantly we have made real progress on the border wall. More physical barriers go up every day making our Border Patrol agents’ jobs easier and protecting our border communities.

322,Brandon Judd: Trump is strengthening border security keeping violent criminals and illegal drugs out of US, Women’s rallies against President Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett swept through cities including Los Angeles Washington and New York on Saturday despite ongoing bans of some large gatherings in many. In New York the marches came shortly after Gov. Andrew Cuomo shut down schools and businesses and banned mass gatherings in seven zip codes of Queens and Brooklyn. The lockdowns mostly affected Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods prompting many in the community to protest their synagogues being closed during holidays.  Cuomo’s office could not be reached for comment to see if they had approved the gatherings despite the lockdown. It was unclear whether demonstrators marched through the COVID-19 “cluster” neighborhoods.  In New York protesters prominently gathered in Washington Square Park in Manhattan chanting slogans like “Vote him out.” Late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was widely commemorated at the marches with signs such as one that read “Vote and tell ‘em Ruth sent you!”  Meanwhile Cuomo foiled plans for a 10000 person wedding in Williamsburg scheduled for Monday. On Friday the New York Sheriff’s Office ordered the cancelation of the event.  AMY CONEY BARRETT: THE LIKELY CONFIRMATION SCHEDULE FOR THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE  “Look you can get married.

'You get the same result at the end of the day.” In Los Angeles protesters dressed up as characters from The Handmaid’s Tale-- a book of a  dystopian future some liberal activists assure will become reality if Barrett is confirmed to the court.  One held a sign reading “The system cannot be reformed-- it must be thrown out!” Another sign read: “You can be an anti-choice feminist. Just like you can be a Jewish Nazi.”  Meanwhile thousands stormed the streets of Washington D.C. in protest. NPR reported the Washington march was permitted to have up to 10000 attendees. At one point they came face to face with anti-abortion demonstrators chanting “my body my choice” as the pro-life demonstrators held photos of newborns.  At another point a pro-Barrett group was gathered listening to a speech and protesters chanted “RBG” to drown out the speaker.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP , https://www.foxnews.com/politics/womens-marches-ny-dc-la-trump-judge-amy-coney-barrett,0.810342105207667

324,Free speech rally marred by violence as counterprotesters storm event beat pro-Trump demonstrators," AUCKLAND New Zealand — New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern won a second term in office Saturday in an election landslide of historic proportions. With most votes counted Ardern's liberal Labour Party was winning 49% of the vote compared to 27% for its main challenger the conservative National Party. Labour was on target to win an outright majority of the seats in Parliament something that hasn’t happened since New Zealand implemented a proportional voting system 24 years ago. Typically parties must form alliances to govern but this time Ardern and Labour can go it alone. In a victory speech in front of hundreds of cheering supporters in Auckland Ardern said her party had gotten more support from New Zealanders that at any time in at least 50 years. “This has not been an ordinary election and it's not an ordinary time” she said. “It's been full of uncertainty and anxiety and we set out to be an antidote to that."" NEW ZEALAND PASSPORT RANKED AS MOST POWERFUL IN UPDATED REPORT Ardern promised not to take her new supporters for granted and to govern for all New Zealanders. “We are living in an increasingly polarized world a place where more and more people have lost the ability to see one another's point of view” she said. “I think in this election New Zealanders have shown that this is not who we are.” A record number of voters cast early ballots in the two weeks leading up to the election. On the campaign trail Ardern was greeted like a rock star by people who crammed into malls and spilled onto streets to cheer her on and get selfies with her. Her popularity soared earlier this year after she led a successful effort to stamp out the coronavirus. There is currently no community spread of the virus in the nation of 5 million and people are no longer required to wear masks or social distance. Ardern 40 won the top job after the 2017 election when Labour formed an alliance with two other parties. The following year she became only the second world leader to give birth while in office. She became a role model for working mothers around the world many of whom saw her as a counterpoint to President Donald Trump. And she was praised for her handling of last year’s attack on two Christchurch mosques when a white supremacist gunned down 51 Muslim worshippers. She moved quickly to pass new laws banning the deadliest types of semi-automatic weapons. In late March this year when only about 100 people had tested positive for COVID-19 Ardern and her health officials put New Zealand into a strict lockdown with a motto of “Go hard and go early.” She shut the borders and outlined an ambitious goal of eliminating the virus entirely rather than just trying to control its spread. With New Zealand having the advantage of being an isolated island nation the strategy worked. The country eliminated community transmission for 102 days before a new cluster was discovered in August in Auckland. Ardern swiftly imposed a second lockdown in Auckland and the new outbreak faded away. The only new cases found recently have been among returning travelers who are in quarantine. The Auckland outbreak also prompted Ardern to postpone the election by a month and helped increase the early voter turnout. The National Party’s leader Judith Collins is a former lawyer. She served as a minister when National was in power and prides herself on a blunt no-nonsense approach a contrast to Ardern’s empathetic style. Collins 61 was promising sweeping tax cuts in response to the economic downturn caused by the virus. In a speech to her supporters in Auckland Collins said she'd called Ardern to congratulate her. “It is an outstanding result for the Labour Party” Collins said. “It has been a tough campaign."" Collins promised that the party would be back to fight another day. The election also saw Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters and his small New Zealand First party voted out. The libertarian ACT Party increased its support to 8% and the Green Party won 7.5% of the votes. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Labour Minister David Parker said it was a landslide win for his party. “It’s a tremendous accolade first and foremost to the prime minister but also to the wider Labour team and the Labour movement” he said. In the election voters also had a say on two contentious social issues — whether to legalize marijuana and euthanasia. Polls taken before the election indicated the euthanasia referendum was likely to pass while the outcome of the marijuana vote remained uncertain.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Tyler led the Black Knights with 19 carries and had 95 yards rushing. Tyler's 37-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter stretched the lead to 21-10. Buchanan had 10 carries for 40 yards and a 5-yard score. Ballard carried the ball three times and had his first career touchdown run a 5-yarder in the fourth. Sincere McCormick had 133 yards rushing for UTSA (3-3). Hunter Duplessis stretched his nation-leading field-goal streak to 21 with a career-best 50-yarder but had extra-point attempt blocked. Frank Harris threw his first pass of the game an 11-yard TD to Zakhari Franklin in the corner of the end zone to pull the Roadrunners to 21-16.

326,Adkins runs for 101 yards and a TD Army beats UTSA 28-16," Virgil van Dijk has been a commanding — even transcendent — presence at the heart of Liverpool’s defense throughout the team’s rise to the top of English and European soccer in recent years. In a major concern for the Premier League champions they might have to learn how to cope without their warrior at the back for quite some time. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Early in what proved to be a painful Merseyside derby for Liverpool Van Dijk was the subject of a reckless lunge by Jordan Pickford that saw the Everton goalkeeper clatter into the extended right leg of the Netherlands defender. Van Dijk roared in agony and tellingly stayed down. And that was when Jürgen Klopp knew it was serious. “Virgil played I don’t know how many games in a row he plays with pain but he couldn’t play on and that’s not good” Klopp said after the 2-2 draw at Goodison Park. Indeed Van Dijk — English soccer’s player of the year from 2018-19 who had played every minute of Liverpool’s previous 74 league games dating back to September 2018 — immediately came off after lengthy treatment and hobbled gingerly around the field to the locker room. There was no official word from Liverpool on the potential length of his absence but Van Dijk reportedly left hospital on crutches in the evening. Broadcaster beIN Sports said it has received information that the player has damaged his anterior cruciate ligament. With the draw Liverpool extended its 10-year unbeaten record against its neighbor but Klopp was a frustrated man as he made the short trip home from Goodison. Aside from the fact Pickford escaped punishment for the challenge on Van Dijk — the VAR seemingly didn’t review the incident which came after an offside was called — Klopp was unhappy his team had what would have been a winning goal from Jordan Henderson disallowed in the second minute of stoppage time. The VAR did intervene this time spotting Sadio Mane was offside by the narrowest of margins. Mane had given Liverpool a third-minute lead only for Michael Keane to equalize with a towering header at a corner. Mohamed Salah reclaimed the lead for the champions with his sixth goal of the campaign but Dominic Calvert-Lewin grabbed Everton’s second equalizer by rising high to power home a left-wing cross for his 10th goal in seven club matches in all competitions. Van Dijk might have been marking Keane and Calvert-Lewin for both of those Everton chances. It is potentially a sign of things to come for Liverpool. Everton dropped points for the first time this season in its fifth match but stayed top three points above Liverpool. AGUERO’S ACTION Sergio Aguero didn’t score on his return to the Manchester City lineup for the first time in nearly four months. He was at the center of a potentially contentious incident though in City’s 1-0 win over Arsenal. In the 42nd minute Aguero was seen complaining about a decision to female assistant referee Sian Massey-Ellis. As Massey-Ellis moved along the touchline Aguero walked next to her and placed his arm around her neck in an action that would be in breach of coronavirus guidelines. The Argentina international was not sanctioned. “Sergio is the nicest person I ever met in my life” City manager Pep Guardiola said. ""Look for problems in other situations not in this one.” Raheem Sterling scored City’s winner in the 23rd minute of a hard-fought game at Etihad Stadium as the hosts coped without injured Kevin De Bruyne. City is in midtable and three points behind title rival Liverpool but has a game in hand. REDEMPTION FOR MAGUIRE FERNANDES Finally something to celebrate for Harry Maguire after a tough few months for the Manchester United captain. There was redemption too for Bruno Fernandes in United's 4-1 win at Newcastle. Maguire scored a fine header for United's equalizer days after getting sent off playing for England. He has produced some suspect defending for United this season into which he came on the back of being arrested after a late-night incident on the Greek island of Mykonos. As for Fernandes he had a penalty saved when the score was 1-1 but made amends by scoring a brilliant goal into the top corner after a counterattack in the 86th. Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Marcus Rashford added even later goals. CHELSEA EXPOSED Chelsea’s defensive vulnerability was exposed in a 3-3 home draw with Southampton which equalized in the second minute of stoppage time through Jannik Vestergaard after having already rallied from 2-0 down. Timo Werner scored Chelsea’s first two goals and played in Kai Havertz to make it 3-2 but the hosts were undone by dreadful defending and goalkeeping. For Southampton’s second goal Kurt Zouma underhit a back pass before goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga made two errors in a matter of seconds to allow Che Adams to score. Kepa was filling in for the injured Edouard Mendy while another new signing — center back Thiago Silva — was also missing. While Chelsea’s attack is starting to purr as key forwards return from injury the defense looks to be the team’s biggest barrier to a concerted title challenge.

327,Van Dijk injury causes concern for frustrated Liverpool, The New England Patriots went back to work Saturday in preparation for their twice-postponed game against Denver even as they added three more players to the COVID-19 injury list. Offensive lineman Shaquille Mason and defensive lineman Derek Rivers were added to the list on Saturday as was running back Sony Michel who was already on injured reserve with a leg injury. The moves come a day after center James Ferentz was added to the COVID-19 list prompting the team to cancel practice Friday and close its facility. A Patriots spokesman said Saturday the team was proceeding with its usual day-before walkthrough but all meetings would be virtual. The game against the Broncos was originally scheduled for Oct. 11 then pushed back one day and then rescheduled for Sunday at 1 p.m. after a fourth Patriot tested positive for the coronavirus. CLICK HERE FOR MORE NFL COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The Broncos had COVID-19 news of their own Saturday: Running backs coach Curtis Modkins has tested positive and won’t make the trip to New England. He is in isolation and has no symptoms. Elsewhere the Jacksonville Jaguars said that a practice-squad player tested positive. The team placed 12 players on the practice squad COVID-19 list 11 of them because they have been in close proximity with the infected teammate. It benefited Jacksonville that it separates practice-squad players from those on the 53-man roster creating an extra level of protection to help prevent an outbreak. The Jaguars also placed defensive end Josh Mauro on the regular COVID-19 list. He had been suspended the first five weeks of the regular season but rejoined the team Monday and spent the week with the practice squad. Those on the list will need three negative tests to be removed. The Jaguars (1-4) are confident they will host Detroit (1-3) on Sunday as scheduled even though they held football activities remotely Saturday as part of NFL safety protocols. Also dealing with COVID issues in recent days: Atlanta Indianapolis Carolina and Baltimore. The Colts had four positive tests that came up negative upon retesting. The Falcons returned to their facility one day after abandoning it because of a second positive. New England already had the Week 5 matchup against Denver postponed following four earlier positive coronavirus tests by players including quarterback Cam Newton and cornerback Stephon Gilmore. Gilmore the reigning Defensive Player of the Year and Newton returned to practice this week for the first time since testing positive. Newton missed New England’s loss at Kansas City on Oct. 5 after his Oct. 2 positive test. He was activated from the reserve/COVID-19 list on Wednesday. Gilmore who tested positive Oct. 7 was activated from the list Thursday. Practice-squad player Bill Murray also returned from the COVID-19 list Thursday. Defensive tackle Byron Cowart who tested positive Oct. 11 was joined on the list by Ferentz. The Broncos haven’t played since Oct. 1. If they play Sunday they’ll have had 16 days between games one day longer than Tennessee’s layoff before the Titans beat Buffalo on Tuesday night following the NFL’s first COVID-19 outbreak which affected two dozen members of the organization. Denver’s layoff is the longest in the league since 2001 when the NFL postponed all games on the weekend following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Three teams — the Saints Steelers and Buccaneers — had byes when play resumed a week later so they all had 20 days between games that year. Of those three only the Steelers won in their return to action. Indianapolis closed its practice facility then the four retests came back negative and the building reopened. Browns star receiver Odell Beckham Jr. who was ill and sent home Thursday and not allowed to practice Friday had his second negative test in 24 hours. That cleared him to play Sunday at Pittsburgh. The Ravens placed defensive tackle Brandon Williams — a key figure in Baltimore’s run defense — on the reserve/COVID-19 list. The team isn’t saying if he tested positive or came in close contact with someone infected. The Falcons left as scheduled in two planes for Sunday’s game at Minnesota. The team said defensive end John Cominsky was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list and defensive line coaches Tosh Lupoi and Jess Simpson did not make the trip. The Falcons have moved Edmond Robinson and defensive tackle Chris Slayton from the practice squad to the active roster as COVID-19 replacements. Earlier this week the team placed rookie defensive tackle Marlon Davidson on the reserve/COVID-19 list. The Falcons had to shut their facility Thursday but reopened Friday after one nonplayer tested positive. The Panthers placed guard/center Tyler Larsen on the reserve/COVID-19 list five days after he played against Atlanta. , https://www.foxnews.com/sports/patriots-place-3-more-on-covid-ir-but-broncos-game-still-on,0.8103011503252114
328,Patriots place 3 more on COVID-IR but Broncos game still on, The tweets are running the asylum. Twitter’s senior executives have a long history of anti-Trump hatred a Post review of dozens of accounts of top employees found. The venom vitriol and in some cases vows to help Joe Biden across the finish line in next month’s presidential election continue to live online as the company earlier this week decided to censor The New York Post’s revelations about Hunter Biden’s emails to a consultant for the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. “GET HIM OUT” posted a senior site reliability engineer on Aug. 18. “What a f–king baboon.” One manager with almost nine years on the job said he was quite keen to watch Biden “crush [President Trump] in the election” and that he hoped the president would “be utterly humiliated while also suffering greatly from #COVID19.” In another post he fantasized about the president being put on a ventilator. He calls Trump “a f–king idiot” and the voters who elected him — “hysterically f–king stupid people.” At the same time the employee has been a consistent cheerleader of his company’s efforts to rein in the president on the platform and curb the spread of “misinformation.” BIG TECH CEOS CALLED TO TESTIFY WEDNESDAY BEFORE SENATE AMID CENSORSHIP UPROAR “I’m really proud of how quickly we’ve worked to make this possible for the US elections” he wrote. Others publicly wish the president harm. One Twitter engineering manager said Trump should “die in a fire” in a January 2017 tweet. A year later he rang in the new year by saying “Happy 2018! Donald Trump is dead!” None of these comments have ever been flagged by Twitter or been subject to any other form of official sanction even as the social-media giant dishes out discipline to others for sharing legitimate news stories that might hurt Biden. The company finally ordered the vicious tweet to be deleted on May 29 — years after being posted. A consistent theme among employees is a desire to see Trump defeated. A talent brand program manager cried after Trump was elected president and publicly vowed to oppose him. A global project manager with more than a decade on the job posted proudly that he was phone banking for Biden. A vice president in sales finance said supporting Biden alone was not enough and urged colleagues to spread cash to Dems in competitive Senate races. After a fly landed on Vice President Mike Pence’s head during his debate with Sen. Kamala Harris on Oct. 7 the Twitter veep noted crudely that flies are “drawn to sh-t.” FACT-CHECKING GURUBLASTS TWITTER FACEBOOK AS DANGEROUS 'ARBITERS OF THE TRUTH' AFTER CENSORING BIDEN ARTICLE One woman has worked at Twitter since 2012 with her only career interruption being a four-month stint as a data analyst for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. She boasted how her husband twice sued the Trump administration. “Trump must be defeated” opined another exec a group product manager. One employee took to Twitter last month to inform the world that her pup was part of the resistance as well. “Every night my dog takes a crap on the lawn of the one house on our street with a Trump sign” she said proudly. Ad hominem jabs toward Trump and his administration were commonplace among Twitter’s longtime ranks. The company’s global creative partnership head has called Trump “swine.” An associate brand strategist labeled the president an “egomaniacal blowhard.” A sales manager in New York called Trump “the Enron of presidents.” Conservative critics — who have long complained of Twitter’s systemic bias against Republicans — were not surprised. “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out why they only selectively enforce these rules. It’s because the people who work there all believe the same things” GOP strategist Chris Barron told The Post. “A liberal [verified account] never has to pay a price for advocating violence.” “We do not hire based on political beliefs and completely support our employees’ right to express themselves and support the causes they care about” Twitter’s Chief Human Resources Officer Jennifer Christie said in a statement to The Post. “Our employees are professionals and we require them to bring objectivity to their work regardless of their personal views. We will not be dissuaded from continuing to work to fairly and impartially enforce our rules.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Spreading lies about the Trump family is also not beneath Twitter’s sentinels. A senior staff engineer inquired why the media wasn’t looking into Melania Trump’s “possible stint as a sex worker.” (The first lady denied this allegation and successfully sued over it.) Twitter’s “head of integrity” Yoel Roth was infamously busted over a series of old tweets revealing him to be a die-hard Trump hater. In his posts Roth — who helped author the policy update used by the company to flag and label posts from President Trump — compared White House officials to Nazis and Trump to a “racist tangerine.” , https://www.foxnews.com/politics/twitter-employees-openly-rip-trump-praise-biden-trump-must-be-defeated,0.8102883799096041
329,Twitter employees openly rip Trump praise Biden: 'Trump must be defeated'," Corey Seager's sweet swing. Walker Buehler's calm. Kenley Jansen's resurgence. The Los Angeles Dodgers got what they needed — again. “We did what we had to do to force a Game 7"" Justin Turner said. They sure did. Seager homered again Buehler pitched six scoreless innings and the Dodgers beat the Atlanta Braves 3-1 on Saturday to send the NL Championship Series to a winner-take-all finale. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Los Angeles avoided elimination for the second time in less than 24 hours staying alive in its pursuit of a third pennant in four years. It hasn't won a championship since 1988. “I’m still sort of recovering from this one but already thinking about Game 7” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “That’s what you live for.” Turner also homered for Los Angeles and Jansen threw a six-pitch ninth for his 18th career postseason save. The NL West and East champions play again Sunday night with the potential for two rookie starters in a Game 7 for the first time in big league history. Roberts was keeping his options open for his starting pitcher while the Braves plan to go with rookie right-hander Ian Anderson who has thrown 15 2/3 scoreless innings in his three postseason starts. Tony Gonsolin and three-time NL Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw are among the possibilities for Los Angeles. “Shoot we’ll go out there and let ’er fly. A Game 7 is another baseball game” Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said. “You have to treat it as such.” The Braves were hoping to celebrate Snitker’s 65th birthday Saturday with the franchise’s first World Series berth since 1999. But Max Fried took his first loss all year working into the seventh inning after surrendering three runs during a rocky first. Buehler using Stan's Rodeo Ointment to deal with bothersome blisters threw 65 of his 89 pitches for strikes. He allowed seven hits while striking out six without a walk. After Atlanta loaded the bases with three singles in a row to start the top of second — the last hit by his Vanderbilt roommate Dansby Swanson — the right-hander really brought the heat with 10 consecutive fastballs to get out of the jam. Austin Riley struck out on a 98.7 mph pitch before Nick Markakis took a called third strike on 99.7 mph. Cristian Pache the 21-year-old rookie who had an RBI in each of his first four NLCS starts was retired on an inning-ending groundout. “His mound presence is just unbelievable"" Turner said. Buehler said he has never felt that calm in a game especially a situation like that. He credited catcher Austin Barnes — and past experiences. “I’ve failed in those moments. I've been through it and I’ve been good after it but that failure doesn’t really scare me anymore” Buehler said. “The more times you go through things like that your heartbeat kind of changes and can slow down."" It was a much different result than Buehler’s postseason debut two years ago in Game 3 of the NL Division Series when the Braves also loaded the bases against him in the second inning. After a walk drove in a run Ronald Acuña Jr. hit a grand slam on the next pitch. Fried who struck out five and walked four in 6 2/3 innings allowed only two homers in his 11 starts while going 7-0 during the regular season. But the Dodgers went deep twice in three pitches in the first. Seager pulled a towering shot to right on a 73-mph curveball and Turner connected on a 93-mph sinker that went 418 feet to straightaway center. Max Muncy walked and scored after back-to-back singles by Will Smith and Cody Bellinger that made it 3-0. “I came out in a game like this and kind of put us behind the eight-ball real quick.” Fried said. “To me that’s unacceptable.” Seager who homered twice in Game 5 on Friday night has NLCS records with five homers and 11 RBIs and still a game to play. His six homers overall are already a Dodgers postseason record. Mookie Betts the 2018 AL MVP and first-year Dodger made a l eaping catch against the right field wall to end the fifth. While it wouldn’t have been a homer it robbed Marcell Ozuna of extra bases and the Braves a likely run. Betts let out a emphatic shout while pumping both fists then celebrated with Bellinger while Buehler held his right arm high in the air. With Buehler out of the game Nick Markakis greeted Blake Treinen with triple to right leading off off the seventh and came home on a one-out double by Ronald Acuña Jr. But the Dodgers' bullpen closed it out from there with Jansen finishing the victory in an encouraging performance heading into Game 7. It was Jansen’s first save chance in five appearances since closing out the Dodgers’ first playoff win this season in the wild-card round. He struck out the side on 12 pitches in Friday night’s 7-3 win. “Two huge outings not only for us but him personally you can just see the confidence he has on the mound attacking guys” Turner said. “That’s the Kenley Jansen I and all of us in there all know and love.” STRANGE PLAY Ozzie Albies hit a slow chopper down the first-base line in the Braves sixth that was fielded by Muncy who then made the tag before the ball popped out. Albies thought he was out and never touched first base. Muncy tossed the ball to Buehler who tagged the runner already heading back to the Atlanta dugout. GAME 7s The Dodgers are playing in a Game 7 for the third time in four years. They won 5-1 at Milwaukee in the deciding game of the 2018 NLCS after losing 5-1 at home to the Houston Astros in Game 7 of the 2017 World Series. Atlanta hasn’t played in a Game 7 since its 15-0 win over St. Louis in the 1996 NLCS. SHORT HOPS The 14 homers by Los Angeles are tied for the most in an NLCS and two behind the 2008 Tampa Bay Rays for the most in any LCS. ... Only once before have the Dodgers won three consecutive potential elimination games to take a series. That was in the best-of-five NL Division Series in 1981. They won the World Series that year. UP NEXT Braves: Anderson needed 85 pitches to get through four innings in Game 2 when he allowed only one hit with five strikeouts. But he walked five batters in a game Atlanta held on to win 8-7. Dodgers: Gonsolin’s postseason debut starting Game 2 came after Kershaw was scratched because of back spasms. Gonsolin struck out seven but allowed five runs in 4 1/3 innings.

330,Seager homers again Dodgers force NLCS Game 7 with 3-1 win," Miami avoided the post-Clemson letdown and now can set its sight on remaining in the conference championship picture. A week after a 42-17 road loss to the top-ranked Tigers the No. 13 Hurricanes beat Pittsburgh 31-19 on Saturday. D’Eriq King threw four touchdowns including two to Will Mallory to lead the Hurricanes (4-1 3-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) who never trailed in this one. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM “We were disappointed and a little bit angry coming off last week” Miami coach Manny Diaz said. “That’s a difficult situation — you have a noon kickoff not a super juicy environment because of the restrictions that we have and against a team with a sense of desperation. For those guys to go out there and know that it was not going to be an easy game regardless of your mental mindset says a lot about the leadership of our football team.” The Panthers (3-3 2-3) lost their third consecutive game and were without senior quarterback Kenny Pickett who suffered an ankle injury against Boston College last week. Entering Saturday's game Pickett led the nation with 1389 passing yards but didn’t travel with the team to South Florida. Redshirt freshman Joey Yellen replaced Pickett completing 22 of 46 passes for 277 yards and a touchdown. “You didn’t know what to expect; I thought he played solid” Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi said of Yellen. “I thought he put the ball in people’s hands to make plays. We’ve got to help him out.” Alex Kessman kicked four field goals for the Panthers and became Pitt's all-time leader with 57. Kessman surpassed Chris Blewitt who had 55 field goals from 2013-16. Pitt rallied from a 21-6 deficit with 10 unanswered points on Kessman’s record-setting third field goal and Yellen’s 1-yard touchdown pass to Daniel Moraga early in the third quarter. Marcus Williams’ 38-yard interception return to the Miami 1 set up Moraga’s score. But Miami regained its double-digit advantage on King’s 45-yard touchdown pass to Mallory. “As far as today I’m super proud of those guys” King said. “We put Clemson behind us and tried to put a W anyway we could. We knew we had a tough challenge in back-to-back weeks."" Kessman’s fourth conversion with 31 seconds remaining in the third quarter made it 28-19 before Jose Borregales gave Miami another double-digit cushion with his 37-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter. The drive drained 7:11 off the clock and prevented the Panthers from making a late comeback. “Pitt's defense is good every single year” King said. “They make you earn every single thing.” The Hurricanes struck first on King’s 35-yard touchdown pass to Cam’Ron Harris midway through the first quarter. King retreated from an attempted draw and found an open Harris down the middle. King connected with Mallory on a 6-yard score with 6:44 left in the second quarter for a 14-0 lead. Kessman kicked two field goals late in the second quarter and got the Panthers to within 14-6. Pitt settled for the second field goal after being unable to capitalize on a drive starting at the Miami 12 that was set by Harris Ford’s 25-yard interception return. King found an open Mike Harley down the right sideline for a 38-yard touchdown pass in Miami’s opening drive of the second half. Harley eluded a Panthers defender before reaching the end zone for his first TD reception of the season. THE TAKEAWAY The Hurricanes erased the frustrations of the loss at Clemson with quick-strike scores and a defense that allowed 22 yards rushing and forced Pitt to settle for field goals on three possessions inside the red zone. “Red-zone defense is a mentality to me that’s where it gets into the culture of your defensive room” Diaz said. “Really proud of them the way they went down there and never panicked and made them kick field goals.” POLL IMPLICATIONS Miami will probably hold steady in the rankings. MALLORY STEPS UP With pre-season All-American tight end Brevin Jordan missing the game because of a shoulder injury Mallory accepted additional responsibilities as his replacement. “When you got a player like Brevin out for the week someone’s got to fill those big shoes because he’s a heck of a player” Mallory said. “Coming in I hadn’t gotten as many passes this year.

Mullen made the announcement Saturday on Twitter saying his initial positive result was confirmed by a second test. The 10th-ranked Gators had at least 21 players and coaches test positive earlier this week an outbreak that prompted the Southeastern Conference to postpone Florida's next two games. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM With potentially dozens more quarantined because of contract tracing Florida (2-1) would have had fewer than 50 scholarship players available to face the defending national champion Tigers (1-2) in the Swamp. Two assistant coaches also tested positive for the highly contagious virus. Mullen is the second SEC head coach along with Alabama icon Nick Saban to contract COVID-19 and the fifth overall known this season in major-college football joining Florida State’s Mike Norvell Arizona’s Kevin Sumlin and Kansas’ Les Miles. Florida has started administering daily tests since it first suspected an outbreak following last week's loss at Texas A&amp;M. The 48-year-old Mullen says he has experienced “mild to no symptoms.” “I'm continuing to self-isolate from my family who all remain healthy and am following all the guidelines set forth by UF Health the CDC and our public health officials” Mullen tweeted. “I am proud of how our players staff and campus community have navigated this unprecedented time and hope all continue to be safe.” The Gators believe their outbreak started with two players — one experiencing congestion and the other a headache late last week. Both suspected allergies and didn't alert team doctors before getting on the team flight to Texas A&amp;M. Mullen raised eyebrows after the loss to the Aggies by saying he wanted to pack the Swamp against LSU. When given a chance to back down he doubled down. He was given another chance Monday and dug in more.

Isaiah Spiller ran for 114 yards and two touchdowns and Kellen Mond threw for two scores to help the No. 11 Aggies beat Mississippi State 28-14 on Saturday. “When you’re on the road you’ve got to be able to control clock control tempo and you’ve got to run the football to do that” Aggies coach Jimbo Fisher said. “And we did at times today. The other part was running out the last five six minutes of the game when we got the ball and we got down there and could have had a score. We didn’t but eating that clock up and not giving it back that was huge.” CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Texas A&amp;M (3-1) led 14-0 at the half and had 325 yards of total offense in the game. Ainias Smith caught five passes for 20 yards and a touchdown. Chase Lane caught two passes including a 51-yard touchdown reception in the opening minutes of the third quarter. Mississippi State (1-3) had little offensive rhythm for the third straight game. The Bulldogs’ first touchdown came on Emmanuel Forbes’ interception return in the third quarter. “I thought we literally squandered the first half” Bulldog coach Mike Leach said. “Right now we’re one team on Tuesday and Wednesday and another team on Saturday. We need to be able to transition that to the field. And if you think that’s frustrating for you you should try it from my perspective.” Leach benched starting quarterback KJ Costello midway through the second half for freshman Will Rogers same as he did last week in a 24-2 loss at Kentucky. Rogers connected with Malik Heath for a 15-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter. “Offensively we were a bunch of pincushions out there” Leach said. “And I think its mental on the part of our o-line because we can block our own defensive line consistently in practice and A&amp;M couldn’t even do that. So it’s definitely mental.” Texas A&amp;M’s defense continually disrupted the line of scrimmage finishing with six sacks and eight tackles for loss. Mississippi State had minus-2 yards rushing and just 217 yards of total offense. “Day 1 we believed in the game plan” tackle Jayden Peevy said. “We saw Kentucky come with a three-man front. We watched a lot of film against these guys. We saw (Kentucky) get a victory so we planned on it all week.” CONTROLLING THE CLOCK With just over 11 minutes left in the game Heath’s touchdown put Mississippi State down just two scores. The Aggies went three-and-out on their next possession but the Bulldogs couldn’t capitalize and Texas A&amp;M ran out the final five minutes by pounding the ball on the ground with eight straight rushes by Smith. POLL IMPLICATIONS Texas A&amp;M will look to move up in the Top 25 after the key Southeastern Conference road victory. The five teams immediately above the Aggies were all idle Saturday. THE TAKEAWAY The Aggies continue to put points on the board scoring 28 or more points for the second straight week. Meanwhile Leach’s maiden voyage in Starkville continues to take on water in a second straight home loss. UP NEXT Texas A&amp;M is off next week before hosting Arkansas. “Next week we have Arkansas” offensive lineman Carson Green said. “They’re a hell of a team. That’s why people love watching the SEC.

A lot of unranked people are beating ranked people and switching the whole Top 25 all the time.” Mississippi State also is off before hosting Alabama. , https://www.foxnews.com/sports/no-11-texas-am-beats-mississippi-state-28-14,0.8103122067572572
333,No. 11 Texas A&M beats Mississippi State 28-14, Mississippi quarterback Matt Corral entered Saturday's game against Arkansas with just one interception. He left with six more. The Razorbacks scored 24 points off seven Ole Miss turnovers and won a second Southeastern Conference game for the first time since 2016 beating the Rebels 33-21. The Arkansas (2-2 2-2) defense flustered Corral who entered the game second in the SEC in passing efficiency and yards passing. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The Razorback took advantage early pitching a 20-0 shutout behind three Ole Miss giveaways at halftime. Ole Miss didn’t punt in the second half with each of its eight series ending in either a turnover on downs or a touchdown. Two of the three second-half touchdowns resulted in the Rebels pulling within a touchdown but the interceptions resulted in the finish. Arkansas' redshirt freshman Hunter Clark had three of the interceptions including one to seal the game on Ole Miss’ final drive. Clark a walk-on cornerback was a surprise name on the depth chart last week at Auburn. Against the Rebels he found himself a surprise starter. “Well they’ve heard of him now. Three times at least” Arkansas coach Sam Pittman said. The three first-half turnovers weren’t the only Ole Miss (1-3 1-3) issue. Twice the Rebels were stopped at the 1 on fourth down. The first time came on a fumble the second an old-fashioned stuffing. Throw in the interceptions and Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin’s demeanor after the game was expected. “Had we not screwed all that up early we’re up by three or four scores” Kiffin said. “You can’t turn the ball over like that and expect to win.” Kiffin stuck with Corral and the sophomore nearly led a comeback. Corral threw for 200 yards and two scores which came late in the third quarter and early in the fourth to pull within 20-14. But Arkansas’ sophomore Treylon Burks answered on the ensuing drive. Burks who missed last week’s game at Auburn caught a one-handed touchdown pass in the corner of the end zone. He managed to place one foot inside the end zone before falling out of bounds. Burks finished with 11 catches for 137 yards and added another 46 yards rushing on four carries. Feleipe Franks was 21-of-34 passing for 244 yards with a touchdown and an interception for Arkansas. “The drive when it was 20-14 was huge” Pittman said. “Treylon what a great catch he had in the corner. What a wonderful catch an outstanding catch he made. That drive was huge.” And while the fourth-down failures early stalled the Rebels the conversions late kept them around. Ole Miss was 5 of 9 on such tries including a 47-yard run off a fake punt. Later in that drive Jerrion Ealy ran into the end zone from the 1 to make it 26-21. Ealy finished with 112 yards rushing on 23 carries. But the giveaways were too much. After forcing an Arkansas punt Corral threw his fifth interception and Grant Morgan’s 23-yard pick-6 with 3:07 left provided the game’s final points. “No excuses for a performance like that at all” Corral said. “With a performance like that you’re supposed to lose the game. That’s what happened.” THE TAKEAWAY Arkansas has won two SEC games for the first time since 2016. The Razorbacks six interceptions were their most since 2003 when they had six against Mississippi State. Ole Miss sits at the bottom of the SEC West and has given up the most points in the conference. FEELING GOOD Arkansas coach Sam Pittman was full of smiles after the game. The Razorbacks hadn’t won an SEC game the last two seasons and only won one the year before that. But he was on the Arkansas staff during the first years of the Bret Bielema era when the Razorbacks went to three straight bowl games. HE SAID IT “Look there’s not really any pressure on us” Pittman said. “The expectations weren’t high outside the building. … I don’t know as much about what happened over the last three years here. I knew this was Arkansas and this is where the University of Arkansas is supposed to be on the football field.” UP NEXT Arkansas has a bye next week before playing on Halloween at No. 11 Texas A&amp;M for the first time since 2012. The teams had played their games at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington Texas since.

334,Arkansas forces seven turnovers beats Ole Miss 33-21," Russell Henley left everyone in his wake with three straight birdies to start the back nine pivotal in turning a four-shot deficit into a three-shot lead by the end of the day in the CJ Cup at Shadow Creek. He is going for his fourth PGA Tour victory. He has never had a lead this large with 18 holes to play. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM And what Saturday made him realize was how quickly it can turn around at Shadow Creek — for him and the four players immediately behind him. “I’ve got to just keep my head down and play a good round for me” Henley said after a 5-under 67. “There's so much golf to be played. This is just a break we're taking and I'm just going to try to keep doing it.” He did enough on another still quiet warm day. And he had plenty of help from the other two players in his group. Xander Schauffele who had a three-shot lead going into the weekend had a pair of late bogeys and failed to capitalize on the par 5s in his round of 74. Tyrrell Hatton didn't make a birdie until the final hole in a 73. Of the top 25 players they were the only two who shot over par. Henley's putting has been a great fit for the firm glass-like greens of Shadow Creek. He leads the field in the most important putting category and it has carried him to only the second 54-hole lead of his PGA Tour career. He was at 15-under 201. Lanto Griffin who won his first PGA Tour event a year ago at the Houston Open found the water off the tee on the par-5 18th and made bogey and still managed a 66. He was at 12-under 204 along with Talor Gooch (69) Jason Kokrak (68) and Schauffele still in the mix despite a sloppy Saturday. Hatton was in the group five shots behind with Justin Thomas (68) and Jason Day who had a 66 as the former world No. 1 tries to end more than two years without a victory. Henley started to close the gap when he got up-and-down from a bunker in front of the green on the par-5 seventh and Schauffele missed the green on the par-3 eighth and took bogey. And when they made the turn Henley took off. He holed a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 10 hit driver just through the green on the reachable par-4 11th hole to set up a simple up-and-down for another birdie and then hit his approach to just inside 5 feet on No. 12 for a third straight birdie. Henley closed with six straight pars missing chances on the two par 5s but no one could catch him. But he knows what can happen having flipped his fortunes on Saturday. “Anybody can come at me” Henley said. “You can go low out here. The greens are great and it's gettable but you've got to play well to do that. You've got to do everything well."" Schauffele was hopeful of at least finishing his round at par and that didn't go his way either. He went long on the par-3 17th into rough so deep he could barely keep it on the green leading to his fourth bogey. And he went just over the back of the 18th green in two again in rough facing a downhill chip that he rolled all the way to the fringe. Schauffele likes to talk about “strokes gained attitude” and it was a struggle for him with rounds that stretching close to six hours at Shadow Creek because of deep rough limited marshals and plenty of searching. Sung Kang knows the feeling. He took an 11 on the par-4 second hole which included two lost balls when he spent more than three minutes looking and came up empty. He also hit a few backward trying to escape trouble. Nothing worked. Schauffele wasn't that bad. It just felt like it. “I was trying to figure out what was worse the pace of play or my quality of golf” he said. “It was kind of a tie today. Not to be a sour person but just one of those days. Today was my bad day for the week. Got it out of the way before Sunday. I guess I'm in a familiar place being three back now."" Schauffele has been trailing going into the final round in all four of his PGA Tour victories. Henley's last victory was in 2017 at the Houston Open where he came from four shots behind in the final round. Now he has a cushion at Shadow Creek and a hot putter on putting surfaces he loves.

Jurkovec threw for 345 yards and two touchdowns but he also turned the ball over three times. THE TAKEAWAYS Boston College: Turnovers doomed the Eagles after they came in with just three turnovers in their first four games. BC drove inside the Virginia Tech 30 on its first two possessions and fumbled both times squandering opportunities to grab an early lead and take control of the game. Virginia Tech: After getting most of their primary players back on defense (COVID and injuries) the Hokies finally got a solid performance from that unit which had allowed 24 points in each of Virginia Tech’s first three games.

The Crimson Tide (4-0) with coach Nick Saban stalking the sideline after a COVID-19 scare rallied with three touchdowns in a 10-minute span starting late in the third quarter of a battle of the Southeastern Conference's last remaining unbeatens. The nation's top scoring offense ultimately got the decisive upper hand in a battle with the Bulldogs (3-1) and one of the nation's best defenses. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Georgia had no answer for Jones and star receivers Jaylen Waddle and DeVonta Smith especially with Alabama's own beleaguered defense grabbing two second-half interceptions and three overall. Smith caught 11 passes for 167 yards and two touchdowns including one in the fourth quarter that effectively put it out of reach. Waddle caught a 90-yard touchdown pass and gained 161 yards on six catches. Then there was some old-school ground and pound too. Harris gained 152 yards on 31 carries carries with a touchdown during that game-clinching span. He did it against the nation's top run defense which came in allowing 38 rushing yards and 12.3 points per game. Stetson Bennett completed 18 of 40 passes for 269 yards and two touchdowns including an 82-yarder to James Cook. But he threw three interceptions. Alabama got a boost about seven hours before the game when the SEC cleared coach Saban to return to business of usual determining a Wednesday COVID test was a false positive. He tested negative Thursday Friday and Saturday. A maskless Saban was yelling at a referee after an intentional grounding call in the second quarter. The Tide has won the last six meetings with Georgia including a 3-0 record against Saban's former defensive coordinator Kirby Smart. The first two came in the January 2018 national championship game and the SEC championship game the following season.

The offense just continues to roll along and those receivers just appear unstoppable. Georgia: Led 24-20 deep into the third quarter and gained a solid 410 yards. But the defense that had been so suffocating more than met its match.

The Seminoles gave coach Mike Norvell a signature victory in his first season in Tallahassee following a shaky start that included a blowout loss at Miami. Travis a redshirt sophomore completed 8 of 19 passes for 191 yards and ran 16 times for 107 yards as the Seminoles jumped out to a 31-7 halftime lead the most dominating performance for the program in recent memory. What followed was a nail-biting second half as the Tar Heels mounted a comeback attempt. Howell completed 20 of 36 yards for 374 yards against the Seminoles whom he was committed to for about six months in 2018 before signing with North Carolina just weeks after Mack Brown was hired. North Carolina was 13th in FBS in third-down conversions (51%) coming into the game but the Tar Heels were just 2 of 11 on third-down conversions and 0 for 3 on fourth-down tries. Florida State ran for a season-high 241 yards on 36 carries. La'Damian Webb had 109 yards on 12 carries. The win was the Seminoles’ first over an AP Top 25 team since Boston College on Nov. 17 2018. Florida State’s last win over a Top 10 team was No. 6 Michigan in the Orange Bowl on Dec. 30 2016. POLL IMPLICATIONS North Carolina will likely tumble possibly out of the Top 10 when the rankings come out Sunday. TAKEAWAYS The Tar Heels looked impressive in putting up 56 points in victory last week against Virginia Tech. North Carolina controlled the time of possession and racked up yards at various points but struggled to put points on the board until the third quarter.

0,None,"Washington has chosen to start 2020 by bringing its already strained relations with Iran to a whole new level of confrontation as it ordered the killing of one of Tehran’s top generals Qassem Soleimani. The high-profile assassination is bound to make things difficult for the State Department. And that’s not to mention that it is far from being the only problem Pompeo and his staff have on their hands. Yet instead of seeking to revive stalled denuclearization talks with North Korea or soothing the ruffled feathers of European NATO allies the secretary of state plans to visit several former Soviet republics: Belarus Ukraine Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in the vast Central Asian steppes. Most Americans may be forgiven for ""knowing"" about Kazakhstan via English comedian Sasha Baron Cohen’s 2006 movie 'Borat' which actually has nothing to do with the country and is sort of offensive to bring up there. The Central Asian nation independent since 1991 has signed treaties on cooperation with both the US and NATO while maintaining cordial relations with Moscow and Beijing. So what awaits Pompeo in Nur-Sultan formerly Astana Kazakhstan's capital recently renamed in honor of its first president? The level of interaction between Washington and Nur-Sultan was “stable but relatively weak” Vladimir Batyuk a senior fellow at the Russian Institute for the US and Canadian Studies told RT. “Their common arrangements have been usually limited to some low-level meetings.” America’s renewed interest to Kazakhstan might be a result of the recent developments in nearby Afghanistan where the 18-year-long war is showing no sign of ending well for Washington. President Donald Trump's promise to pull out of America's longest war was thwarted at the very beginning of his administration by hawkish establishment advisers. Later he abruptly canceled peace talks with the Taliban militants when a peace deal seemed within reach. Recent reports that US generals and officials had known for years that the war in Afghanistan was unwinnable may help nudge Washington into actually calling it quits however. That is not to say the US has given up on the dream of having a base in the region though and Kazakhstan may seem like a good prospect to some in Foggy Bottom. “Now they would need Central Asia as its base of operations” Aleksey Pilko director of the Eurasian Communications Center told RT. US withdrawal from Afghanistan is almost guaranteed to result in the resurgence of the Taliban. The hardline Islamist militants already control much of the country. Washington may seek to expand its influence in neighboring countries by bringing up potential security issues and counter-terrorism cooperation. However a withdrawal from Afghanistan is also likely to weaken the US position in the region and make it that much more difficult to position itself as a security provider for Central Asian nations Pilko believes. Kazakhstan is a major regional power and the biggest state in Central Asia at one time contributing 60 percent of the regional GDP. It is also a major uranium exporter and has significant oil and gas reserves. These facts alone could be enough for Washington to turn its eye to Nur-Sultan. What might be equally important is that Kazakhstan is conveniently located between Washington's two major geopolitical adversaries – China and Russia – which makes it a very valuable piece in the geostrategic puzzle. In fact Washington has indeed become conspicuously interested in “strengthening bilateral relations” with Nur-Sultan after longstanding Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev – a close ally and friend of Russia’s Vladimir Putin – stepped down to give way to a younger national leader. “Kazakhstan is a key state in the region so it is no wonder that the US state secretary pays a visit there” Pilko explained. “The Kazakh leadership has changed… Now the US sees a need to sound out the situation and talk to the former and the current presidents to find out what is happening and what the new leader’s policy will be.” Pompeo has already given a warm welcome to the Kazakh Foreign Minister Mukhtar Tleuberdi in Washington in mid-December and claimed on Twitter that the “strategic partnership” between the two nations “has never been stronger.” The State Department then rushed to laud growing commercial ties between the US and Kazakhstan as well as President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s “ambitious reform agenda” adding that the “human rights crisis” in neighboring Chinese Xinjiang and “lasting peace” in Afghanistan were also discussed during the meeting. It is on Tleuberdi’s invitation that Pompeo is now planning to arrive to Kazakhstan. Little is officially known about this supposed trip so far however with most news coming from Kazakh officials. ""The program will be eventful” Kazakh Foreign Ministry spokesman Aybek Smadiyarov told journalists in early December. Other reports suggested that Pompeo will unveil nothing less than a new US strategy for Central Asia during the visit. Washington might have good reasons to approach Kazakhstan. However whether it has the means to achieve its goals is another matter entirely. Even if Pompeo plays the US security assistance card during his visit it is unclear whether that will be enough to sway the local establishment’s opinions in favor of Washington’s plans for the region. Kazakhstan is already deeply integrated with Russia and several other former Soviet Republics both in economic and military fields. The nation is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) – an inter-governmental military alliance which also includes Russia Armenia Belarus and two of Kazakhstan’s Central Asian neighbors Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The bloc is primarily tasked with fending off any military aggression against its members as well as fighting terrorism. Kazakhstan is also a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) an economic integration body. The EAEU is roughly similar to the EU’s Common Market in that it allows free movement of goods services and people and sets out common policies in various fields of economy ranging from transport industry energy and agriculture to customs and investment. In addition to Russia and Kazakhstan it also includes Belarus Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. It is also worth noting that China and Russia - not the US - are Kazakhstan’s biggest trading partners. Almost 40 percent of Kazakhstan’s imports come from Russia with an additional 16 percent arriving from China. US goods by comparison amount to slightly more than four percent. China is also the second most important Kazakh export market while Russia is the fourth one. However meticulously Pompeo plans to study all the peculiarities of Kazakh politics during his upcoming visit Tokayev has already quite openly said that he would follow the steps of his predecessor in international relations which most likely means continued close cooperation with both Russia and China. The biggest obstacle to Pompeo’s potential diplomatic success might however lie not in Nur-Sultan but in Washington itself Batyuk believes. President Trump largely focuses on geo-economics in his foreign policy locking horns with adversaries and allies alike in his attempts to win extra trade preferences for the US. “It is economics that is important for Trump.

1,None,"The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) issued a request (RFI) late in December seeking the latest and greatest in AI and drone swarm tech – and looking for clever ideas on how to combine the two. The resulting smart-swarm the agency said should be self-directing able to find and track humans (“and manmade objects” the RFI specifies) on its own capable of streaming video of its activities and willing to nudge its minders (who won’t be minding it most of the time since it’s primarily AI-powered) when it has latched on to something interesting. The swarm will have to be able to move at least 50 knots (93 km/h) stay in the air for at least 2 hours and cover 100 square nautical miles (343 square km). The official purpose of the “smart swarm” is search and rescue the RFI explains while the JAIC program comprises four ""mission initiatives"" – ""predictive maintenance humanitarian aid and disaster relief and cyberspace and robotic process automation."" So where is number four? The RFI isn't telling but we can speculate based on what JAIC is known to do. The AI-specialist department which only debuted in 2018 ended up running Project Maven the initiative to weaponize machine-learning and Big Data that was supposedly rejected by Google after employees got cold feet about helping the Pentagon kill people. Project Maven has not only beefed up the quality of video input from tactical drones or used computing power to organize the mountains of data obtained through surveillance it has taught participants how to “use algorithms for war.”  Will a smart swarm capable of hunting humans with minimal outside direction – along the lines specified in the RFI – follow the rules and stick to search and rescue or will its AI confuse it with “search and destroy”? If the Pentagon’s humans can’t tell a civilian from a terrorist how are its drone swarms supposed to be able to? And even if the algorithms work just fine what’s to stop the humans in charge from using their new toys for killing? JAIC works with DARPA and other secretive high-level Pentagon agencies; if the US military were ever to develop a swarm of killer drones capable of operating without human input (they already have drone swarms that work with human guides) it would happen there. Before you think “but they wouldn’t dare” it would be exceedingly hard to prosecute an AI algorithm for war crimes especially one written in open source. We’ve seen this movie before literally. The “Hated in the Nation” episode of the techno-dystopian TV show Black Mirror features a swarm of autonomous drone “bees” who’ve taken the place of the real thing after a mass die-off; this digital hive proves hackable and every day a single solitary drone bee assassin is weaponized to kill whichever public figure garners the most social media hate. Bees lost at such a slow pace no matter the kamikaze drama of their last seconds mean the hive-minders never mind. The bee-masters in Black Mirror defend their creation by blustering about “military-grade” encryption insisting no one could ever hack their high-tech better-than-nature-made-them pollinators. By that point however someone already had.  Military-grade encryption is only as good as the backdoors deliberately installed in it and Attorney General William Barr and the whole Five Eyes intelligence network are intent on installing enough backdoors to keep them busy peeking through your private data for the rest of their lives. Once they do that everyone’s drone swarm – literally and figuratively – belongs to everyone else. If there was ever a time not to rush into manufacturing an apocalyptic technology it would be now.  Like this story? Share it with a friend!

2,None,"The 82nd’s alert brigade was ordered to deploy on Tuesday evening Fox News reported citing multiple Pentagon officials shortly before Defense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed the move. ""The United States will protect our people and interests anywhere they are found around the world"" Esper said announcing the deployment. The initial force has already departed Fort Bragg North Carolina on board C-17 transports. The Immediate Response Force (IRF) consists of an estimated 4000 soldiers of the 82nd Deployment Ready Brigade (DRB) whose three battalions can be fielded within 96 hours if needed. Hundreds of members of the Iraqi Shia militia Kataib Hezbollah stormed the US Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday chanting “Death to America” and setting the entrance checkpoint on fire. They were protesting against US airstrikes that killed 25 of their members over the weekend in what the Pentagon said was retaliation for last week’s rocket strike at a US base in Kirkuk that killed one contractor. The militia withdrew after a task force of some 100 US Marines accompanied by attack helicopters showed up to reinforce the embassy. US President Donald Trump has blamed Iran for the attack and openly threatened Tehran with a “big price” to pay. There are currently 60000 US troops in the Middle East of which some 5000 are in Iraq. Almost 14000 of those have been added since May 2019 with the Pentagon citing a rising “threat” from Iran. In May 2018 the Trump administration unilaterally repudiated the nuclear deal negotiated with Tehran in 2015 and imposed sanctions intended to destroy the Iranian economy. Despite Trump’s campaign rhetoric about ending US involvement in endless foreign wars his advisers have repeatedly called for what amounts to regime change in Tehran. Like this story?

3,None,From his perch on Twitter President Trump shared a brief video clip showing a line of parked cars set ablaze in Paris on the cusp of the New Year on Tuesday adding only a simple caption: While the motive behind the sizable (and likely quite expensive) 'car-b-que' remains unknown the arson comes amid mass demonstrations around the country in opposition to an overhaul of the French pension system which in some cases have erupted into violent street clashes with riot police. Trade unions and other labor organizations have staged mass strikes and walkouts over the proposal which the government insists will simplify the pension system and ensure it is “fair.” The wave of anti-pension reform demonstrations follows another protest movement sparked last year by a fuel tax hike the 'Yellow Vests' who have continued to stage mass actions intermittently ever since. The two groups joined forces over the weekend in a joint protest to voice discontent with Macron’s government. At President Trump’s direction in 2017 Washington ditched the Paris climate accord a multilateral agreement among a majority of the world’s nations dealing with greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues. Dismissing it as “draconian” Trump has repeatedly mocked Macron about the deal since the US withdrawal once even suggesting the accord itself was responsible for the country’s ongoing unrest.

4,None,Taking to Twitter on Tuesday evening hours after the embassy was nearly ransacked by members of the Iraqi Shia militia Kataib Hezbollah protesting against the US airstrike that killed 25 of their own over the weekend Pompeo posted photos purporting to show the alleged perpetrators of the failed storming attempt. “The attack today was orchestrated by terrorists – Abu Mahdi al Muhandis and Qays al-Khazali – and abetted by Iranian proxies – Hadi al Amari and Faleh al-Fayyad. All are pictured below outside our embassy” Pompeo wrote. The photos accompanying the post show the crowd outside the US Embassy on Tuesday Pompeo claimed arguing that the four militia leaders were mingling with the protesters. The top US diplomat did not produce evidence to support the claim that any of the photographed individuals played a role in stirring the unrest itself which was originally sparked by the US bombing raid and drew outrage from the Iraqi government and citizens alike. Pompeo then attempted to make a distinction between “the legitimate efforts of the Iraqi protesters” opposing the government in Baghdad and those behind the embassy attack. While the protests against pervasive corruption and the government’s failure to provide better living conditions for Iraqis have rocked the country since October and saw bloody clashes between security forces and demonstrators Pompeo did not miss a chance to point a finger at Tehran as the main culprit behind Iraq’s internal political woes arguing that corruption was “exported there by the Iranian regime.” Tehran has flatly rejected the allegations that it fanned the unrest slamming Washington’s “audacity” to blame Iran for protests triggered by American airstrikes which the Pentagon claimed were in retaliation for an attack on a US coalition base near the Iraqi city of Kirkuk. Iraq’s economy and infrastructure were left in a shambles after two decades of intermittent war and sectarian violence following the 2003 US invasion which also took a heavy toll on the average citizen leaving many without the most basic services including access to clean water.

5,None,With simmering tensions between Tehran and Washington flaring up over an attack on the US Embassy in Baghdad which the US blamed squarely on Iran without providing any proof there have been growing fears that another war of words could spiral into something far more violent. In an apparent attempt to diffuse the tension Trump said late on Tuesday that he does not foresee a war actually breaking out between the US and Iran. “War with Iran? I don’t think that would be a good idea for Iran... I like peace... I don’t see that happening” Trump told media as he arrived at the grand ballroom at Mar-a-Lago for a New Year bash on Tuesday night. Tehran has vehemently denied allegations that it is somehow complicit in the unrest sparked by US airstrikes that killed 25 members of the Iraqi Shia militia Kataib Hezbollah over the weekend. The American sorties have drawn the ire of the Iraqi government which called the bombing a violation of the country’s sovereignty as well as of militiamen and ordinary citizens who flocked to the US Embassy in Iraq to protest against the airstrikes. Protests turned violent on Tuesday as demonstrators attempted to storm the compound and saw US attack helicopters being scrambled to scatter the protesters after they'd reportedly breached the front gate. In the wake of the attack the Pentagon announced that it would send 750 paratroopers to the Middle East “immediately” in response to the incident which will be followed by “additional forces.” Washington has repeatedly invoked the “Iranian threat” to beef up its military presence in the region having deployed some 14000 troops to the Middle East since May 2019 in addition to about 60000 already stationed there.

6,None,Massachusetts senator and Democratic 2020 hopeful Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday took aim at the president for a US bombing raid ordered on an Iraqi militia over the weekend. American officials accused the group – Kataib Hezbollah – of carrying out a rocket attack on a US base with Iranian backing which killed one American contractor though they have yet to offer any evidence for the claims of responsibility. “Trump’s reckless decisions to walk away from the Iran deal and now to launch airstrikes in Iraq without Iraqi government consent have brought us closer to war and endangered US troops and diplomats” Warren said in a statement online. The US air raid left 25 Iraqi fighters dead and prompted a heated demonstration at the US Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday afternoon in which militiamen and ordinary citizens breached the front gate of the embassy complex smashing windows and scrawling anti-American slogans on its walls. Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) – who sponsored a bipartisan bill with Kentucky Republican Rand Paul to prevent an “unauthorized war” with the Islamic Republic earlier this year – also weighed in to slam Trump’s response to the unrest which included the deployment of a Marine task force and attack helicopters to defend the embassy. “At a volatile time the Trump administration’s reckless escalation and miscalculation are endangering US citizens &amp; pushing us closer to unauthorized war in the Middle East” Udall wrote in a tweet adding that “Congress needs to step in and stop it.” Democratic presidential candidate and Southbend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg joined his fellow lawmakers on Twitter to attack the president for “mood swings” and making “policy by tweet” arguing his actions in Iraq only served to put US “national interests in harm’s way.” Far from the most dovish Democrat vying for the 2020 nomination however Buttigieg accepted that the policies were a response to “Iranian aggression” despite disagreeing with them. Across the aisle some Republicans were far more supportive fully endorsing the commander-in-chief’s recent moves. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) credited Trump with “very solid work” and hailed the Marine deployment as a “decisive action” needed “in a time of crisis” insisting there was “zero question” about who was behind the rocket attack on the US base. One of Trump’s biggest boosters as of late Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) also lavished praise on the president after a meeting to discuss the tense situation in Iraq accusing Iran of threatening “American interests” and warning that they do so at their own risk. Comparing the embassy siege to a lethal attack on a US diplomatic facility in Libya in 2012 Graham urged that there be “no more Benghazis.” In the latest US response the Pentagon announced a deployment of some 750 paratroopers to neighboring Kuwait on Tuesday evening which Defense Secretary Mark Esper said could be mobilized in days to “protect our people and interests.” Though few lawmakers have yet weighed in on the new deployment the battle lines in Washington appear to already be drawn.

8,None,A woman seeking the Pope’s blessing on New Year’s Eve instead ended up enraging the pontiff after grabbing his arm to get his attention. A video of the altercation shows Francis walking through Vatican City as he greeted pilgrims. After reaching out to touch a child a nearby woman seized his hand jerking the religious leader around – a yank that appeared to cause him pain. After slapping her hand several times the Pope freed himself of her grip. The usually serene Francis scowled as he walked away. According to reports the Pope later acknowledged that he had “lost patience” with the admiring pilgrim. Francis has a history of repelling unwanted contact. In March he was criticized for refusing to allow members of the faithful to kiss his papal ring during a visit to an Italian shrine. Like this story?

9,None,Chandrayaan-3 India's third lunar exploration mission will attempt to land on the Moon again Jitendra Singh minister of state for department of space confirmed Wednesday. “Yes the [next] lander and rover mission will happen in 2020” he told the media. Singh said the new spacecraft will incorporate lessons learned during last year's Chandrayaan 2 mission which attempted to deploy a lander called Vikram but suddenly fell silent during hard touchdown “within 500m of the designated landing site.” However Chandrayaan 2 can't be seen as failure the official explained. Revealing some details about the mission ISRO chief K Sivan said that Chandrayaan-3 – which is set to launch in November this year – will be similar to its predecessor. “In Chandrayaan-3 we will have landing and rover with propulsion module” he said adding “this is going to be an eventful year for ISRO.” India is striving to become the fourth country after the US USSR and China to land on the Moon. Chandrayaan 2 stands out from other missions as it attempted to land at the little-explored South Pole. It was tasked with gathering data on the lunar surface searching for water and minerals. Among other things the mission’s goal was recording and measuring moonquakes. As part of an ambitious space exploration program India also hopes to launch the Gaganyaan India's first manned mission to space by 2022. ISRO has already done plenty of research and development work on the mission Sivan revealed.

10,None,Wednesday’s deployment used military helicopters and naval vessels to deliver water food and fuel to areas that have been completely cut off by the fires in the states of New South Wales and Victoria. An estimated 4000 people in the Victorian coastal town of Mallacoota fled to the seashore on Tuesday after winds pushed wildfires toward their homes. The Australian Defence Force is sending navy ships to Mallacoota on a supply mission that is expected to last two weeks Victoria Emergency Commissioner Andrew Crisp told local media. He said firefighters would be flown into the area via helicopter since the roads are no longer accessible. The massive bushfires have destroyed more than four million hectares (10 million acres). High winds and extreme heat have sparked new blazes almost daily. The fires have claimed 12 lives since the beginning of October.

11,None,"Dozens of protesters who'd camped overnight outside the gates of the embassy were attacked with tear gas by security personnel reportedly after the demonstrators drew closer to the building. Purported footage of Wednesday’s clashes shows protesters shouting and throwing objects toward the compound walls as thick smoke fills the air. Several bright flashes – likely from tear gas canisters being fired – can also be seen. The crowd also reportedly set multiple US flags on fire. Several protesters were wounded and were brought away in ambulances according to AFP. The skirmish comes a day after thousands of Iraqis marched on the compound to protest against US airstrikes that had targeted several Hezbollah positions. The demonstrators were able to pass through several checkpoints in the high-security Green Zone setting fires and destroying surveillance cameras. In response to the attack US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said around 750 troops were ready to deploy to the region over the next several days. President Donald Trump has blamed Iran for the turmoil and warned that Tehran would pay dearly if any US personnel were injured or killed by the demonstrators. Iran pushed back at the accusation noting that Washington had the “audacity” to blame the Islamic Republic for protests in Iraq. US airstrikes hit five Kataib Hezbollah targets in Iraq and Syria last week in retaliation for an attack on a US coalition base near Kirkuk. Washington blamed that attack on the Iran-allied militia but Tehran has denied any involvement calling the subsequent  US strikes an act of ""terrorism."" Like this story? Share it with a friend!

13,None,On the heels of the siege on Tuesday of the US diplomatic mission in Baghdad President Trump fired off a series of inflammatory tweets vowing to hold Iran “fully responsible for lives lost or damage incurred at any of our facilities.” Shortly thereafter he took a different tone saying he doesn’t see a war with Iran coming. But the initial escapade didn’t go unnoticed in Tehran with Ali Khamenei returning the verbal attack by “that guy.” The Supreme Leader stated that “you can’t do anything” before referring Trump to recent US invasions of countries bordering Iran. Khamenei has also taken aim at the US sorties which killed 25 members of Kataib Hezbollah – the Iraqi Shia militia that forms part of pro-Iranian Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) – last weekend. “Look at what the US is doing in Iraq and Syria. They’re taking revenge on Hashd al-Sha’bi for defeating ISIS [Islamic State]” he said in a tweet using an Arabic term for PMU. The strikes carried out without approval from Iraq sparked fury among its citizens with crowds sneaking into the heavily-guarded Green Zone and amassing outside the US Embassy on Tuesday. Many were shouting “Death to America!” and “Down with USA!” before trying to breach the compound. The US Ambassador and senior staff were moved to safety but the Pentagon swiftly sent 750 troops to Iraq in order to reinforce security in and around the mission. On Wednesday morning numerous protesters who'd camped overnight outside the main gates tried to come closer again hurling stones at the building.

19,None,In a new publication from Zero Waste Scotland entomophagy (the practice of humans eating insects) could be the future with the report suggesting that a change from cattle to critters could be lucrative and better for the environment. Dr William Clark ZWS’s bio-economy specialist says that insects would offer a sustainable way to produce more food using less resources: “Insect farms offer a reliable sustainable circular-economy solution to the protein gap. For although the world produces enough food for everyone more than a third of it goes to waste so people don’t get the protein they need.” With half a million tons of agricultural feedstock thrown away each year the report also adds that using just 10 percent of that for insect farming would produce almost six million pounds for the Scottish economy. For those wanting to start their own farm it’s good to note that in one year bugs produce about 100 times more protein from the same amount of space than you would get by farming sheep or cows and insects can also produce valuable by-products such as biodiesel bioplastics and organic fertilizers. But are eco warriors prepared to eat black soldier flies and field crickets in a quest to save the planet? While the food buzz around creepy critters has been around for a few years a company in Cape Town suggests you eat your food container too. Munchbowls are an eco-friendly green alternative to toxic wasteful plastic and polystyrene food containers. Made with biodegradable wheat they can be stored for up to 15 months and they are vegan too. Meanwhile environmentalists wanting the whole package in 2020 should take note of Avani a company based in Bali who have created an edible bag. Made from cassava root starch and other natural resins they break down within three to six months and can be dissolved or eaten. When that diet leads to inevitable suicidal thoughts why not finish off with a cannabis cookie for desert? The global market for both legal and illegal cannabis stands at $150 billion and 2020 is set to see that figure steadily grow. Spiros Malandrakis from market research company Euromonitor says the industry is just at its beginning: “I think in the next two to three years we will start seeing a vast number of other cannabinoids that are not yet under the limelight. There’s a million questions to be asked and we’re just scratching the surface.” With unlimited articles TV shows forums and celebrities now discussing the positive medical uses of cannabis it seems the negative reputation of weed-smoking grungy students is slowly morphing into being more socially accepted. Cannabis is also getting green - with new sustainable cultivation and manufacturing practices used by several companies in America. Manufacturers are now looking at environmentally friendly production methods in regards to irrigation and farming in the hope to appease plant-loving eco warriors. Whether enjoying an insectivorous diet or eating carrier bags will become a cultural phenomenon for the eco-conscious or not the roaring twenties will no doubt see many fads attempting to become mainstream. Let’s just hope they taste as good as the ideas themselves. Like this story? Share it with a friend! , https://www.rt.com/news/477273-eating-insects-save-environment/,0.8104013902608211
20,None,Live footage from RT’s video agency Ruptly showed protesters with Hezbollah flags withdrawing en masse in their vehicles. Some lingered behind at the scene of the clashes where tear gas and stun grenades were reportedly fired again on Wednesday. By Wednesday evening however the US military stated that all had departed. Hordes of protesters descended on Baghdad’s American embassy – located inside the heavily fortified ‘Green Zone’ – on Tuesday. Incensed by Sunday’s US airstrikes against the Kataib Hezbollah militia the crowd lit fires and pelted the embassy with stones. A contingent of US Marines arrived on Tuesday night to bolster security. Kataib Hezbollah is an Iranian-backed Shi’ite militia allied with an umbrella group of similar militias known as the ‘Popular Mobilization Forces’ (PMF) who are supposed to be under the command of the Iraqi military. The PMF on Wednesday told the crowds at the embassy to withdraw claiming that their “message has been heard” and to allow the Iraqi government to “preserve the prestige of the state.” However the call to pull back was initially been ignored by a number of the protesters. While some stood down a faction of hardliners remained behind until Wednesday evening. The embassy said in a statment that evening that all consular operations have been suspended until further notice. Washington has blamed Iran for orchestrating the embassy riots and for directing militias like Kataib Hezbollah to attack its forces in Iraq. Tehran denies all responsibility with Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei telling Trump that “your crimes in Iraq Afghanistan… have made nations hate you.” With the embassy showdown turning into another proxy battle between Iran and the US Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has sought to balance relations with both sides. The PM called the US airstrikes a “vicious assault that will have dangerous consequences” but warned protesters against any aggression towards foreign embassies. Like this story?

21,None,"Puzzled viewers of Ukraine's 5 Kanal and Pryamiy channel discovered that the two seemingly preferred Poroshenko to the actual President Volodymyr Zelensky on New Year's Eve. The man was given airtime right before midnight when the whole country gathered in front of their TVs with champagne-filled glasses. But was it an epic fail or an epic provocation? The latter seems to be the case as Poroshenko who is a major oligarch in Ukraine with a successful confectionery business and other assets is the official owner of 5 Kanal. The 54-year-old is also linked to Pryamiy although he denies getting involved with the broadcaster's editorial policies. In his address Zelensky's beaten rival praised his past achievements during own time in office saying among other things that it allowed creation of ""a large margin of safety"" for the impulse for change in Ukraine which will now be very hard to stagger. Poroshenko was destroyed by comedian-turned-politician Zelensky in the presidential election in April 2019 being only able to claim 24.5 percent of the vote in the second round. But despite the painful loss he hasn't quit politics taking the reins at the European Solidarity Party in hopes of returning to power. It turns out the two channels didn't drop Zelensky's address completely. They showed it to their audiences after midnight leaving them with two speeches and a feeling of déjà vu. Ironically Poroshenko's move seems to be a tit-for-tat response to his political rival as Zelensky got away with a similar stunt in December 2018. Back then 1+1 channel of oligarch Igor Kolomoysky broadcasted Zelensky's New Year address instead of the one by Poroshenko. In that clip the comedian announced that he was joining the presidential race. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

22,None,Appearing on Channel 4’s ‘The Last Leg’ on New Year’s Eve Jones was asked what she thought of the 16-year-old campaigner who was named Time Magazine’s ‘Person of the Year’ for 2019. “I think Greta’s amazing and what she’s doing is brilliant” the disabled comedian said. “But don’t do it now.” While the joke sent the studio audience into fits of laughter some viewers instantly took to Twitter to complain. “What example are we setting to young people making a change if we allow jokes like that to be aired?!” activist and BBC contributor Mandy Rose Jones opined. “Massive f**king yikes” declared another offended commenter deploying a catchphrase most often used by liberal complainers on Reddit. Another called Jones “one sick individual.” Amid scores of outraged comments some viewers chimed in to defend Jones. “Good on Rosie Jones” one wrote. “Given the scale of what both propose &amp; the societal upheaval (not excluding violence) that both advocate to bring it about no reason why Thunberg should be insulated from criticism interrogation &amp; mockery any more than radical Islam should.” Despite what the online outrage would suggest Jones’ gag was relatively tame as far as British comedy goes. Glaswegian funnyman Frankie Boyle for example has built a career on pushing boundaries entertaining sellout crowds with jokes about rape and pedophilia. Back in 2012 Boyle faced cries of ‘Ban this filth’ for joking that ‘Maddie’ the first name of missing child Madeleine McCann is an anagram of “I’m dead.” Boyle told his critics “you can’t argue with a joke – it’s like telling a clown their car won’t pass its MOT.” Like this story?

23,None,"Blue-and-yellow Ukrainian national flags mingled with the red-and-black banners of Bandera's Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and its armed wing the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) responsible for the mass murder and persecution during the last years of the Second World War in what is today western Ukraine. Carrying lit torches marchers chanted slogans such as ""Ukraine before everything"" ""Glory to Ukraine death to enemies"" and ""Glory to Ukraine glory to heroes!"" – the latter a WWII-era slogan of the OUN-UPA that came to be widely adopted since the 2014 coup first by the ultra-nationalists and then by the government and the military. The event in the capital featured some participants dressed up in period uniforms while others carried Bandera's photos as if they were icons in a church procession. The soundtrack to the menacing cortege was provided by a band of well-coordinated drummers. The musicians were sporting military-style uniforms and had their faces covered with balaclavas. The rally was agreed with the city authorities who deployed a large police force along its route.    Bandera's birthday January 1 has been a national holiday in Ukraine since 2019. He was born in 1909 in what was the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia (Galizien) at the time and became part of Poland after the First World War. While the OUN got its start agitating against Polish rule Bandera emerged as a leader of a hardline faction in 1940 hoping to establish an independent Ukrainian state with the help of Nazi Germany. Ukrainian nationalists point out that the Germans initially had no use for Bandera and the OUN placing him under house arrest in 1941 before sending him to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. However they did release Bandera in 1944 hoping that his UPA militants would help the Wehrmacht hold back the Soviet advance. Following the Allied victory the OUN-UPA switched sponsors from the defeated Nazis to the victorious Western Allies. Bandera moved to West Germany where he continued to agitate for ""free Ukraine"" at the dawn of the Cold War. He was killed in 1959 when a KGB assassin shot him with a cyanide-loaded dart. After Ukraine became independent in 1991 nationalists sought to establish Bandera as a national hero over the objections of Russia Poland and Israel. He was honored with the title of ""Hero of Ukraine"" by the Ukrainian government in 2010 – only for that title to be stripped by a court months later and by a new administration amid a vast international outcry.

24,None,Rolling out a list of “eerily prescient” predictions in order to brag about their accuracy – no flying cars here! – the National Intelligence Council (NIC) report is just what one might expect from an intel community desperate to shore up its reputation ahead of what’s sure to be a hotly contested presidential election. Intel vets have lamented that the intelligence community has become politicized to the point where it has affected their ability to accurately and objectively describe the reality in front of them – never mind the world 15 years in the future. The NIC paper may thus represent a lost art of apolitical prognostication a skill willingly sacrificed in the rush for modern spooks to prove themselves “team players.” After the near-fatal blow to its credibility dealt by the three-year Russiagate debacle US intelligence has a long way to go to build its reputation back.  But US intelligence has played enough of a role in crafting the world of 2020 that at least some of the report’s predictions have to be viewed as plans and suggestions rather than prognostication. Revelations about the CIA’s role in funding and training Al-Qaeda affiliates in Syria supplying weapons which often ended up in the hands of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists through Operation “Timber Sycamore” cast the report’s “fictional scenario” about “a new caliphate” whose adherents include Osama bin Laden's grandson in a more sinister light. Like IS the fictional caliphate described by the NIC inspires “non-practicing Muslims” from Europe and America to return to their ancestral homelands and take up arms against the “infidels”; also like IS they seize large swaths of territory in an Iraq weakened by years of war. With plans to regime-change “seven countries in five years” in the Middle East already underway in 2004 according to retired General Wesley Clark both imagined and real caliphate dovetailed nicely with US foreign policy aims of remaking the region in its image.  Meanwhile a scenario titled “Cycle of Fear” in which an “Orwellian world” arises from crippling fear of terrorism is almost a wink to the reader coming just a few short years after the September 11 attacks spawned the Patriot Act and a draconian reduction in Americans’ civil liberties. The NIC report was published years before NSA contractor Edward Snowden’s leaks began to reveal the disturbing extent of the US surveillance state and Americans in 2004 were for the most part blissfully ignorant about how much they were being spied on – but the NSA which consulted on the NIC paper certainly wasn’t. Other predictions are so obvious that holding them up as a sign of predictive genius is almost laughable. Anticipating a US confrontation with North Korea didn’t take any special skills – then-president George W. Bush had labeled the country part of the “Axis of Evil” alongside Iraq and Iran in 2002 presumably tagging it for eventual regime change. Nor did predicting China’s growth and dominance in the world economy require any great insight – it was already the second-largest global economy in 2004 with its GDP growing at over twice the rate of the US. And a warning against nation-building – a failure the US had already experienced in Afghanistan by 2004 – is hardly prescient; it simply hasn’t been heeded in the intervening 15 years. Sure the report nailed a shift in global alliances with rising economies like the BRICS countries increasingly making their presence felt on the geopolitical stage. But betting global alliances will shift within a 15-year timeframe isn't exactly clairvoyance. Unfortunately the NIC chose to end on an optimistic note coincidentally the least-likely scenario – a so-called “Pax Americana” in which Europe devastated by a series of terrorist attacks and “more unified than some of our American friends imagined” runs into the arms of the US “imploring America to get tough on terrorism.” Even looking beyond the name – “Pax” means “peace” something a nation with military bases in at least 80 countries knows little about – this hypothetical future has aged particularly badly in the era of Brexit encouraging other European countries to mull seeking independence from the union.  “Even as the existing order is threatened the United States will have many opportunities to fashion a new one” the report concludes. The stubborn optimism of the intelligence community of 2004 – just three years into what has become nearly two decades of non-stop war triggered in part by that community’s own intel failures – is much more “eerie” than any resemblance of its fortune-telling to the real world of 2020. It’s not hard to see how the slight disconnect with reality on display here mushroomed into the chasm separating today’s intelligence community from the real world. Like this story?

25,None,"Netanyahu submitted the request to Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein on Wednesday night stressing that he was not asking for ""everlasting immunity."" Earlier in a speech at Jerusalem's Orient Hotel Netanyahu clarified his intention to seek immunity saying it would only be “temporary” and last the duration of the next parliamentary session. “There is no possibility for anyone to avoid standing trial” he said. The PM added that he had never promoted or altered any law in an effort to avoid standing trial and that the immunity law exists to “protect elected officials from political lawsuits.” Netanyahu slammed the corruption charges against him as being politically motivated and pushed by people with “hidden motivations.” He said it was “very difficult” for his opponents and enemies to witness achievements under his leadership that made Israel the “eighth superpower in the world.” Netanyahu spent the remainder of his speech targeting political rivals including Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz. Neither Netanyahu or Gantz was able to form a government after elections last year. On Tuesday Israeli High Court judges rejected a petition filed by academics former defense officials and other public figures attempting to ban Netanyahu from seeking re-election due to the corruption charges leveled against him.  He is charged with bribery fraud and breach of public trust in three cases. Responding to Netanyahu's speech on Wednesday night Gantz said the PM's intention to seek immunity indicated that he was clearly guilty adding that Israel now faced a choice between “the Kingdom of Netanyahu… or the State of Israel.” Like this story?

26,None,The youths pounced on the officers dressed as Palestinian technicians hitting and pepper-spraying them after the men refused to give a clear explanation of why they were walking around the center of the West Bank settlement on Tuesday local media reported. They were subsequently taken in for questioning and their lawyer Moshe Polsky has claimed held overnight. The boys’ names were not released as they were both minors. Polsky defending the boys on behalf of right-wing legal aid group Honeinu slammed the officers for “committing provocations” during a “stressful security period.” The police declined to comment on the nature of their undercover work to the press and it’s easy to see how their presence might have raised a few eyebrows. Bat Ayin unlike many other Jewish settlements in the West Bank bars even Arab laborers from entry under a principle euphemistically called “Hebrew labor.” The attorney told a different version of events in which the disguised cops - along with other police hiding nearby - “jumped” the boys insisting the pepper-spray-wielding teen was forced to come to his friend’s aid only after he saw the other boy being attacked. Settlers are often heavily armed and anonymous residents told Arutz Sheva that the officers were lucky no armed inhabitant had passed by the confrontation. Settlement youth have been let off the hook for attacking police dressed as Palestinians before - the Jerusalem Magistrate’s Court absolved three teens from charges they had attacked disguised cops calling the officers’ actions “provocation.” Last month an unnamed security official highlighted a sharp uptick in settler violence against Palestinians near Bat Ayin over the preceding weeks telling the Times of Israel that the perpetrators were coming to the settlement from Yitzhar another recent hotspot for ethnically-motivated violence because of a military crackdown on the anti-Palestinian attacks in that area. In Bat Ayin last month two settlers were arrested for throwing rocks at a Palestinian vehicle and Palestinian bus driver was attacked while driving through the settlement in November.

27,None,Kurz and his Greens counterpart Werner Kogler announced on Wednesday that a deal had been done both seeming quite proud that they had been able to keep “key campaign promises.” “When you present the program you will see that both work – greening the tax system and reducing the tax burden” Kurz said vowing to “do everything to serve the Austrians.” “We agreed more on climate protection than we suspected” Kogler said explaining that “greening and social balance go hand in hand.” The deal still has to be approved by a majority of Greens delegates at the party’s Federal Congress on Saturday. If it passes the new government could assume power as soon as next week. The conservative People’s Party (OVP) leader entered into negotiations with the left-wing Greens in November two months after both parties made strong gains in September’s parliamentary elections. Kurz’s party was far and away the winner but their previous coalition partner – the far-right FPO – lost badly its reputation damaged after a manufactured scandal brought down its leader – and by extension the entire government – in May. The OVP and Greens had tried and failed to form a coalition before in 2003 and Kurz had warned that it would not be an easy task finding common ground between the conservative and liberal parties due to widely divergent stances on issues including immigration and economic policy. The OVP-FPO coalition government was dissolved in a vote of no confidence after a video appearing to show Kurz's FPO counterpart Heinz-Christian Strache engaging in corrupt dealings with the fake “niece” of a Russian oligarch in Ibiza in 2017 was mysteriously released just over a week before the European Parliament elections two years later. Strache has claimed the complicated scheme was designed by foreign intelligence agencies to torpedo the coalition and by extension the entire Euroskeptic right. Like this story?

28,None,Washington’s Route 240 was briefly shut down on Tuesday night due to the pileup which saw five cars and an 18-wheeler semi-truck buried under hundreds of tumbleweeds carried into the area by high winds. The roadway was closed down for several hours while Department of Transportation workers cleared away the piles. “People were still stuck at midnight and rang in the new year trapped under the weeds” Washington State Patrol trooper Chris Thorson told the Associated Press. Taking to Twitter with the hashtag #tumblegeddon on Wednesday morning Thorson shared footage of workers excavating the last remaining car from the mountain of weeds stuck there overnight – though “luckily no one was in it” the officer noted. The roads were finally cleared on New Year’s Day after some 10 hours of digging with workers employing snow plows to get the job done.

29,None,De Blasio called out the company in a tweet on Wednesday outraged about its New Year’s Eve prices for those celebrating the holiday in Times Square and encouraging New Yorkers to ditch the corporate franchise for local eateries. “Jacking up your prices on people trying to celebrate the holidays? Classy Domino's” he said. “To the thousands who came to Times Square last night to ring in 2020 I’m sorry this corporate chain exploited you – stick it to them by patronizing one of our fantastic LOCAL pizzerias.” The mayor’s broadside on Domino's was not received well on Twitter however where users piled on to demolish his “bad take” from all angles many observing that the $30 price tag is comparable to local pizza shops in Times Square. “Even at $30 its price competitive with full pies at any of those ‘local’ pizzerias near Times Square on a normal day and they have to pay delivery guys to run that pizza through a [crowd] on foot b/c people can't leave their position to go to a pizza place” one user shot back. Fox Business’s libertarian stalwart John Stossel also took a slice out of de Blasio slamming the mayor’s extravagant spending of city tax dollars while others sought to impart a lesson in basic economics. “Do you have any idea how much work/TIME it must be to find the person who ordered the pizza in that crowd?”asked YouTuber and one-time New York congressional candidate Joey Saladino. “Do you have any idea of the effect of your minimum wage increases?

30,None,Some 13 people were on board a UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter when it attempted an emergency landing on Thursday morning Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said. Rescuers were promptly sent to the area of the crash in the mountainous Wulai district in the northern part of the Chinese self-governing territory. So far several people have been found alive while three including Shen remain unaccounted for. While it’s unclear what prompted the mishap the ministry reported that the aircraft was on a mission to Yilan County in northeastern Taiwan when it went down. The incident comes as the island gears up for its presidential and vice-presidential elections set for January 11. Speaking ahead of the ballot Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen who is seeking re-election in the upcoming vote stoked tensions in what is already a very tense relationship between the island and mainland China rejecting the “one country two systems” principle as something “definitely not feasible” for Taiwan. It comes after the territory’s parliament passed a so-called “anti-infiltration bill” championed by anti-Beijing forces and aimed at curbing the Chinese government’s influence.

31,None,Speaking in the context of the recently passed Citizenship Amendment Act which fast-tracks Indian citizenship for religious groups fleeing persecution in Afghanistan Pakistan and Bangladesh Reddy said India must pick up the slack for other nations unwilling to take in poor refugees singling out Italy by name. “It's our moral responsibility to give citizenship to the minorities [from three neighboring Muslim countries]” Reddy said. “If they don't come to India where will they go? To Italy?” The citizenship act has courted controversy and sparked nationwide protests with opponents arguing it discriminates against Muslims who were left off the list of groups eligible for expedited citizenship. Supporters of the bill have defended the exemption however arguing the three neighboring countries are predominately Muslim and that the bill is designed to protect vulnerable minorities. Since the Mediterranean migrant crisis broke out in the 2010s Italy has been among the least willing to open its doors to refugees many of whom are fleeing violence and various forms of persecution in Africa. During his tenure in office the country’s recently replaced Interior Minister Matteo Salvini – who also heads up the right-populist Lega Nord party – helped to drive an anti-immigration policy agenda. In 2018 a measure dubbed the “Salvini decree” was signed into law scrapping a number of legal protections for migrants and streamlining the deportation process. Though the decree and other similar acts appear to have had some effect – with Italy taking in about half the number of refugees in 2019 that it did in the previous year – Salvini’s replacement Luciana Lamorgese has indicated a much less hawkish stance on the migrant question. In an interview with La Repubblica in November she denied that Italy was “facing any invasion” – a term Salvini and like-minded lawmakers have used to describe the large influx of refugees into Europe.

32,None,Some 16 of the drones have been seen across northeast Colorado in recent weeks sheriff's departments in two Colorado counties have confirmed. Though the aircraft have not violated any federal guidelines for flying Yuma County Sheriff Todd Combs said they’ve nonetheless left residents “very nervous and anxious.” “People do not like the unknown as it upsets the balance of our lives” Combs wrote in a lengthy Facebook post on Tuesday noting that there were “many theories about what is going on” but no definitive explanation. “I think we are all feeling a little bit vulnerable due to the intrusion of our privacy that we enjoy in our rural community but I don't have a solution or know of one right now. All I can say is don't live your life in the fear of the unknown” the sheriff continued. Most of the drones – unarmed and generally non-threatening – have been seen flying in low-altitude “Class G” airspace which under federal regulations gives a wide berth for small private aircraft to “operate as they see fit” Combs said. Both the FAA and the US Army also deny that the craft are theirs according to the Denver Post though the Pentagon and Air Force did not respond to a request for comment. Beyond that little else is known. Several divisions of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are now looking into the drones seen flying over both states FAA spokesman Ian Gregor told CNN. An FAA investigator is also scheduled to meet with Combs’ department next week to get to the bottom of the mystery. Colorado Senator Cory Gardner also said he was keeping watch over the situation tweeting on Tuesday that he had been in contact with FAA officials. In the meantime Combs said: “I would like to reassure you I am doing the best to get you answers” also warning residents to refrain from attempting to shoot down the craft while they investigate. Some have taken to Twitter to suggest ways to bring the drones down but authorities warn their batteries could ignite fires on the ground. The strange phenomenon comes as the FAA seeks to introduce a new rule requiring most drones to be equipped with remote ID technology which the agency says will “enhance safety and security by allowing the FAA law enforcement and Federal security agencies to identify drones flying in their jurisdiction.” A fairly new but rapidly developing technology there are now some 1.5 million drones and around 160000 remote pilots registered with the FAA.

37,None,At least 18 people have died throughout the current bushfire season in Australia. Eight of the victims perished in the country’s southeast on New Year's Eve while 17 people remain unaccounted-for in Victoria State.  New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian has declared a seven-day state of emergency and the fire service have created a roughly 200km-long “tourist leave zone.” “We don’t take these decisions lightly but we also want to make sure we’re taking every single precaution to be prepared for what could be a horrible day on Saturday” Berejiklian said. Another heatwave is expected to hit the beleaguered country at the weekend with gusting winds and temperatures expected to hit 40 degrees Celsius in parts. These conditions have prompted the urgent need to evacuate the roughly 3000 tourists and 1000 locals stuck in Mallacoota Victoria. The 1000-person capacity ship HMAS Choules is anchored about 1.5 kilometres off Mallacoota Thursday morning and will set sail for an undisclosed Victorian port on Friday morning with an estimated 800 evacuees on board. “We’re looking to put 1000 on the ship. If the number is less than 1000 then clearly everyone is going to go in that first boat” HMAS Choules' Commander Scott Houlihan said.  “If the number is greater than 1000 then it’s going to be a second load. It’s 16-17 hours to the closest boat port then we’ve got to come back.” The multi-role aviation training vessel MV Sycamore will also assist in the relief operation in what New South Wales’ Transport Minister Andrew Constance called the “largest evacuation of people out of the region ever.” Weather permitting evacuations will also be carried out by air if and when the thick acrid smoke clears; children the sick and elderly will be given priority. This season’s bushfires have scorched over 5.5 million hectares (13.5 million acres) across the country greater than the land mass of Denmark or the Netherlands and the impending heatwave looks set to exacerbate an already dire situation. “The message is we’ve got so much fire in that area we have no capacity to contain these fires” New South Wales Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said.

He fled the country days ago after being put under house arrest. Many details of Ghosn's sudden escape are still unclear but it is believed he traveled to Lebanon on a private jet and a private security company may have been involved in getting him out of Japan.

According to NHK Ghosn managed to board a flight with a spare French passport. The businessman denies all allegations against him. Upon landing in Lebanon which does not have an extradition treaty with Japan Ghosn said he has no faith in the “rigged Japanese justice system” and accused the authorities in Tokyo of not respecting his rights.   French State Secretary for Economy and Finance Agnes Pannier-Runacher told BFM TV that Paris would not have extradited Ghosn if he had arrived in the country because “France never extradites its nationals.” Think your friends would be interested?

41,None,The thought of going back to work after a festive season dominated by too much food drink and average films on TV can be unappetizing for many around the world but Brits seem to have taken it to another level going by their social media feeds. #backtowork was trending on Twitter on Thursday with an avalanche of humorous gifs and memes as workers in the UK expressed their horror at having to function at the start of 2020. One seemingly dazed and confused person tweeted an apology for being late to work insisting that “I got up on time had a shower and then accidentally sat down on my bed and stared into space for 30 minutes.”  Gifs showing a disgruntled child and a perplexed former US President Barack Obama were also in supply as well as funny memes illustrating helpful guides to what to expect on their first day back in the workplace. There were even poems penned such as one called ‘New Year Office Chit-chat.’ It comes after new research revealed people suffering from ‘back-to-work’ stress may be suffering from alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Dr Mark Wright a consultant in liver medicine at University Hospital Southampton (UHS) warned that many will put feelings of nausea shaking and general irritability down to “work dread” as the festive season comes to an end. While many across the UK were struggling to ease back into the daily grind on Thursday people in Scotland were relishing yet another public holiday.  Think your friends would be interested?

42,None,In a subversive twist on normality the British Army is making use of this modern social mindset for a new recruitment campaign to get such stereotypes “to join its ranks.” The campaign is being rolled out this week on Twitter Facebook and mainstream media. In one of the ads aimed at young women the image shows a jigsaw of toned physiques and implies that make-up fake tan and lip fillers only present a temporary fix to gain confidence. Critics online however question the authenticity of the ad and ask if promoting the army to the ‘body beautiful’ and potentially vacuous snowflake generation is the best way to gain army recruits. Nick Terry who works for Capita developed the ‘Army Confidence Lasts A Lifetime’ recruitment campaign and said the creatives devised the ad for young people who normally wouldn’t “see the army as their first port of call.” He added: “The recruitment campaign evolves each year and we are looking to build on the success of last year where applications reached a five-year high and 1.5 million people visited the recruitment website in January alone. We had to go with a slightly different message. They needed a bit more persuading and convincing that the army was right for them.” According to research conducted by The Prince’s Trust and Deloitte 54 per cent of 16-to-24-year-olds lack self-esteem and 46 per cent feel inadequate. So is joining the military one way to combat the zeitgeist epidemic of body-dysmorphia-meets-social-media shallowness? The British army is currently facing a long-term decline in numbers with almost 8500 vacant positions. But do those who support an ego-centric lifestyle have the country’s best interest at heart? Defence Secretary Ben Wallace believes that a career in the army can be an ideal step for many young people: “The latest Army recruitment campaign reflects these unique opportunities and I hope it will build on the success of last year’s campaign which led to a record number of applications in recent years.” Whether becoming soldiers will give selfie lovers a narrative is debatable but for those simply wanting to lose weight and get fitter senior officers have also revealed that the army will be running a four-week boot camp for those who fail to meet the selection guidelines. Let’s hope every army-worthy snowflake’s dry January and radical new diets for 2020 are doing well. Think your friends would be interested?

43,None,Pope Francis would clearly have rathered a different end to 2019 but was instead embroiled in a controversy albeit minor on December 31 when he appeared to slap away a rather overly enthusiastic fan something for which he later apologized. Salvini posted his own parody version of the incident on his social media channels which has been viewed over 600000 on Instagram alone.  The former Italian minister of the interior appears walking nonchalantly before being accosted by an adoring but “agitated fan” (his girlfriend Francesca Verdini). He draws back as if to strike her before gently caressing her cheek instead as the pair burst out laughing. Without mentioning Francis by name Salvini was clearly making light of the much-discussed incident in St Peter’s Square.  “So many times we lose patience. It happens to me too. I apologize for the bad example given yesterday” the Pope said before giving his traditional prayer from the Apostolic Palace in the iconic Vatican square. Like this story?

44,None,"Lawmakers approved the motion which grants a one-year mandate for the troop deployment in an emergency session on Thursday. The motion passed by 325 votes to 184. The plan was opposed by Turkey's main opposition party the Republican Peoples’ Party (CHP) which said sending troops could aggravate the situation and embroil Ankara in another conflict. The CHP said Monday that it didn't want to see a situation similar to the crisis in Syria ""unfold in yet another country."" The motion does not clarify how big the deployment would be or when troops would be sent allowing for the government to decide on the details. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said Wednesday that the deployment would likely start with military advisers drones and special operations and that the ""hope"" would be that the military itself would not need to be involved. Oktay said Turkey would not need to send troops if the rival government led by Gen Khalifa Haftar halted its offensive and had a ""different attitude."" Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in December that Libyan prime minister Fayez al-Sarraj had asked for Ankara to send troops to the war-torn country when the two signed a military support pact. He insisted the deployment will allow Turkey to safeguard its interests in Libya and the wider region. Less than an hour after the adoption of the bill the Turkish president's office said Erdogan discussed Libya with his US counterpart Donald Trump. The two leaders “stressed the importance of diplomacy in resolving regional issues” yet it remained unclear whether Washington endorsed Ankara’s decision or opposed it. Egypt for its part made its position very clear condemning Turkey’s move and warning that it might “negatively affect the stability of the Mediterranean region.” Cairo has also urged the international community to address Ankara’s endeavor as soon as possible. Libya has been locked in a never-ending civil conflict since 2011 when NATO’s bombing campaign helped anti-government militants to oust the long-time leader of the country Muammar Gaddafi. The international intervention helped the “democratic” uprising to succeed – Gaddafi was gruesomely murdered and the country was effectively destroyed as a state. As of now there are two main warring parties in Libya – the UN-backed Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) and the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR) propped by the so-called Libyan National Army (LNA) led by strongman Khalifa Haftar. The two forces have been entangled in a bloody conflict for years already yet the standoff became particularly heated early in 2019 when the LNA launched a massive assault against the GNA and reached the outskirts of Tripoli. The offensive however promptly lost its momentum resulting in a stalemate – but in mid-December Haftar announced a new push on Tripoli and intense fighting resumed.

45,None,Thursday’s strike action saw protesters block two bus depots in Paris. Officers dispatched to the protest were filmed spraying what some described as tear gas directly into the faces of some of the demonstrators.   Tear gas was also reportedly used by police on the streets of the city center where protesters marched on Thursday some bearing brightly-burning flares and there were several arrests as riot police and demonstrators clashed.  Unions began protesting against the pension reform proposals on December 5 2019 and warned the strikes which have seriously impacted on the country’s transport services would continue into the new year unless the Macron government took their concerns about the pension system changes on board. The previous record for the longest continuous strike in France was 28 days set by rail workers in 1968. Think your friends would be interested?

46,None,The court ruled in favor of Puigdemont and another pro-independence politician Toni Comin who served as health minister in the exiled leader’s former government. Both politicians are now residing in Belgium and are wanted in Spain on charges of sedition over their role in organizing a banned Catalonia independence referendum in 2017. The two were still elected to the European Parliament in May as representatives of the Catalan parties. In late December the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that Puigdemont and Comin should be allowed to sit as MEPs and that Madrid had no right to block them. Just days after the ruling Madrid prosecutors asked a Spanish judge to maintain the international arrest warrants for both politicians. In his latest tweet Puigdemont called for the release of another pro-independence leader Oriol Junqueras who was sentenced to 13 years in jail for his role in the attempted secession. “Spain must act in the same way as Belgium has done and respect the law” the former Catalan president said pointing to the fact that Junqueras was an MEP as well. Catalan independence remains a hot topic in the region more than two years after the referendum was shut down by a heavy-handed police operation. Both secessionists and unionists have repeatedly hit the streets in massive demonstrations throughout the region ever since. Most recently thousands of protesters demanding self-determination and the release of imprisoned Catalan leaders took to the streets of Barcelona following a highly anticipated El Clasico match in La Liga on December 18. The protest ended up in clashes between the demonstrators and riot police. Think your friends would be interested?

47,None,Two large glowing orbs appeared to be flanking the Sun on either side dwarfing our star in the process on the last day of 2019 in the skies above the country’s northeastern Jilin Province. These “artificial suns” hung in the sky for roughly 20 minutes before disappearing. Now given that the Sun provides plenty of light and heat for our planet on its own how could it be that we didn’t all burn up in a fiery apocalypse if two additional suns suddenly burst into the sky? It turns out the ‘extra’ suns were actually caused by an atmospheric optical phenomenon known as a sun dog formally referred to as a parhelion. A sun dog is caused by the refraction of sunlight by ice crystals in Earth’s atmosphere which usually create glowing orbs in the sky roughly 22 degrees to left and right of the sun at the same altitude above the horizon.  The temperature needs to be quite cold roughly 20 degrees below zero Celsius when the Sun is still quite low in the sky for the spectacular if mildly terrifying phenomenon to occur.

48,None,The controversial presentation took place in early December when the primary school in Labunia was bestowed with the honorary title of the Children of the Zamosc. The name refers to thousands of Polish children who had been rounded up and deported by the occupying Nazi forces as part of an ethnic-cleansing campaign. Zamosc the city northwest of the Labunia commune was the focus of the mass deportations and became the namesake for the tragedy. To mark the honor bestowed on it the school held a ceremony inviting various officials surviving veterans serving members of the military and police force and other guests. School students some of them as young as seven gave a dance performance in a symbolic re-enactment of what happened during the Second World War. Details of the Zamosc presentation became national news and a scandal after they were reported by the Polish edition of Newsweek magazine. Critics say the school had gone too far when it decided to dress young kids in the uniforms of the brutal Nazi secret police (the Gestapo which had been in charge of the wartime operation) and death-camp robes and to even stage what appears to be a mass execution. Among the voices blasting the scenography was that of the Auschwitz memorial which said there were better ways to educate young children about the horrors of the Nazi crimes. “The adults who organized this lack in elementary sensitivity” it said in a tweet. Some 232000 children were murdered at the Auschwitz death camp including about 3000 ethnic Poles. Part of the anger is probably directed not at the poor artistic taste but rather the speeches that were delivered during the naming ceremony. According to Newsweek some of the speakers told children that Poland was still owed reparations from Germany while the head of Labunia warned them that left-wing politicians wanted to eradicate God from the national culture. A Polish NGO apparently was so offended that it intends to file a complaint about public incitement of violence against leftists. Facing the criticism the school has since deleted photos of the performance from its webpage. Footage and pictures are still widely available in the Polish media however.

49,None,"The ‘red’ notice calls on authorities in Lebanon to arrest Ghosn who managed to jump bail in Japan where he is charged with embezzlement and to flee to the middle-eastern country.  Interpol’s request was received by Lebanon’s internal security forces but it has yet to be referred to the judiciary a Lebanese judicial source told Reuters. The source told the news agency that in past cases where Lebanon has received red notices for Lebanese citizens resident in the country the suspects were not been detained but their passports were confiscated and a bail bond set. Ghosn fled Japan days ago by hiding in the case of a musical instrument after having been put under house arrest in that country.  Many details of his daring escape remain unclear but it is believed he traveled to Lebanon on a private jet and a private security company may have been involved in getting him out of Japan.

50,None,PM Scott Morrison visited the town of Cobargo on Thursday apparently looking for a PR opportunity – that actually turned into a disaster for him. The fires devastated the township on Tuesday – at least three people were killed while scores lost their homes and businesses. READ MORE: Australian air force navy preparing for ‘largest ever evacuation' of people from fire-ravaged Victoria (PHOTOS VIDEOS) The official started his visit to Cobargo walking up to a local woman casually asking “How are you?” and then forcing her into a handshake – and that was when all the PR stunt flopped. “I’m only shaking your hand if you give more funding to our RFS [Rural Fire Service]” the visibly reluctant woman told the PM. Morrison was promptly swarmed by locals afterwards who asked him a bunch of quite reasonable questions about very low number of fire engines that responded to the fires lack of relief and so on – that he did not answer however. The PM aimlessly roamed the street with a bunch of other officials including the natural disasters minister David Littleproud – and their silence only angered the locals further. One man urged the official to get out of town telling him that his electoral prospects now look quite bleak in a profanity-laden rant. “You’re an idiot mate. You really are. You won’t be getting any votes down here buddy… No liberal votes. You’re out son. You are out. Goodnight Vienna. Bye. Go on p**s off.” Pelted with further questions about those who died in the fires and the many who've lost their homes the officials ultimately retreated to their car – without so much as a goodbye. Australia has been plagued by the bushfires that affected each of its states since the end of October. Extreme heat and high winds make the situation even more complicated with new blazes sparking almost daily. So far the fires have devastated more than four million hectares (10 million acres) of land. , https://www.rt.com/news/477325-australia-pm-bushfire-victims/,0.8103578413284466
51,None,A petition signed by 67 former government officials asked the court to rule that Netanyahu would not be fit for forming a new government due to his being prosecuted. The court ruled that it indeed had the power to rule on the matter contrary to claims from the Likud party’s lawyers but refused to do so before the outcome of the election is clear. It clears the way for Netanyahu to run in the snap election but his theoretical premiership remains in question. The court pointed out that even if Likud wins the mandate to form the next Israeli government its incumbent leader may not be the person who would be tasked with the job. Netanyahu is currently seeking immunity from prosecution which may be given him by the Knesset. However even some of his allies in the previous snap election said they were not willing to grant this to him. Like this story?

52,None,"Esper said he expects more “provocative behavior” by “Iran-backed” groups – and warned that “they will likely regret it.” “They’ve been…attacking our bases for months now” Esper claimed apparently pinning every rocket attack on a coalition base in recent months on Iran. He called on Iraq to “do more…to address these Iran-sponsored militia groups and to stop their attacks on US and coalition forces” complaining the US has not “seen sufficient action on that front” from Baghdad. The Trump administration blamed Tuesday’s siege of the US embassy in Baghdad on Tehran and sent 750 troops to Iraq in order to beef up security at the diplomatic compound. Iran President Donald Trump has said will be held ""fully responsible for lives lost or damage incurred at any of our facilities."" However the protesters who surrounded the embassy were motivated by rage over US strikes that killed 25 members of Kataib Hezbollah part of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) and officially part of the Iraqi military. Tehran meanwhile has accused the US of punishing it for defeating Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists. It slammed the “audacity” of Washington fobbing responsibility for the protests off on Iran when US airstrikes – supposedly in response for an attack on a coalition base near Kirkuk – had actually motivated the embassy-storming. The Trump administration’s rhetoric regarding Iran may trigger deja vu for those who remember the most recent Iraq War with its talk of pre-emptive strikes against leader Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi leader was said to be sitting on a cache of weapons of mass destruction and had to be stopped before he could use them. Now known to be a complete fiction the “weapons of mass destruction” trope has been recycled in the Trump administration’s sanctions on Iran deeming the country’s largest airline a “weapons of mass destruction proliferator.”  The US could send still more forces to the Middle East Esper said pledging to “take it day by day.”“A variety of forces” are standing by in case they are needed Joint Staff General Mark Milley said.

53,None,Shaun Sawyer chief constable of Devon and Cornwall Police and the UK lead on slavery and human trafficking said drug gangs exploit the space between “the school gate and the front door” which he described as a vacuum left in the wake of government cuts for child services and increased austerity measures under the Conservative government.  “More police officers will make a dent but it won’t stop the causes. One of the solutions to the causes is the gap between the dysfunctional home and the school” Sawyer said.  The UK has seen a 74 percent rise in exploitation of majority-British-national children reaching some 726 people in 2019. At least 638 children under 18 claimed to have suffered criminal exploitation in three months mostly related to the illegal drug trade which uses children as drug mules and debt collectors especially in smaller rural communities far from their own homes.  There were a reported 1739 live modern slavery operations in Britain encompassing figures for both children and adults compared with a reported 180 operations in January 2016.  “For these children they are almost back to Victorian times and are being criminally exploited. These kids are looking for family and security” Sawyer added decrying the sharp increase in the number of child grooming victims over the last five years and citing a lack of youth facilities and school exclusions.  There were approximately 18700 suspected child grooming victims in 2018-19 up from some 3300 just five years ago.  “For understandable reasons of austerity state youth services have been vacated. This gap of youth provision between the school and family is the void that the exploiters are filling.” Sawyer also warned against gender bias in law enforcement and urged seeing boys as victims of the same exploitation.  “We accept that a 14-year-old girl does not make a choice to sleep with multiple men. I don’t think it is an informed choice to choose repeatedly to steal or deal drugs and then hand over the profits” Sawyer concluded. “We’ve learned that girls who are exploited can be victims but we seem unable or unwilling to learn the same lessons for boys where criminal exploitation is concerned.” Think your friends would be interested?

54,None,Castro released a video on Thursday thanking his supporters and promising to “keep fighting for an America where everyone counts.” Touting his record of “speaking up for the most vulnerable folks in this country” the former San Antonio mayor boasted of “shaping the conversation” in the 2020 race but admitted that he had realized “it simply isn’t our time” with just a month to go before the caucuses in Iowa. Castro made waves by promising on the debate stage to decriminalize illegal border crossings leading many other candidates to adopt that position – unpopular as it may be among voters. A third-generation immigrant he entered the presidential race almost exactly a year ago holding up his success – first mayor of a large Texas city then secretary of Housing and Urban Development under then-President Barack Obama – as proof of “what is possible when this country gets it right.” However he was not able to distinguish himself in fundraising or poll numbers struggling to crack one percent for most of the race (though some polls put him as high as 4 percent). He nearly ended his campaign in October getting in just under the wire with the $800000 his campaign needed to go forward. Castro has blamed the primary schedule in which largely-white states like Iowa and New Hampshire vote first for potentially skewing results claiming they do not represent the country’s true demographics. Castro’s departure leaves the still-crowded Democratic field with 14 candidates with another 12 – many of whom voters would not even recognize – having dropped out. Some have speculated that Castro who reportedly made the shortlist to be Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential pick in 2016 could end up back in the race as another candidate’s VP.

55,None,Speaking at a rally on Thursday the leader did not mince his words for the opposition or for his country’s ach-rival Pakistan and vigorously defended the new law. Modi flatly accused India’s main opposition party –the Indian National Congress (INC)– of attacking the country’s legislature and vulnerable refugees urging it to find a target for criticism elsewhere. “Pakistan was formed on the basis of religion and minorities were being persecuted there. The persecuted were forced to come to India as refugees. But [the INC] and its allies don’t speak against Pakistan instead they are taking out rallies against these refugees” Modi said. The new law in India officially known as the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) has been among the hottest issues in the country over the past few weeks. The legislation facilitates accession to Indian citizenship for the people who immigrated into the country from the three neighboring Muslim-majority states – Pakistan Afghanistan and Bangladesh – fleeing alleged religious persecution. The simplified procedure however does not extend to Muslim migrants from these countries. The CAA’s critics claimed that the legislation is discriminatory and “anti-Muslim” in its essence. Its adoption sparked mass protests across the country bringing both India’s Muslims and critics of the Modi government’s policies onto the streets. The handling of the protests by the authorities has somewhat fueled the unrest further – a massive police raid on New Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia University’s campus for instance stirred up students’ dissent countrywide. The law also drew some international criticism with Pakistan being particularly vocal about it. The country’s top officials including PM Imran Khan condemned the policies of New Delhi warning that adoption of the CAA – as well as India’s handling of the disputed region of Kashmir – might cause a mass exodus of Muslims creating a new refugee crisis that the world hasn’t witnessed before. Meanwhile Modi has said he is perplexed as to how the law designed to help vulnerable groups of people could be so blatantly misinterpreted as discriminatory. Think your friends would be interested?

56,None,"Box-ticking is a number one priority for Marvel’s upcoming Phase Four films. Having already confirmed gay and deaf characters in ‘The Eternals’ Marvel President Kevin Feige promised that a transgender character will be introduced into the fictional world “very soon.” Asked at the New York Film Academy about transgender representation in the franchise that kicked off in 2008 with ‘Iron Man’ Feige responded that a film “shooting right now” would feature a transgender character. This would suggest that ‘The Eternals’ due out in November is the film in question since it is currently being filmed.  However there have also been reports that Marvel is seeking to cast a transgender actor in ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’ which is set to be released next year. ‘The Eternals’ follows a group of immortal creatures who live on Earth and help to shape civilizations. It will star actors like Angelina Jolie and Kit Harrington. Feige has already confirmed a gay character will be included in the film. “He’s married he’s got a family and that is just part of who he is” Feige told ‘Good Morning America’ about the character. While there’s absolutely nothing wrong with having transgender or gay characters in stories having those labels be the starting point and central driving force for characters is not sitting well with the non-‘woke’ crowds out there.  “I'm a Big BIG fan of [Marvel] - the comics and the movies - but it's this s**t which has caused the slump in comic sales and this WILL cause an end to their movies being hits!” wrote one Twitter user in reaction. “This will bomb worse than ‘Cats'’’ wrote another. Meanwhile others have criticized the studio from the opposite end by saying that Marvel is not going woke enough. They have speculated that the characters Feige is touting will be nonessential to the plot. This criticism is likely based on the fact that director JJ Abrams bragged about having gay representation in ‘The Rise of Skywalker’ only to have the representation end up being a kiss in a mass celebration scene. Far from the gay love story between main characters Poe and Finn that actor Oscar Isaac wanted. “I am so sick of Marvel and Disney and fake representation of LGBT characters"" one Twitter user wrote. ""This will be a background character that appears for 5 seconds and is easily cut out of the movie.

57,None,Several early risers walking on beaches in the city of Fort Pierce were stunned to see an unexplained object streak across the sky in the moments before sunrise on Wednesday. As well as a fiery trail the peculiar object also left a raft of questions in its wake as eyewitnesses struggled to comprehend what they had seen. “I knew what I was looking at was either a missile or a rocket” witness John Simard told local news outlet WPTV. “What I couldn’t understand was why was I seeing it in that area because there’s no launchpads out in the ocean.” Simard who was at the beach to photograph the first sunrise of the new year shared footage of the strange occurrence on Facebook asking his followers if they had ever seen a rocket that wasn’t moving? “If that’s a rocket it’s the world’s slowest moving rocket. It’s a dang UFO is what it is” he said. However Sanford Manley a former historian with the US Strategic Air Command poured cold water on Simard’s theory claiming that what people actually saw was the contrail of a plane being illuminated by the rising sun. “The plane is very high catching the sunlight before the sun has come up therefore it's glowing red” Manley said. He explained that the phenomenon typically occurs more often during sunsets than sunrises. After Simard appeared on local news stations his daughter Melissa Krystal Simard said that Facebook is “fact checking” his photos.  “We think the government is on to him” she joked. “Shit is crazy!

58,None,The Delhi Metro is a massive urban transport system spanning 325 kilometers and linking the Indian capital to its satellite towns. The sheer size of the transport network used by almost three million commuters every day sets it firmly among the largest metro systems in the world including those in London Shanghai Beijing and New York. Now with the help of Russian telecoms expertise the city’s underground network has also joined the ranks of metro systems offering free Wi-Fi to its passengers. It’s on just one line so far the link from the city’s commercial district to Indira Gandhi International Airport. The Wi-Fi service the first of its kind in south Asia was launched on Thursday by Delhi Metro Managing Director Mangu Singh. Russian firm MaximaTelecom was the project’s primary contractor and technology provider although the internet facilities themselves were built by a number of Indian companies. MaximaTelecom has notable experience in developing such networks having already built similar Wi-Fi systems for both the Moscow and St Petersburg metros. It also launched free Wi-Fi at almost 60 metro stations in Delhi in late 2018. Launching free Wi-Fi on one line of the New Delhi subway seems an ideal first step in the telecom company’s ambitious plans in India. The company has already announced its aim to expand the project to two more lines in the near future providing half of all commuters using the city’s metro with high-speed Wi-Fi.

59,None,Clinton said it was a “great privilege” to become the university’s 11th chancellor after her appointment was announced on Thursday. While the position does not involve relocating to Belfast – sorry Americans – the chancellor acts as an ambassador outside Northern Ireland and sometimes oversees graduation ceremonies in addition to advising the vice-chancellor and senior management.  The two-time presidential candidate received an honorary degree from the school in 2018 and has something of a history with Northern Ireland visiting with then-president Bill Clinton when he became the first serving US leader to travel there in 1995 and returning many times over the intervening years. The Clintons also have a home in the Republic of Ireland. Many on social media seemed to think she would be moving to Belfast to assume the five-year position and (erroneously) celebrated. Others wondered at the effect she would have on the students and the region which is part of the United Kingdom. A few grumbled that she still hasn’t paid for her crimes despite the chant of “lock her up” popular at Trump campaign rallies. Meanwhile Clinton supporters gloated and referenced the ill-fated Trump University – as if Clinton had had any role in founding or funding Queen’s. Clinton claims to be facing “enormous pressure” to enter the 2020 presidential race with her supporters envisioning it as a rematch against President Donald Trump. Since losing in 2016 Clinton has spent most of her media appearances attempting to delegitimize her opponent blaming his victory on everything from Russia to former FBI Director James Comey to her Democratic primary opponent Bernie Sanders who is running again in 2020. Clinton’s university position is not expected to impede a third presidential run that many including former Trump campaign director Steve Bannon believe is imminent.

61,None,"The new year barely begun President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fast-tracked a motion to approve the potential deployment of Turkish troops which passed handily in parliament on Thursday.  Erdogan’s move follows a pattern of recent muscle-flexing and is an obvious play to force Ankara into a more influential position. This is a gamble that could backfire. Ravaged by years of conflict perhaps the last thing Libya needs is another foreign power sending its troops into an already desperate situation – but Erdogan hasn’t hidden his desire to make Turkey a “top ten” world power and if it takes a military campaign in North Africa to do it perhaps he thinks it’s worth the risks. The vote to clear the way for a deployment of troops follows a military cooperation deal signed in November between Ankara and the UN-recognized government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. Sarraj has been locked in a bloody civil war with the rival government of General Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army to the east – the debacle is a direct result of NATO’s 2011 ‘humanitarian’ intervention which saw Western powers back anti-government militants in ousting and murdering PM Muammar Gaddafi leaving the country ripe for plunder and with a power vacuum needing to be filled. Yet Erdogan is putting all his eggs in one basket with Libya hoping that if Sarraj’s government in Tripoli eventually wins the civil war (and he seems to believe Turkey can help tip the balance there) Ankara will be rewarded with extended influence in the Mediterranean.  The tricky thing for Ankara is that with its oversized ambitions it threatens to alienate itself from its burgeoning relationship with Moscow – recently strengthened by the purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defense systems much to the annoyance of Ankara’s NATO partners. Russia which has been reticent about side-taking in Libya and calling for dialogue said last week it was “unlikely” that interference from third parties in Libya would lead to a settlement.  This all at a time when Erdogan has few solid friends to turn to as his relationship with Washington teeters on rocky ground following Turkey’s sudden October incursion into northern Syria against the Kurds (a move which the US was most decidedly“not happy” with). It’s not just Russia and the US who Ankara will be irking with this latest power play either. Erdogan’s deal with Sarraj which also aims to create an exclusive economic zone from southern Turkey to Libya's north east also angered Cyprus and Greece who complain that it violates the international law of the sea.  Erdogan has long harbored grand ambitions for Turkey repeating regularly that the world is “bigger than five” – a reference to the five members of the UN Security Council. The Libya crisis is seen as an opportunity by which he can force Turkey into the club (or at least be taken more seriously by it) – but he’s not the only outside player in the game. Haftar reportedly promised last week that his LNA forces would take Tripoli ""in hours"" if Egypt sent troops to help. With Haftar already receiving material support from France Egypt Jordan the United Arab Emirates (and allegedly from Russia too) Erdogan may get himself in over his head and find Turkey increasingly isolated. In his Libya gamble the risks may be greater than the rewards. Like this story? Share it with a friend! ", https://www.rt.com/news/477343-turkey-libya-erdogan-imperial-ambitions/,0.810333875747454
62,None,During the phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday “President Trump pointed out that foreign interference is complicating the situation in Libya” the White House said in a statement.  No further details were given but the call took place just after the Turkish legislature voted 325 to 184 to approve sending troops to the North African country  in order to prop up Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj and his Government of National Accord (GNA). Though the GNA is the internationally recognized government of Libya most of the country is actually controlled by a rival government in Tobruk and troops of the Libyan National Army (LNA) loyal to General Khalifa Haftar. The GNA has been reduced to the area around the capital Tripoli which the LNA has sought to capture since April 2019. Readout of the call given by Erdogan’s cabinet merely said the two leaders had “stressed the importance of diplomacy in resolving regional issues” without making it clear whether Washington endorsed Ankara’s decision or opposed it. Erdogan’s bid to back Tripoli against Tobruk resembles his power play in northern Syria in October in that it is apparently unilateral and neither coordinated nor cleared with its NATO allies. One major distinction is that the Syrian incursion was aimed against the legitimate government in Damascus as well as the US-backed Kurdish militias.  Trump advising against “foreign interference” is of course ironic on a whole different scale given the US assertion of a free hand to intervene anywhere anytime against anyone – from illegally keeping troops in Iraq and Syria to launching a regime-change operation in Libya itself back in 2011. At the time NATO bombers provided cover for militants to overthrow the government of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and plunge Libya into a chaos from which it has yet to recover.

63,None,The network coined the euphemism “civic sparring” to describe the often-heated conflicts that take place in the suburbs of New York City when Hasidic Jewish communities – often insular with large numbers of children and wary of outsiders – begin expanding sometimes at the expense of families already living in the area who may lose control of local government and schools. NBC didn’t stop at coining the cringeworthy term however. It suggested “some fear the recent violence” – a mass stabbing at a Hanukkah celebration inside a rabbi’s home in Monsey New York; a shooting that killed three in a Jersey City kosher market; a recent spate of street attacks in New York City – “may be an outgrowth of that conflict” in a since-deleted tweet on Thursday.  Many accused the network of victim-blaming comparing it to other popular blame-transfer mechanisms favored by MSM. “Her dress was too short” one user snarked. “Or too long in this case” another commented slyly referencing Hasidic dress which outfits women in full-length skirts and other ultra-modest looks.   “Civic sparring” joins an ever-growing sea of mainstream media euphemisms devised to insulate readers and reporters both from uncomfortable realities – in this case the idea that diversity might not always be our strength and that communities with dramatically different values might not do well living on top of each other. After drowning in angry replies NBC removed the “civic sparring” tweet regretting the “error” and promising another non-offensive message to follow. Instead they placed their foot deeper in their mouth – though admittedly just tweeting the article’s headline. “Anti-Semitism grows in Jewish communities in NYC suburbs” made it sound like the Jewish communities were the ones being antisemitic. Social media had other suggestions. MSM has become notorious for whipping up euphemisms to cover up inconvenient truths whether it’s the “cultural enrichment” accompanying the crime spike in Europe or the “austere religious scholar” who led the Islamic State terror group (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) until he was blown up and given a stirring eulogy by the Washington Post. These outlets have no problem irresponsibly exaggerating some issues – “Free speech is killing us!” cried a New York Times op-ed that likened online “hate speech” to physical violence in order to demand government censorship – the latest in a long string of articles about social media supposedly turning Americans into froth-mouthed extremists. New York Magazine published “Why Migrant Detention Centers Are Concentration Camps” in June only to apparently change the name to something a bit more nuanced. These same outlets can be counted upon to either minimize – as they did upon learning that a rabidly anti-Iran cult that allegedly tortures its members has run such an effective campaign to radicalize Americans against Iran online that the president retweeted it and the State Department sank $1.5 million into an identical social media program - or completely ignore others as when the AP actually deleted an article on those same border “concentration camps” when it learned the scary statistic it found had been reached under Obama.  It may be easier (and more cathartic) to just assume that NBC is being anti-Semitic and scream at them. But the narrative management is more sophisticated. NBC certainly doesn’t hate Jews – as long as they’re playing their assigned part in the narrative. It will ignore an entire documentary exposing the Israeli lobby’s penetration into the American government (and media in what is no doubt merely a coincidence). But the rainbow of diversity dissolving into rivers of blood? They’ll pass on that one. Like this story?

64,None,If you’re an artist in modern Hollywood and you’re looking to score some easy brownie points with fellow celebrities and the mainstream entertainment press a pretty good bet is to call out Trump. It’s easy low-hanging fruit and it seems to work for C-list celebs like Alyssa Milano and Bette Midler so why not?  Howard a former child star who grew up to be a director tried for one of those Trump slams on Twitter but things did not seem to exactly go according to plan. “In the entertainment industry many who have known/worked w/ Trump think that while his reality show was fun and ran a long time he’s a self-serving dishonest morally bankrupt ego maniac who doesn’t care about anything or anyone but his Fame &amp; bank account &amp; is hustling the US” Howard tweeted after being asked why Hollywood is so consistently against the US president.  The attempt to give ‘insider’ knowledge about Trump did not go over well. Apparently the last person people want to hear preach politics is Richie from ‘Happy Days.’ Maybe the worst zinger came from Robbin Young a former Bond actress and Playmate who'd worked with Howard back in the 1980s. “Says Ron Howard my ‘Night Shift’ director who described the majority of the film industry. BTW Ron is there still rampant drug use and adultery in your film trailers and offset by film execs and cast?!” Young tweeted at Howard.  Other artists were also quick to push back against Howard’s theory about Trump. “Yea that’s why he gave it up donates his entire salary to charity and puts up getting trashed in the liberal controlled media over every petty little thing. Trump is a patriot he supports and understands the average American and he has given us the best economy of our life” actress Mindy Robinson tweeted at the director. “Nice audition Ron! We have a lot of other people in Hollywood just exactly like you that we are considering. But your seeming sincerity and your vicious hyperbole comforts us that you are TRULY 'one of us!' We'll be in touch!” quipped actor and director Nick Searcy. Others reminded 'Opie' – a name that trended on Twitter thanks to people poking fun at Howard who played the role of Opie – about some of Hollywood’s less savory types by posting pictures of the director with Harvey Weinstein the disgraced producer who has been accused of rape by numerous women.

66,None,According to Ambassador Iraj Masjedi the convoy was en route from the airport to Baghdad when it was hit by airstrikes on Friday morning. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis the second-in-command of Iraq’s Shia paramilitary Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) was killed alongside Soleimani. PMU officials earlier confirmed that several “important guests” had perished together with the militias blaming “the American and Israeli enemy” for their deaths. Masjedi said the victims’ bodies will be delivered to Iran “as soon as possible.” The umbrella group of Shia militias integrated into Iraq’s armed forces was blamed for the siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week.  Later in the day the Pentagon admitted that US President Donald Trump had ordered the killing of Soleimani “to protect US personnel abroad.” Muhammad Reza Al-Jabri director of public relations at the PMU was reportedly killed in the strike. The two vehicles were captured on video burning on the road leading to the airport. Hours after the attack the PMU confirmed the death of its PR director calling the alleged retaliatory sortie a “cowardly US bombing” according to Reuters.  The incident forced the airport into an immediate shutdown. All inbound and outbound flights have been canceled or diverted for the time being. The airport is located next to the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Center (BDSC) which is used by diplomats and intelligence operatives as well as the US-led anti-terrorist coalition forces in Iraq. The area is also home to the joint counter-terrorism center. The strikes come amid soaring tensions between Tehran and Washington over recent events in Iraq. A US air raid on an Iraqi Shia militia last weekend triggered a heated demonstration at the US embassy complex in Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone on Tuesday. Protesters smashed windows lit fires and chanted anti-American slogans. Washington insisted the raid was in retaliation for a militia rocket attack on a US base in Kirkuk and that Iran provided backing for the assault though it offered no evidence for the claim.

Earlier Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) blamed the US and Tel Aviv for Soleimani's takedown. ""The American and Israeli enemy is responsible for killing the mujahideen Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Qassem Soleimani"" said Ahmed al-Assadi a spokesman for Iraq's PMF as cited by Reuters. Al-Muhandis is the deputy chief of the PMF the umbrella group of Shia militias integrated into the Iraq’s armed forces which was blamed for the siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week. Al-Muhandis and Soleimani were apparently in a convoy traveling near the Baghdad airport when it was struck by multiple missiles. The PMF earlier confirmed the deaths of five of its members and two “guests.” Reuters reported that the Pentagon has claimed responsibility for the strike citing an unnamed US official. US Marines also reportedly captured two other influential Iraqi militia figures around the time of the strikes – Qais Khazali head of the paramilitary group Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Badr Organization leader Hadi al-Amiri – in a neighborhood of Baghdad according to Al Arabiya. While still lacking official confirmation that Washington was behind the assassinations some US lawmakers have already challenged the legality of the supposed American raid as Congress was apparently left in the dark about the mission. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) weighed in with a tweet later on Thursday sounding alarm that the unauthorized operation could kick off a “massive regional war” even though Soleimani was an “enemy of the United States.” The high-profile assassinations come as tensions soar between Tehran and Washington over recent events in Iraq.

The Pentagon said that the assassination was a response to “attacks on coalition bases in Iraq” accusing Soleimani of being the mastermind behind a recent spate of missile attacks on joint US and Iraqi military installations. In particular the Pentagon blamed Soleimani for orchestrating the December 27 rocket strike at a US base in Kirkuk that killed one American contractor. It also alleged that he “approved” a siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad that almost ended up in the compound being taken over by protesters who were furious over US strikes that killed 25 members of Kataib Hezbollah part of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) over the weekend. Washington has pinned the blame for the attacks on its embassy in Baghdad squarely on Tehran with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accusing “terrorists” and “Iranian proxies” of instigating the unrest. Tehran meanwhile has vehemently denied the accusations that it was somehow complicit in the storming of US diplomatic quarters in the heavily fortified Green Zone taking aim at Washington’s “audacity” to blame it for the outrage sparked by American airstrikes. The strikes which the US military framed as a tit-for-tat response for the Kirkuk attack drew ire not only from the Iran-backed Iraqi militias but also from the authorities in Baghdad which denounced the sorties as an ""unacceptable vicious assault."" The protests saw scores of Iraqi Shia militia members swarming the area in front of the embassy chanting “Death to America” and setting the entrance checkpoints on fire.

71,None,Former vice president and one of the top Democrat contenders in the 2020 presidential race Joe Biden called the airstrike in Iraq “a hugely escalatory move in an already dangerous region” that will likely provoke “future attacks by Iran” instead of deterring them. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said that Trump’s order to take out Soleimani was issued “without the consultation of the Congress.” She argued that the move will provoke more violence in the region saying that Washington “cannot afford to have tensions escalate to the point of no return.” Similar sentiment was voiced by Senators Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) both of whom are 2020 hopefuls. The president’s “dangerous escalation brings us closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East that could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars” Sanders said. Warren called the airstrike “reckless” stressing that “our priority must be to avoid another costly war.” Some Republicans meanwhile praised the move.

Trump famously bragged that such was his support he could literally get away with murder on the streets of NY and still be elected.  Republican Louisiana Rep. Mike Johnson shared an image of the card he received and decried the extremism of the so-called “radical left” on display. Even an erstwhile opponent of Trump Mark Zaid the attorney who represents the whistleblower in the Ukraine controversy at the heart of the impeachment hearings expressed his disgust at the cartoon saying it “absolutely crosses the line.” Others called for calm arguing that the softcore porn magazine was hardly representative of the Democratic Party platform. Meanwhile the hilarity of the situation proved too much for others who couldn’t resist the opportunity to point out how ridiculous the entire situation was. Hustler magazine confirmed the card's authenticity as the company’s official holiday card which was sent to multiple congressional offices but has so far declined to comment on the controversy.  The magazine’s founder Larry Flynt is a known critic of the US president and previously offered a $1 million reward for anyone who could provide him with compromising footage of then-candidate Donald Trump. He later took out a full-page ad in the Washington Post offering $10 million for information leading to Trump's impeachment and removal from office.  It’s not the first time an artistic portrayal of a Trump assassination has drawn controversy. A 2017 production of Julius Caesar by the Shakespeare in the Park group depicted a Trumpian 'Caesar' being repeatedly stabbed to death much to the outrage and consternation of conservatives and Trump supporters. The play went on to lose sponsors Delta Air Lines among others. Like this story? Share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/477376-hustler-trump-assassination-card/,0.8103915460929474
80,None,The Israeli leader said his country “stands with the United States in its just struggle for peace security and self-defense” accusing Soleimani of having staged and planned attacks against “American citizens and many other innocent people.” Qassem Soleimani the commander of the elite Quds Force was killed by a US airstrike outside of the Baghdad International Airport in an early Friday targeted assassination operation. Netanyahu cut short his visit to Greece and returned to Israel in response to the news. The US killing of the senior general has angered people in both Iran and Iraq. Tehran pledged to retaliate for Soleimani death while Iraqi caretaker prime minister said Washington has violated the terms under which Baghdad allows the US to station its troops on its soil. Among the dozen people killed by the US airstrike was a senior commander of the Iraqi militia backed by Iran.

81,None,Pompeo made his remarks after speaking over the phone with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and Yang Jiechi the head of the Chinese ruling Communist Party’s Foreign Affairs Commission. “The US remains committed to de-escalation” Pompeo said. A US drone strike killed Major General Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad’s airport on Friday morning. The Pentagon later revealed that the raid was personally greenlighted by US President Donald Trump. “The President's decision to remove Soleimani from the battlefield saved American lives” Pompeo told CNN. The US top diplomat added that Soleimani was “actively plotting” to “take big action… that would have put hundreds of lives at risk.” While touting the assassination of Soleimani as a preventive measure meant to stop a supposed attack on Americans the Trump administration came up short in terms of offering proof that Iran was preparing one. This follows a pattern by which Washington has justified anti-Iranian actions by reference to vague threats to American interests since May 2019 when the US ordered a build-up of its military presence in the Middle East. The US is pursuing a so-called 'maximum pressure campaign' against Iran which is supposedly aimed at forcing it to sign a deal on terms that are more favorable to American interests that those of the Obama-era agreement that restricted the Iranian nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. President Trump scrapped the deal and doubled down on economic sanctions. Soleimani was a highly popular figure in Iran and had many supporters in Iraq as well thanks to the crucial role he played in organizing Shiite militias fighting against the terrorist group Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS). Key US ally Israel has been waging an air war against Iran-backed militias in Syria for years calling them a threat to its national security. Tehran slammed the airstrike that killed Soleimani as “international terrorism.” The Iraqi authorities on whose soil Soleimani was killed blasted the raid as well. The operation was a “flagrant violation” of Iraqi sovereignty the country’s Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi said. Lebanon has also joined in the condemnation. Think your friends would be interested?

82,None,“US citizens should depart via airline while possible and failing that to other countries via land” the State Department advised. “Due to Iranian-backed militia attacks at the US Embassy compound [in Baghdad] all public consular operations are suspended until further notice.” The advisory comes in the immediate aftermath of the US assassination of Soleimani commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force along with senior leaders of the Iraqi Shia militia in an air strike near Baghdad International Airport on Friday morning. The Pentagon claims the strike was “aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington is committed to “de-escalation” following its “defensive action to eliminate Qassem Soleimani.” In a series of similarly-worded tweets Pompeo said he had spoken with Britain’s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas about the killing. Iranian officials have vowed to exact a “vigorous revenge” on the US for the death of Soleimani with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warning that “revenge awaits the criminals who have stained their hands in his blood.” The incident marks a serious escalation between the US and Iran following heightened tensions over the siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week. Protesters besieged the Green Zone site after a US air raid on an Iraqi Shia militia with Washington blaming Iran for backing the assault on the embassy. Think your friends would be interested?

83,None,The commander of the elite Quds Force was killed overnight in Baghdad International Airport alongside with several other high-ranking officials from local pro-Iranian militias. The assassination was carried out on the personal “direction” of Trump the US military has said claiming it was acting to protect America and its citizens. Soleimani was blamed for “the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members” and was accused of plotting further attacks on the US. While the killing prompted a lot of self-back-patting among top US officials over a job well done the US President himself took an apparent conciliatory tone suggesting that the attack was carried out to push Tehran into negotiations.  In a separate thread Trump praised himself for the assassination insisting that Soleimani “killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time and was plotting to kill many more” and therefore “should have been taken out many years ago.” He also claimed that the Quds Force chief was “both hated and feared” in his home country and that the Iranians “are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe.” Earlier in the day Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called the killing of Soleimani a “defensive action” and said “the US remains committed to de-escalation.”  But with the assassination having triggered massive outrage both in Iran and Iraq any gesture of outreach from the US is bound to fall flat. Tehran has called the attack an “act of international terrorism” vowing “vigorous revenge on America” for the death of Soleimani. Iraqi officials have been angered by the airstrike with PM Adil Abdul Mahdi calling it a “flagrant violation” of its sovereignty. The murder has apparently reinvigorated Iraq's efforts to get the US troops out; the two major parliamentary blocs have called for the adoption of a law mandating the withdrawal of all foreign military personnel from the country. Influential Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said the killing targeted Iraqi opposition members and extended his condolences to Tehran. He also hinted at the re-establishment of his anti-US militia known as the Mahdi Army disbanded over a decade ago urging its members to get ready to protect Iraq.

85,None,"Major-General Soleimani and the second-in-command of the Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed (along with others) in a US airstrike at Baghdad's airport on Friday morning.  The ""targeted killings"" of both men ""most likely violate international law incl[uding] human rights law"" the UN's Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Summary or Arbitrary Executions Agnes Callamard wrote on social media shortly after the attack. The human rights expert said that such an attack may have been justified to protect against ""an imminent threat to life"" or in self-defense but this ""test is unlikely to be met in these particular cases."" The Pentagon argued that the airstrikes were aimed at ""deterring future Iranian attack plans."" Callamard however dismissed this reasoning as being ""very vague"" and therefore unable to qualify as rationale to carry out targeted killings under international law. In total eight more people died along with Soleimani and al-Muhandis. The UN rapporteur stressed that such ""collateral"" damage is also unlawful. The airstrikes received praise among US President Donald Trump's allies in the Republican Party but were called reckless and escalatory by his opponents in the Democratic Party. French Secretary of State for European Affairs Amelie de Montchalin called for ""stability"" in the Middle East.

86,None,BFMTV says the incident happened around 2pm in Hautes-Bruyeres Park in Villejuif. Police confirmed that an operation was underway in the area and asked people to avoid the area. According to some reports police checked if the man was carrying any explosives but none were found at the scene.   The man reportedly attacked several people before attempting to flee the scene but was shot by police and fatally wounded. It’s not clear what his motives were or if he had any accomplices. Hay-les-Roses Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun told reporters that one person had been killed in the attack and the suspect was shot as he moved towards a nearby shopping center. Two others were injured. Secretary General of the SGP-FO Police Unit Yves Lefebvre said the officers “reacted in self-defense” in shooting the man. Think your friends would be interested?

87,None,"The outgoing leader warned on Friday that Iran and the US must de-escalate tensions otherwise the Middle East will see yet more conflict that would “bring further misery to the region 17 years on from the disastrous invasion of Iraq.” Corbyn branded the assassination of Soleimani who was regarded as the second-most powerful person in Iran after Supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei as “an extremely serious and dangerous escalation of conflict.” He called on PM Boris Johnson’s administration to attempt to put the brakes on the military actions of the United States. Earlier British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the UK government “recognized the aggressive threat posed by the Iranian Quds force led by Qassem Soleimani” but that any escalation of the conflict would be “in none of our interests.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took to social media to reveal that he and Raab had discussed the incident and claimed Britain acknowledged the aggressive threats posed by the Iranian Quds Force. ""The US remains committed to de-escalation"" Pompeo added. Soleimani was killed in a US military airstrike near Baghdad International Airport in the early hours of Friday. Ayatollah Khamenei — who warned that Iran would unleash “harsh revenge” on those responsible for the attack — has installed Brigadier General Esmail Ghaani as Soleimani’s replacement.

88,None,“Next week New Zealand will send another team of 22 firefighters and logistical support to join the rotation of more than 150 kiwis that we have had working alongside our Australian counterparts since October” Ardern wrote in a recent message about the wildfires.  “Can you please invade Australia? I for one would welcome our New Zealand overlords. Please send leadership” one concerned Aussie wrote in response. “Wish you could take Scott Morrison’s place for the next few months we need some humanity and help this is a disaster!” wrote user Charlotte Curd. Other posters echoed her sentiments asking: “Can you come be our PM please?!”  Many lauded Ardern’s kindness and compassion often juxtaposing it with Australia’s actual Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s perceived coldness and ineptitude.  “You are doing more for a country that is not even your own than our own leader is doing for us thank you” wrote one user.  “@jacindaardern is it possible to be leader of 2 nations? Asking for a mate” joked another. Eight people have died in the fires since Monday bringing the total killed in the natural disaster since July  to 16. Some 450 homes have been destroyed and hundreds have been displaced and many more forced to evacuate with help from the Australian Air Force and Navy in particular.  Ardern displayed an empathy and compassion that many felt were sorely lacking from Australia's own prime minister who has faced severe criticism for his handling of the bushfire crisis including going on vacation to Hawaii.  More recently in an apparent attempt at damage control and to foster some good PR Morrison visited some of the worst-affected communities only to engage in a series of failed handshakes and cringeworthy gaffes before being chased out of town by irate locals.

89,None,"The deadly fires show no signs of slowing with temperatures expected to reach well over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and ""extreme"" fire danger predicted for South Australia. The blaze is expected to consume the entirety of a national park in that province's Kangaroo Island and an evacuation order has been issued for over 100000 people. Meanwhile the government of New South Wales declared a state of emergency to take effect on Friday. Forecasters are predicting even worse on Saturday. ""Conditions are set to mirror or even deteriorate beyond what we saw on New Year's Eve"" the Bureau of Meteorology's Jonathan How said in a briefing warning that strong and dry winds would likely bring fires back to life in already-devastated regions. New Year's Eve saw residents of coastal communities forced to take to the water to avoid being engulfed in flames. Close to half a billion animals are believed to have been lost in the blaze according to ecologists from the University of Sydney. The koala population has been especially devastated due to their slow speeds preventing them from escaping the inferno – some 30 percent of one koala colony in the northeast is believed to have been destroyed. Entire species may have been decimated News Corp Australia reported earlier this week warning the damage will only increase as the fires having already burned an area larger than Denmark continue to grow. With over 12 million hectares destroyed the fires are so large they are capable of generating their own weather systems including lightning that can strike dry brush and seed new fires. Tens of thousands of people are being evacuated from the provinces of Victoria and New South Wales – ""the largest evacuation of people out of the region ever"" according to NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance. A ""Tourist Leave Zone"" across NSW has been established in the hopes of convincing visitors to get out before evacuation likely becomes impossible on Saturday while thousands have been evacuated on ships with the help of the Australian Navy from the coastal town of Mallacoota. Over 1300 homes have been destroyed and at least 17 deaths have been reported. While not the deadliest fire season in Australian history – yet – there are still months to go before it's over.

91,None,A series of three videos (since removed) were posted to Khan’s account on Friday with the PM claiming they showed a brutal crackdown on India’s Muslims by local police. The first video captioned “Indian police's pogrom against Muslims in UP [Uttar Pradesh]” was particularly gruesome – it showed what appeared to be riot police beating up “civilians” with sticks and shooting at them as they bled.  Eagle-eyed users promptly pointed out however that the video was not what Khan or those handling his account claimed it to be. Upon closer inspection it turned out the video was not even shot in India. Ever-vigilant online sleuths determined it showed the Bangladeshi Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) counter-terrorist police force cracking down on an Islamist group in the country’s capital city Dhaka seven years ago. It could be argued that it was relatively easy to trace back the origins of the footage since the uniforms and insignias of the RAB are visible in the video. The mix-up did not go unnoticed by the Indian part of the Twittersphere including by the country’s law enforcement as the Uttar Pradesh police soon tagged Khan in a post with a link to the original video from Bangladesh. India’s envoy to the UN Syed Akbaruddin joined in the criticism. The diplomat shared a video compilation of Khan’s posts accompanying it with the caption “Repeat Offenders” and the hashtag #oldhabitsdiehard. The video stayed on Khan’s Twitter for about an hour before it was pulled without any explanation. Two others dubbed ‘Indian Police attacking Muslims as part of Modi Govt's ethnic cleansing’ remained online for a little longer but ultimately vanished as well. One of these two clips was later traced back to a November 2019 farmers’ protests in Unnao district in Uttar Pradesh.  It was not immediately clear whether or not the third video was authentic. The incident sparked a storm of mockery and criticism from Indian netizens as they took to the social media platform to vent their anger – or amusement in some cases – over Khan’s apparent social media faux pas.  Some said he should hire a better social media team – implying that the mishap will see the current one given the boot. Think your friends would be interested?

92,None,After the strike on Baghdad airport “we are dealing with a different reality” de Blasio told a press conference on Friday admitting that “none of us know how this will play out” as it has been decades since the US confronted “the reality of a war with the government of a large country with an international terror network at its behest.” Previous terror attacks on New York he pointed out came from “non-state actors” without Iran's resources. Warning New Yorkers to maintain “constant vigilance” he explained that it was “probably unlikely” that anything would happen in the near future but “my fear is not just about the immediate term – it’s about what happens in the months and even years ahead.” Stressing his “absolute confidence” in the New York Police Department – with whom he has clashed on numerous occasions – he nevertheless insisted “there will not be a moment where we let down our guard particularly where the possibility of hostilities with such a dangerous adversary exist.” Of course just because the city might be besieged by frighteningly well-equipped government-backed “terrorists” doesn’t mean New Yorkers should change their routines. Citizens should “continue to go about our lives unafraid unaware always realistic tough” de Blasio advised after he had suitably terrified his audience. Representatives from the NYPD admitted there are “no specific credible threats” but pledged to “monitor the threat stream” and advised New Yorkers that “uniformed officers many with long guns” would be stationed in “sensitive areas.” The mayor said he was personally glad that Qassem Soleimani Iran’s beloved military commander was dead. But he added “we have to assume that this action puts us in a de facto state of war and that can only be done under the laws of the Constitution.” “We should not go to war with Iran – it’s extremely dangerous for the American people” de Blasio said. While Trump has yet to beg Congress for the green-light to go to war he has merely followed in the footsteps of Barack Obama who stretched a 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force that gave the military carte blanche to chase 'Al-Qaeda' into any country to justify his own Middle Eastern adventures. Curiously Trump himself has repeatedly said that it was time to end the “endless wars” in the region – something even de Blasio seems to agree with him on saying that “I think the American people have sent a message in election after election that we want to end all these wars.” Like this story?

93,None,"The Trump administration escalated its standoff with Iran to a whole new level on Friday by ordering a targeted assassination of Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s Quds Force. The Iranian general was blown up along with 11 other people including a senior commander of an Iraqi militia backed by Tehran when their motorcade was hit by US guided missiles just outside Baghdad International Airport. The attack marks a dramatic and extremely dangerous change in US policies vis-à-vis Iran Middle East-based journalist and writer Ali Rizk told RT. Washington claims it was justified in killing Soleimani because the Iranian general was planning attacks on American citizens. As the commander of the commando branch of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) he was directly involved in coordinating the activities of various militia groups in Iraq and Syria. The militias played an essential part in fighting against the terrorist group Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) in both countries boosting Iranian regional influence and Soleimani’s personal popularity. The American government which formally designated the IRGC a terrorist organization amid last year’s growing hostility towards Iran appears to see no difference between Soleimani and IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi who was killed in a US raid last October. But with Soleimani being a senior figure and ""part of a state apparatus"" this was a dangerous delusion Rizk believes adding that the precedent in turn will put crosshairs on every US official. Iran cannot let the attack simply slide and has already declared it an act of international terrorism. When Washington put the IRGC on its terrorist list Tehran did the same for the US Central Command (CENTCOM) which seemed like a symbolic gesture at the time. But Iran could now feel justified in targeting any American service member in the Middle East regardless of his or her rank. “If [Iran] doesn’t retaliate it will lose face it will appear as a very weak player in the Middle East which allows its senior officials to be assassinated” said political analyst and filmmaker Andre Vltchek. “If it does retaliate the US will reserve the right to even annihilate the country as we saw in the past.” Trump’s entire policy towards Iran was to put the screws on it without starting an actual shooting war with the presumable goal of signing a deal better than the Obama-era nuclear multilateral agreement that he had scrapped in 2018. So far both countries have steered away from any direct military engagement save for a few lost drones. There were several incidents such as attacks on oil tankers and Saudi Arabian refinery which Washington blamed on the IRGC. Iranian militias in Syria also absorbed dozens of attacks mainly by US ally Israel which sees the presence of the Tehran-backed fighters there as a threat to its national security. The killing of Soleimani is unlikely to get much support internationally with the obvious exceptions of Israel and Saudi Arabia Rizk said. Depending on how far Tehran goes to avenge its general it may even leave Trump with little choice but to declare a full-scale war against Iran an outcome that he tried to avoid but which some in his government as well as others in Tel Aviv and Riyadh have been dreaming about.  More importantly it sets a dangerous precedent that other nations will be looking at not least those that the US designates as rivals.“It was like a killing of the joint chief of staff of a country” Rizk said. “America later on could say: we have the right to target Russian or Chinese military officials. It’s very important for a major power not to let this issue pass.” Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

94,None,Much of Hollywood’s most politically active celebrities were not happy with the US assassination of Iran's Quds Force chief Qassem Soleimani but none were as broken up about it as actress Rose McGowan. The author and ‘Charmed’ actress took to Twitter to apologize on behalf of the US and to beg Iran “not to kill us.” “Dear #Iran The USA has disrespected your country your flag your people. 52% of us humbly apologize. We want peace with your nation. We are being held hostage by a terrorist regime. We do not know how to escape. Please do not kill us” she tweeted. To say the tweet did not go over well would be an understatement. The apology got both the actress’ name and “Dear Rose” trending on Twitter as many slammed the actress and even suggested she move out of the US and reside in Iran.  “Hey Rose  If Iran is so great you should go hang out there in the EXACT OUTFIT you're wearing in your profile picture and let us all know how it goes” author and comedian Tim Young wrote in response to McGowan. The actress is wearing a low-cut top in her profile image. “Are you on crack?” asked Daily Caller’s Greg Price.  Retired Marine and Fox News contributor Johnny Jones added that he was “ashamed” that Rose McGowan had previously visited wounded veterans at the Walter Reed hospital. “NOT INSANE” retired Army Infantry Colonel Kurt Schlicter sarcastically wrote in response to the actress. McGowan seemed to see which way the tide was turning so only hours after her initial tweet she sent out a half-hearted apology saying she simply did not want to see another war kick off and more American soldiers killed in combat. “Ok so I freaked out because we may have any impending war. Sometimes it’s okay to freak out on those in power. It’s our right. That is what so many Brave soldiers have fought for. That is democracy. I do not want any more American soldiers killed. That’s it” the actress who describes herself as a “conscientious objector to the USA” on Twitter wrote in her defense.  The apology only stirred the pot more with commenters totally unforgiving of McGowan’s earlier line about “being held hostage by a terrorist regime.” If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/477406-rose-mcgowan-iran-trump/,0.8103500478999837

The MP for Oxford West and Abingdon who was first elected to parliament in 2017 revealed she was in a relationship with former Lib Dem press officer Rosy Cobb.  She hit out at critics of her new relationship who suggested it could have a detrimental effect on her political career and branded Parliament as a ""weird and backward"" place when it came to attitudes towards LGBT+ people.

96,None,The decision to dismiss Torra from the office was made by the JEC on Friday with the board annulling an earlier ruling by a local Catalan electoral body which had said Torra could remain in power until he exhausts all appeal options. The Catalan leader was found guilty of disobedience by a Spanish court  on December 19 was fined the hefty sum of €33000 and banned from holding public office for a year. The politician has already vowed to challenge the court’s decision. Torra’s ‘disobedience’ dates back to last year’s general election when he was ordered by Spain’s electoral authority to remove signs and banners in favor of jailed independence leaders by early October but failed to comply. Displayed on the building of the Catalan government in Barcelona for instance was a message which read ‘Freedom for political prisoners and exiles’ across a yellow ribbon – a symbol used by the pro-independence Catalans to support the incarcerated leaders. The JEC ruling was met with anger by pro-independence politicians.

97,None,The entire 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division is now headed to the US base in Kuwait multiple outlets reported citing anonymous Pentagon officials on Friday. The deployment does not appear to be directly in response to the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani however but rather part of the build-up set in motion on Tuesday following the siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad.  A small force of US Marines reinforced the embassy and fended off the Iraqi Shia militia that had attempted to storm it in protest over a US airstrike against their bases last weekend. US President Donald Trump blamed Iran for both a rocket attack that killed one US contractor in Iraq last week and for the embassy siege. He ordered the retaliatory strike that killed Soleimani and several others the White House said. Soleimani was the head of the Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and coordinated operations throughout the Middle East including against Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) terrorists in Syria and Iraq. Washington considered him one of the most dangerous enemies to US interests in the region. Like this story?

98,None,The ministry slammed the assassination of the Iranian general carried out on orders from Washington calling it a “short-sighted” move that would lead to a “rapid escalation” of tensions in the Middle East. It also described Soleimani as a talented and experienced commander who enjoyed “well-earned authority” throughout the Middle East. In its statement the ministry called the Iranian general’s achievements in fighting international terrorism “undeniable” and warned that his death would be detrimental to the whole system of global security. Soleimani was seen as a key strategist coordinating the efforts of the Iranian advisers assisting both Syrian and Iraqi forces in their fight against terrorists. Iranian media reported that he’d personally assisted Baghdad in several counter-terrorism operations including the liberation of the strategic city of Tikrit from IS jihadists in 2015. The general was killed in a US drone strike at Baghdad’s airport along with Abud Mahdi al-Muhandis the deputy head of the Tehran-backed Iraqi Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) militia and eight other officials. The Pentagon argued its strike was necessary to protect Americans and prevent “future Iranian attack plans.” Iran denounced it as an “act of international terrorism.” Think your friends would be interested?

99,None,The 11-second clip first posted by the Iraqi TV station Ahad shows an explosion ripping through the parking lot outside Baghdad International Airport on Thursday evening. Ahad TV described the short recording as “the moment of brutal American aggression and the assassination of two martyr leaders Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis” referring to the Iranian general who headed the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the leader of the Iraqi Shia PMF militia. Early reports of the incident indicated that Soleimani and Al-Muhandis were traveling in two separate vehicles in a convoy and that multiple missiles were launched from either US drones or helicopters. Photos of the wreckage released by the Iraqi government also show multiple SUVs burned out on the side of the road by the airport. Think your friends would be interested?

100,None,The women sued GirlsDoPorn for fraud saying they were lured in with lucrative modeling gigs then told they would be shooting porn but only for foreign collectors and certainly not for the internet. The dishonest tactics “caused the videos to become common knowledge in plaintiffs’ communities and among their relations and peers – the very thing that plaintiffs feared and that defendants expressly assured them would not happen” San Diego Superior Court Judge Enright wrote in his ruling on Thursday.  Enright found that the GirlsDoPorn CEO Michael Pratt videographers Matthew Wolfe and Teddy Gyi and a handful of other conspirators had engaged in “malice oppression or fraud” and imposed a fine of $9.475 million in compensatory damages and $3.3 million in punitive damages. The deception he said occurred over the course of several years and caused severe harm to the victims.  “Collectively they have experienced severe harassment emotional and psychological trauma and reputational harm; lost jobs academic and professional opportunities and family and personal relationships; and had their lives derailed and uprooted” the judge said. Known only as Jane Does 1-22 the women said they were seduced with Craigslist ads for modeling gigs paying $5000 then told they’d be shooting a porn scene instead (usually for less money) when they arrived at the hotel where the shoot was to take place.  However the company told the women – then between the ages of 18 and 23 – that the porn videos they filmed would be distributed solely to private clients outside the US usually in Australia and New Zealand on DVD only and never with their names attached.  GirlsDoPorn even enlisted “reference women” to pose as satisfied “models” reassuring the “new recruits” that “the experience is safe and enjoyable and that the videos have never appeared online or been discovered by anyone in the models’ lives.” Several women claimed the defendants blocked their attempts to back out of the shoot by putting furniture in front of the door. Often after being plied with drugs and alcohol the women were handed an eight-page contract with a single reference to “online purposes” buried at the bottom of the second page and rushed to sign. Enright declared the contracts “unenforceable and void.”  GirlsDoPorn not only posted the videos to its own website but spread them to numerous popular porn sites including PornHub. The women also had links to the videos sent to their friends and family members and some were doxxed on online porn forums. Enright ordered GirlsDoPorn to remove photos and videos of the women from its website though it isn’t clear how or if the images have been scrubbed from other sites. What was originally a civil lawsuit has since spiraled into a federal sex trafficking and child pornography case. Wolfe is currently in jail along with actor Andre Garcia. Gyi secretary Valerie Moser and ‘reference woman’ Amberlyn Dee Nored were arrested but released on bond. Pratt is on the loose and believed to be hiding out in New Zealand; an arrest warrant has been issued for his failure to appear at the civil trial and he is extraditable under the child porn charges he faces.

101,None,The Quds Force chief was killed in a US airstrike alongside several other Iranian and Iraqi military commanders on the outskirts of the Iraqi capital on Thursday. While Washington – and Tel Aviv – claimed the killing was “defensive” in nature it caused an explosive reaction across Iraq and Iran with thousands strongly condemning the attack. The assassination sparked protests in other countries as well especially in those with sizable Shia Muslim populations. A handful of rallies were held in the Indian-controlled part of the disputed Kashmir region where people flocked to the streets to voice their anger over the murder. Hundreds of protesters also marched in the northern Indian town of Budgam carrying portraits of Soleimani and chanting anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans.   “We will take revenge of their act so that they will bow down. And it is going to be a lesson for our future generations” said an Islamic cleric who led the protests while another scholar insisted that the US and Israel “will be destroyed very soon.” A similar rally was held in the town of Kargil where locals turned up in large numbers to mourn the death of the prominent Iranian commander. Footage from the scene shows residents carrying portraits of Soleimani and placards reading “Down with the USA.” Large banners portraying Iranian leaders could also be seen hanging from several buildings in the town.

102,None,While some witnesses reported hearing the man shout “Allahu Akhbar” as he began stabbing people - seemingly at random - in a park in the Paris suburb of Villejuif on Friday prosecutors have stated they do not have evidence of radicalization as a motive though “elements linked to religion” that “suggested he had converted to Islam” were found among his belongings according to AFP. The man identified as 22-year-old Nathan C. from his credit card and fingerprints stabbed four people killing a 56-year-old man who tried to protect his wife from the knife-wielding attacker. Another victim is said to be in serious condition. The attacker was shot by police after fleeing to the nearby suburb of Hay-les-Roses. Prosecutors confirmed that Nathan C. had a history of mental health episodes. He is described in French media as a European (presumably white) man barefoot and bearded in a black djellaba.  A suitcase belonging to the attacker found near the site of the stabbings in Hautes-Bruyères Park contained “a very confused letter in which he spoke of Allah and asked for forgiveness” Le Figaro reports adding that “a religious book” - presumably the Koran prosecutors mentioned - “was found not far from his corpse.” While the knifeman was initially reported to be wearing an explosive vest after he reached into his pocket upon being shot an explosives team inspected his body afterwards and found no trace of explosives.

103,None,YouTube pranksters Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov who go by the names Vovan and Lexus are claiming they tricked Waters (Dem-Calif.) into thinking she was speaking to teen climate change activist Greta Thunberg. Vovan and Lexus made names for themselves by previously pranking Congressman Adam Schiff (Dem-Calif.) into thinking there were nude photos of US President Donald Trump that Schiff could get his hands on. They also claim to have pranked Waters two years ago in a phone call where one posed as Ukraine’s prime minister. Though Waters herself has not responded to the new video the woman at the other end of the phone identifies herself as the congresswoman and sounds an awful lot like her.  In the call the pranksters pretend to be Thunberg and her father with help from a female colleague and claim to have proof that Trump pressured the Ukrainian government into investigating his political rivals something Democrats have claimed for months now is true. Greta’s ‘father’ says on the call that his ‘daughter’ met Trump and he admitted to wrongdoing. “He said to her ‘You know little girl nobody believe you anyway I will tell you the truth. I really pushed on Ukrainian president and you know that you will never achieve your goals like those congressional fools that accuse me” the prankster posing as the famous teenager’s father says. “Oh my God he mentioned the Ukrainian president?” the woman who identifies herself as Waters responds.  ‘Greta’ then proceeds to offer to testify before Congress and Waters asks for a meeting when the teen activist is next in DC.  “And if the public knew that he talked to Greta like that he made her cry and told her she would never achieve – this will go against him too” Waters says. The pranksters claim to have the Trump conversation recorded which also gets Waters excited.  “You bring it to me” she says. “You tell me what day you can get there. And we’ll arrange to meet with you as quickly as we can.” Another highlight of the call is Waters being tricked into believing an island called “Chunga Changa” is an actual place dealing with serious environmental issues.  Though Waters is unlikely to ever admit anything about the call if it really is her Twitter users seem to have made up their mind.

104,None,Addressing the media at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Friday Trump said General Qassem Soleimani was “plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel” when the US “terminated” him.  “We take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over” he said of Soleimani who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force before his assassination on Thursday night at Baghdad International airport. “We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war” Trump argued repeating his often-stated line about “deep respect” for the people of Iran and disdain for their rulers. “We do not seek regime change” he added but the Iranian “regime’s aggression... must end and must end now.”  While describing Soleimani as a sinister “terrorist” Trump also claimed credit for defeating Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) and argued that the US will target anyone – Iran in particular – who threatens Americans anywhere. However Soleimani and his Quds Force played a key role in defeating both Al-Qaeda and IS terrorists in Syria spoiling the Obama administration’s plans for regime change in Damascus in the process. Soleimani was traveling in a convoy of cars next to Baghdad International Airport when it was struck by multiple missiles launched by US helicopters or drones. In addition to the Iranian general several leaders of the Iraqi Shia militia that had also fought against IS were killed and injured. Washington has blamed Iran and the militia for Tuesday’s siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad – the latest in a string of incidents in Iraq for which Washington has blamed Tehran. Fears that Soleimani’s assassination might spark a war with Iran have been fueled by the news that almost 4000 US troops were deployed to Kuwait this week joining 14000 sent to the region last year as the Pentagon beefs up its military presence citing the “threat” from Tehran.

105,None,Soleimani was killed on Thursday in a strike outside Baghdad International Airport for which the White House admitted responsibility later that evening. In a statement to RT on Friday retired Virginia Senator Richard Black said the assassination “may presage a new war of aggression—this time against the Iranian people.” Black noted that the commander of the IRGC’s Quds Force had led the fight against both Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) terrorists and Al-Qaeda affiliates in Syria.  The former senator who retired at the end of 2019 cautioned against further escalation in the Middle East recalling a claim predating the 2003 invasion of Iraq that regime change in Tehran was the ultimate objective. “I pray that we draw back from the vast war that looms” Black added. “Neither our soldiers nor our people have a voice to stop it.” Having served in the US Marines during the Vietnam War Black became an outspoken critic of US involvement in Syria during his last term in the Virginia Senate. In 2014 he thanked Syrian President Bashar Assad for saving Christians and Jews from Al-Qaeda and IS. The following year IS dubbed him an “American Crusader” and put him on its enemies list.

106,None,The general vowed to “confront and expel” foreign forces in a statement on Friday singling out Ankara by name. “We declare jihad and general mobilization to counter the Turkish invasion” Haftar said. “The Turkish friendly people must rise up against the adventurers who force their army to be wiped out in Libya.” The Turkish parliament on Thursday gave the go-ahead for deploying soldiers to reinforce its allies in the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) one of the factions vying for control of Libya since the 2011 ouster of leader Muammar Gaddafi in a US-led NATO operation. Ankara expressed hopes however that the deployment would be unnecessary and that Haftar would halt his months-long offensive on Tripoli launched in April 2019. Though the GNA is the internationally recognized government of Libya most of the country is controlled by a rival government based in Tobruk and LNA troops loyal to Haftar. Under attack since the middle of last year the GNA has been confined to the area around its base of operations in Tripoli. Some observers fear that sending troops could only worsen matters in Libya propelling the war into greater levels of bloodshed. The country is still reeling from the aftermath of Gaddafi’s removal from power – spearheaded by former US President Barack Obama – which ignited years of violent conflict drove Europe’s refugee crisis and created lawlessness in which terror groups flourish.

107,None,On Friday the LNA said it had shot down a Turkish drone south of Tripoli the seat of the Government of National Accord (GNA). One report identified it as a Bayraktar TB2 armed drone downed after targeting a column of LNA vehicles. On Thursday theTurkish parliament approved the deployment of troops advisers and equipment to Libya to prop up the GNA the internationally recognized authority which controls only a small portion of the country. The exact scope of the deployment was not made public. General Haftar who runs the LNA on behalf of a rival legislature based in Tobruk vowed on Friday to “confront and expel” foreign forces. “We declare jihad and general mobilization to counter the Turkish invasion” Haftar said. “The Turkish friendly people must rise up against the adventurers who force their army to be wiped out in Libya.” Haftar’s LNA has been advancing on Tripoli in fits and starts since April 2019 having secured control over most of Libya except for the deep desert in the south. Libya collapsed into chaos and civil war after the NATO-backed regime change operation in 2011 overthrew the government of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi that had run the country since 1969.

108,None,The three-car convoy was struck in the northern outskirts of the Iraqi capital in the district of al-Taji late on Friday according to an Iraqi military source cited by Reuters. Six militiamen were reportedly killed in the attack with three others critically injured. It remains unclear who carried out the strike. An unconfirmed photo of the aftermath of the attack emerged on social media showing three burning vehicles two of them overturned. The six killed in the strike have yet to be named but early reports suggesting they hit two paramilitary commanders – Shibl al-Zaydi secretary general of the Kataib al-Imam militia as well as Qais al-Khazali leader of Asaib Ahl al-Haq – were refuted by the PMF in a statement. Instead of senior leaders the convoy contained medics the group said. “Initial sources confirm that the strike targeted a convoy of Popular Mobilisation Forces medics near Taji stadium in Baghdad” said the statement cited by Reuters. The bombing comes on the heels of a US air raid near Baghdad International Airport late Thursday night which killed Iran’s powerful Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani and several top officials in the PMF. Washington argued the strike was “aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans” while Tehran slammed the move as an act of “international terrorism” and threatened “crushing revenge.” Though US President Donald Trump insisted the decision was made “to stop a war” stressing that he didn’t seek “regime change” in Tehran that interpretation was clearly not shared by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei who warned “revenge awaits the criminals who have stained their hands in [Soleimani’s] blood.” Think your friends would be interested?

109,None,The killing of Soleimani “by any measure is an obvious example of State terrorism and as a criminal act constitutes a gross violation of the fundamental principles of international law including in particular those stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations” Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi wrote in a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the Security Council on Friday. Soleimani the head of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for over 20 years was killed in a US drone strike outside Baghdad International Airport in Iraq on Thursday. Ravanchi added that Tehran reserves the right to self-defense under international law.  The envoy followed this up with interviews to NBC and CNN on Friday evening calling the killing of Soleimani an “act of aggression” and “tantamount to opening a war against Iran.” He confirmed that Iran and the US have exchanged letters through a Swiss intermediary but told NBC that he thinks the administration of US President Donald Trump “does not believe in dialogue.” The assassination he told NBC was “an act of aggression by the United States and we cannot just close our eyes on what happened to a dear general of our armed forces.” Speaking to CNN Ravanchi only elaborated that “the response for a military action is a military action.” Soleimani’s death was planned for “quite some time” Ravanchi argued pointing to a tweet by former Trump adviser John Bolton a known advocate of regime change in Tehran as proof.  Earlier on Friday Trump called Soleimani the “number one terrorist” in the world. The ambassador took exception to that pointing to the general’s role in fighting against both Al-Qaeda affiliates and Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) in Iraq and Syria. “The US cannot claim that it is fighting terror when at the same time it is killing the champion of defeating terrorists in our region” Ravanchi told NBC.

110,None,The plan will be considered at the church’s major yearly conference in Minneapolis set for May which if approved would rupture the denomination into traditionalist and ‘progressive’ camps. The former branch would continue to oppose LGBT marriage and the ordination of gay and lesbian clergy while the other will open its doors to anyone regardless of sexual orientation. “The protocol provides a pathway that acknowledges our differences respects everyone in the process and graciously allows us to continue to live out the mission of making disciples of Jesus Christ” said New York Conference Bishop Thomas Bickerton who helped draft the proposal. Detailed in a 9-page document released on Friday the schism plan proposes setting aside $25 million in church funds for the traditionalist branch to ease the separation process and would not alter ownership of local church properties. While church leaders say the split would impact Methodist organizations around the globe potentially affecting millions of members a Washington DC-based council of bishops hailed the idea on Friday as the “best means to resolve our differences.” Traditionalist Reverend Keith Boyette said much the same calling it a “fair and equitable solution that puts decades of conflict behind us and gives us a hopeful future.” Same-sex marriage was legalized across the United States by the Supreme Court in 2015 but religious organizations retain the right to decline to officiate gay wedding ceremonies. The plan was developed with the aid of Kenneth Feinberg an attorney and mediator who made his name working on several high-profile cases usually overseeing pay disbursements to plaintiffs including the 2010 British Petroleum oil spill. He was also appointed by the Obama administration’s Department of Justice in 2016 to manage the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.

111,None,The US-led forces “did NOT conduct airstrikes” in the area in recent days the spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve Colonel Myles Caggins tweeted. Earlier Reuters reported citing an Iraqi Army source that six people were killed and three critically injured in a raid that Iraqi state media blamed on the United States. The Iran-backed Shia militia Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) then reportedly claimed that the airstrike hit a convoy of medics. The reports came after a US drone strike killed the chief of Iran’s elite Quds Force Major General Qassem Soleimani and PMF deputy commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis at Baghdad’s airport.

112,None,In a new press release cited by several news agencies the PMF leadership retracted their statement in which the group said their medics were hit by a US airstrike. This happened after Reuters cited Iraqi Army sources who said that six people were killed in a raid near Taji. The Iraqi Army however later denied that an airstrike took place there. In a statement quoted by local media the military urged everyone to be “careful” about spreading unverified information and “rumors” in the future. The US-led coalition in Iraq also said that no air raids have been conducted in that area in recent days. The news came after the chief of Iran’s elite Quds Force Major General Qassem Soleimani and PMF deputy commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed by a US drone at Baghdad’s airport. Washington said that Soleimani was targeted in order to deter future attacks by Iran against US military personnel and citizens in Iraq and other places abroad.

116,None,The Tripoli-based government of Al-Sarraj struck a military agreement with Turkey which prompted Ankara to send its troops to Libya. Their aim is to confront Khalifa Haftar the powerful Libyan military commander based in the eastern port of Tobruk. The Libyan parliament which backs Haftar said on Saturday it refused to ratify the Turkey deal and called for pressing high treason charges against Fayez Al-Sarraj Al Arabiya reported. The lawmakers said they may refer the situation to the International Court of Justice. Haftar who commands the so-called Libyan National Army earlier declared mobilization to fight against Turkish troops calling their looming deployment an invasion. Libya once one of the most prosperous nations in Africa remains fractured and devastated since the 2011 NATO bombing campaign that helped militant forces oust and kill long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi. After the war the country became a playground for various competing militias as well as a major human trafficking thoroughfare. Like this story?

117,None,The temple also known as Gurdwara Nankana Sahib (named after the city in Pakistan’s Punjab province) is a cherished treasure built on the site where the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak Dev was believed to be born. On Friday the location was surrounded by dozens of angry Muslim protesters who were filmed chanting anti-Sikh slogans. The protesters were blocking the entrance to the Gurdwara and according to some reports went as far as tossing stones not only at the building but also at pilgrims. The local police soon arrived and hours later the crowd dispersed. The incident received an angry rebuke from New Delhi. India’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned what it described as “wanton acts of destruction and desecration of the holy place” and called on the Pakistani government “to take immediate steps to ensure the safety security and welfare of members of the Sikh community”. The anger also spilled into street protests in the Indian capital where several Sikh groups gathered on Saturday in front of the office of Pakistan’s High Commissioner to demand protection both for fellow believers based in Pakistan and the treasured holy site. Islamabad downplayed the seriousness of the situation saying it stemmed from a family feud and denied that the Gurdwara was vandalized during the protest. “Attempts to paint this incident as a communal issue are patently motivated. Most importantly the Gurdwara remains untouched and undamaged” said Pakistan’s Foreign Office. “All insinuations to the contrary particularly the claims of acts of 'desecration and destruction' and desecration of the holy place are not only false but also mischievous.” According to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn the protest was led by the family of a Muslim man named Mohammed Ehsan. The paper states the family is currently embroiled in a conflict with the Sikh family of Ehsan’s wife 19-year-old Jagjit Kaur who converted to Islam and married him. Kaur is reported to be the daughter of the Gurdwara's granthi - a ceremonial reader of the Sikh´s Holy Book. The wife’s family insists she was abducted by Ehsan’s family forcefully converted and married to Ehsan. His family denies the accusations insisting both the conversion and the marriage were voluntary. A court eventually ordered that Kaur be removed from the home of the Ehsan family in Lahor and housed at a shelter while the investigation into the conflict is underway. The situation escalated on Friday after the police arrested several members of the Ehsan family including the husband himself. The protest ended after the detainees were released. Like this story?

118,None,“Vital American targets in the region have been identified by Iran a long time ago” General Gholamali Abuhamzeh who leads the IRGC in Iran’s southern Kerman Province said on Friday evening as quoted by Tasnim News Agency.  The commander did not name any specific targets but mentioned that US warships have been operating in the Strait of Hormuz an important shipping route which connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean. Abuhamzeh made the comments after Soleimani the leader of the IRGC’s Quds Force – a special unit tasked with operations abroad – was killed in a US drone strike at a Baghdad airport. He died along with several high-ranking officials from the Iran-backed Iraqi Shia militias the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). Kerman is Soleimani’s home province. He is expected to be buried there on Sunday.  Killing the Quds leader was the “biggest strategic mistake” the US has made in its four decades of standoff with Iran Abuhamzeh said promising that Tehran will “exact revenge.” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stressed that Iran “does not seek tensions in the region.”  However “the presence and interference of the foreign and extra-regional forces have caused instability insecurity and escalation of tensions” Zarif said during a meeting with his Qatari counterpart Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani in Tehran. Officials in Washington say that Soleimani’s death has prevented major terrorist attacks against the US and saved “hundreds” of American lives. US President Donald Trump has gone as far as calling Soleimani the “number one terrorist in the world” ignoring the fact that the general played a key role in the defeat of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) in Syria and Iraq.

Later on Fox &amp; Friends Gabbard stressed that by approving the raid Trump was ""clearly violating the Constitution."" Major General Soleimani was killed in a drone strike at Baghdad's airport on Friday morning. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis the deputy commander of Iran-backed militias the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and eight other officials died with him. US State Secretary Mike Pompeo and the Pentagon insisted that Soleimani was killed in order to prevent future attacks by Iran against US army personnel and civilians. Tehran in turn called the action an act of ""international terrorism"" and vowed to retaliate. The operation was heavily criticized by the Democrats including senators and 2020 hopefuls Joe Biden Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders as well House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who is leading the impeachment of Trump. They all said that the killing of Soleimani further increases tensions in the Middle East and brings Washington closer to an open war with Iran.   Trump's allies in the Republican Party on the other hand welcomed the airstrike with Senator Lindsey Graham calling it ""a preemptive defensive"" action against Iran.

120,None,France has endured a full month of protests against the controversial reform – on Saturday the general strike reached its 31st consecutive day. Moreover Saturday’s action coincided with Act 60 of the anti-government Yellow Vests protests that have been plaguing France for over a year now. The protesters carried the flags of various trade unions as well as assorted banners that primarily targeted pension reform. Some of them lit firecrackers on the march. One man however was spotted carrying a large plush heart bearing a very personal message for France’s President Emmanuel Macron. The inscription on the giant plushie reads “Macron I hate you with all my heart.”  The infamous 'Macron out' slogan frequently used by the Yellow Vests has apparently evolved over the year of turmoil; at least one banner reading “Macron out – and take your reform with you” has been spotted during the protest. So far the protest remains relatively peaceful despite large numbers of people attending – only minor clashes with the police and very limited use of tear gas have been reported. The pension protests broadly supported by French trade unions kicked off in early December taking form of mass rallies attempts to block infrastructure strikes and work walkouts. The unrest was triggered by the government’s plan to scrap the existing 42 pension schemes and roll out a unified points-based one instead. Critics of the reform accuse the government of trying to rip the workers off and stealing their hard-earned benefits such as the right to early retirement for certain jobs. The authorities however maintain the reform is actually designed to simplify the pension system and make it more transparent.

121,None,Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed that his nation opposes the use of military force after hearing from his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif who condemned the US’ targeted assassination of Major General Qassem Soleimani on Friday. Wang stressed that the US operation was a breach of international norms and threatened to significantly increase turbulence in the region. The Trump administration’s strategy of maximum pressure against Tehran was impractical the Chinese diplomat added promising that Beijing will hold an objective and fair position necessary to improve the situation in the Middle East. A similar position was voiced by Russia’s Sergey Lavrov who spoke to Zarif on Saturday to express Russia’s condolences over the killing of Soleimani. American behavior fails to address the many problems in the Middle East and only escalates regional tensions the two diplomats agreed. Soleimani the commander of the elite Quds Force was killed in a targeted assassination which Washington claims was necessary to prevent attacks on American citizens. Tehran vowed it would avenge the death of the popular general. If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/news/477468-china-us-abuse-force-soleimani/,0.8103578706227135
122,None,Germany’s Bundeswehr will put on pause all military missions in Iraq it announced late on Friday night. That includes both operations aimed against IS and training of Kurdish troops. There are around 130 German soldiers deployed in Iraq at the moment including 27 stationed at the Taji military base 30km (18 miles) north of Baghdad. The same security lockdown is true for the 70 soldiers from Sweden who act as advisers to the Iraqi military. “We have to see what happens. We cannot go into details for safety reasons but we have paused and taken it hour by hour” explained Swedish military spokesperson Kristina Swaan. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called the situation serious for the 140 soldiers the country has in Iraq but wouldn’t comment on whether it was necessary to bring them home as a precaution. NATO which has many of the same members as the anti-IS coalition has suspended its training operations in Iraq too spokesman for the alliance Dylan White said. NATO has hundreds of personnel under its aegis in the country. The anti-IS coalition members initiated a curfew for its troops following the killing of Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s Quds Force by a US airstrike on Friday morning. Tehran pledged retaliation for what it sees as an act of international terrorism. The killing also led to mass protests in Iran and several other Middle Eastern countries where the assassinated general was perceived as a hero by many. Soleimani played a crucial role in organizing and supporting Shiite militias to fight against IS in Iraq and Syria. The US claimed the assassination was an act of pre-emptive self-defense.

123,None,When you deliberately kill an important figure for political reasons it’s fair to say that you have assassinated them. But the word has this nasty aftertaste smacking of some criminality or even brainwashed youths with crooked knives. READ MORE: 35 ‘vital US &amp; Israeli targets’ within Iran’s reach for potential REVENGE for General Soleimani’s death – senior IRGC commander So one John Harwood the editor-at-large at CNBC took to Twitter to argue that the killing of Iran’s Quds Force commander should be described in some nicer terms. And if the term is right “did [the] US ‘assassinate’ Osama Bin Laden?” he asked.  It didn’t take long for him to get feedback and the collective answer seemed to be a resounding “yes” to both questions. Some commenters went further and challenged the implied equivalency between the two killings. After all Qassem Soleimani was a high-ranking officer of a UN member country’s military not a stateless fugitive living in obscurity. READ MORE: Iran reserves right to self-defense ‘harsh revenge’ for Soleimani coming – Tehran’s envoy to UN There was also the legal issue of authorization by the US Congress. Bin Laden’s killing was agreed to by US legislators after the 9/11 terrorist attack while Soleimani was targeted in what many have called an abuse of presidential power that may land the US in a new war. Doubts about the strike are widespread even among the centrist part of the Democratic Party which tacitly endorses the claim that Soleimani was a legitimate target for a targeted attack. Donald Trump himself has called Soleimani a “number one” terrorist – which sounds puzzling as the general was instrumental in the defeat of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) which the US president likes taking full credit for.

124,None,The hoisting ceremony was aired by Iranian state TV on Saturday. The blood-red flag as well as a picture of the slain commander of the elite Quds Force were carried to the roof of the one of the biggest and most important mosques for Shia Muslims. The flag used in the ceremony is called the ‘Ya la-Tharat al-Husayn’ which dates back to the late 7th century. It was first raised after the Battle of Karbala in a call to avenge the death of Imam Husayn ibn Ali which became one of the key events that led to the split between Shia and Sunni Islam. It has been reported that the red flag has never been unfurled atop the Jamkaran (a major holy site since the early Middle Ages) until now. Red flags were also spotted during other events held across country in honor of the slain general. Thousands gathered in Tehran on Saturday shouting slogans and carrying pictures of Soleimani. Some were seen setting Israeli flags on fire. In Iraq where Soleimani was killed in a US airstrike alongside other high-ranking Iranian and Iraqi officials including the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) militia a three-day mourning period has been announced. Commemorative ceremonies there saw people stomping on and burning American flags. A mourning house for Soleimani has been opened in Gaza where people were also seen venting their anger at the US and Israel as well as paying their respects to the dead.

125,None,The freak incident occurred at Barddhaman railway station located in the Indian state of West Bengal late Saturday. Footage from the scene shows part of the building’s upper floor abruptly collapsing disintegrating into fine dust.  The incident attracted a large crowd of onlookers who came to watch and film the destruction with their cellphones. This turned out to be a pretty bad idea as the damaged part of the building collapsed further dropping a massive sign affixed to its roof right onto the crowd. The subsequent collapse however did not deter the onlookers and a large crowd remains close to the badly damaged building footage from the scene shows. Emergency services have been dispatched to the scene and they are reportedly searching for people who might be trapped under the rubble. Construction work at the station has been blamed for the collapse. At least two people were hospitalized after the incident according to Eastern Railway while four others received medical help onsite. Think your friends would be interested?

126,None,Several unguided ‘Katyusha’ rockets landed inside the Green Zone the military said in a statement cited by Reuters. There have been no reported casualties so far. Some accounts say one rocket landed not far from the US embassy. One blast allegedly blocked the road leading to the American diplomatic mission in the Iraqi capital. Mortar shells also hit the neighboring Jadriya district where Baghdad University is located injuring at least five people. A separate report suggests that Balad Air Base located some 60 kilometers north of Baghdad has also come under rocket attack. The base houses some American troops. Meanwhile Iraqi Shia militia Kataib Hezbollah has issued a warning to local security forces implying more attacks are coming. People must stay at least one kilometer away from US bases and facilities housing American troops in Iraq starting Sunday evening they were quoted saying by local media. They stopped short of claiming responsibility for Saturday’s rocket attacks though. The incidents come a day after Washington ordered the assassination of one of Iran’s top commanders Major General Qassem Soleimani. The Iraqi Shia PMF militia deputy commander was also killed in the US drone strike alongside a dozen others. The US claimed the assassination was an act of pre-emptive self-defense. Tehran called it an act of international terrorism and vowed revenge. Massive demonstrations mourning the death of Soleimani and the Iraqi militia commanders were held in both Iraq and Iran.

127,None,The base located some 60km (40 miles) to the north of Baghdad came under attack late on Saturday Reuters reported citing security sources. Two unguided rockets hit the premises of the compound but caused no casualties among the personnel. It was not immediately clear whether they inflicted any material damage. The incident hit the headlines shortly after two explosions hit the Green Zone – the heavily fortified quarter of the Iraqi capital that houses foreign missions and government buildings. One rocket reportedly hit in the vicinity of the US embassy reportedly damaging a road. Meanwhile Iraqi Shia paramilitary group Kataib Hezbollah has warned local forces to steer clear of any US bases or compounds housing American troops. To stay safe they must remain at least one kilometer away from such facilities the group said implying that further attacks are expected. Kataib Hezbollah which emerged during the 2003 invasion of Iraq has been waging anti-US insurgency for years. Currently however it is part of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) – a government-sponsored umbrella organization that united and recognized various militant groups during the Washington-backed campaign against Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) terrorists. The incidents followed the assassination of the Iranian Quds Force commander Major General Qassem Soleimani. He was killed in a US airstrike on the outskirts of Baghdad alongside several other high-ranking Iranian and Iraqi military officials. The killing prompted a furious reaction both in Iran and Iraq. Tehran vowed retaliation for Soleimani’s death which it described as an act of international terrorism. The elite Iranian IRGC force said that at least 35 “vital” US and Israeli targets in the region are within its reach for a guaranteed strike. Iraq meanwhile accused the US of violating its sovereignty. Washington for its part insisted that the assassination was “defensive” in its nature accusing Soleimani of being behind the deaths of “hundreds” of US citizens and alleging he was planning new attacks on the nation’s troops across the region.

There have been no official reports of injuries but video footage appears to show civilians being injured as a result of the attacks. There appear to be no US military casualties at this time.    The Saturday attacks follow the Friday assassination of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani in a US drone strike as well as pro-Iran protesters storming the US Embassy in a siege earlier this week.  If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/news/477480-iraq-rocket-attacks-aftermath/,0.8103287505310016
129,None,The 22-year-old suspect identified only as Nathan C went on a rampage at a park to the south of the French capital. The attacker managed to kill a 56-year-old man and injure two more people before the police gunned him down. It apparently took over a day for the French authorities to attribute a terrorist motive to the stabbing as the case was referred to the country’s anti-terrorism prosecutor late on Saturday. The rampage was initially investigated by local prosecutors who said that they uncovered “elements linked to religion” among the suspect’s personal belongings which “suggested he had converted to Islam” recently. The suspect’s possessions included a copy of the Koran which was recovered close to his body. French media described the attacker as a European (presumably white) bearded man who was barefoot at the time of the incident and wore a black djellaba. Local prosecutors however said that the man actually had a history of mental health problems and that “no evidence” of radicalization had been uncovered as of Friday night.

130,None,In these strange modern times even a liberal director like Gilliam can end up sounding like a conservative voice. In an interview with the Independent promoting his film ‘The Man Who Killed Don Quixote’ which has been in various states of production for 20 years Gilliam gave his blunt thoughts on everything from disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein to possibly identifying as a black lesbian. Speaking about #MeToo cases Gilliam said despite there being real victims the movement was driven by a mob mentality.  “Yeah I said #MeToo is a witch hunt” Gilliam said.  The director said many who came forward should have taken more responsibility for their situations as he believes a female character who works as a model and escort does in his new film. “We’re living in a time where there’s always somebody responsible for your failures and I don’t like this. I want people to take responsibility and not just constantly point a finger at somebody else saying ‘You’ve ruined my life.’” Speaking on the topic of producers like Harvey Weinstein who faced dozens of sexual assault and sexual harassment accusations that kicked off the #MeToo movement Gilliam said no one should be surprised about the things that were happening in Hollywood. He even revealed that he was once propositioned by a “well-known actress” for a part in one of his movies.  Gilliam also doubled down in the interview on a statement he made last year proclaiming to be a black lesbian. While the “revelation” was meant to be a joke mocking modern identity politics ‘woke’ crowds did not see the humor – and neither did Gilliam’s latest interviewer.  “I’m talking about being a man accused of all the wrong in the world because I’m white-skinned. So I better not be a man. I better not be white. OK since I don’t find men sexually attractive I’ve got to be a lesbian. What else can I be? I like girls. These are just logical steps” he said. “I’m just trying to make you start thinking. You see this is the world I grew up in and with Python we could do this stuff and we weren’t offending people. We were giving people a lot of laughter.” On the subject of “giving people a lot of laughter” though the filmmaker seems to believe there is little benefit to being the offensive comedian in today’s bubble-wrapped culture.  If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/477484-terry-gilliam-white-men-metoo/,0.8103178570098541
131,None,Air India flight AI 865 was about to make the trip between India’s capital Delhi and Mumbai on Thursday when an apparent technical glitch forced the plane full of passengers to return from the runaway to its ramp. The crew however did not let the passengers disembark immediately apparently hoping the issue was minor and would be resolved more or less on the spot. This proved however not to be the case. The passengers had to spend more than four hours effectively trapped on the plane before they were finally cleared to get off the aircraft. The long hours of waiting began to wear on people’s patience. Footage emerged online showing disgruntled passengers standing in the aisle as the cabin crew attempts to calm things down. A group of particularly agitated people can be seen knocking on the cockpit door demanding the pilots come out. Some can be heard calling the pilots “losers” while others threaten to break down the door. The cabin crew still somehow managed to keep things under control as according to local media the passengers spent around two more hours inside the plane without much disturbance and the cockpit remained intact. However after more than four hours of waiting some perhaps understandably just about completely lost it. As the crew was about to let the passengers out a woman rushed to the exit door to open it on her own. A flight attendant had to intervene as other passengers pleaded with the woman to let it go. Eventually the passengers flew to Mumbai on another aircraft following an eight-hour delay. All’s well that ends well but that may not apply to at least some of the passengers who could face consequences over their angry outbursts as both the airline and India’s civil aviation regulator DGCA have launched an inquiry into the case. “DGCA has asked Air India management to take necessary action against unruly passengers” the regulator’s official told the local media. India has recently introduced new rules aimed at countering disruptive behavior on airplanes. The punishments under these regulations vary from three-months’ grounding over “physical gestures or verbal harassment” to a lifetime ban on flying for “life-threatening behavior” damage to an aircraft and attempted or actual breach of cockpit.

132,None,"The ministry has ordered the Royal Navy’s HMS Montrose frigate and HMS Defender destroyer to prepare to accompany all vessels sailing under the British flag through the Strait of Hormuz — the only passage from the Persian Gulf to the ocean that lies between the Iranian and UAE coasts. “The government will take all necessary steps to protect our ships and citizens at this time” Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said commenting on the decision. The move comes after the US killed Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani the commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ elite Quds Force on orders from President Donald Trump. The attack dramatically heightened tensions in the Middle East as Tehran labeled it an act of international terrorism and vowed revenge. Washington maintained it was an act of “self-defense.” London apparently shares that position as Wallace also said that the US “is entitled to defend itself against those posing an imminent threat to their citizens” under international law. However he also called for “de-escalation.” The spike of tensions in the Middle East apparently unnerved the British government as the UK Foreign Ministry has advised its citizens against traveling to Iraq and Iran. ""Given heightened tensions in the region the Foreign Office now advise people not to travel to Iraq with the exception of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and to consider carefully whether it's essential to travel to Iran"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement. London had already sent its warships to patrol the Strait of Hormuz amid another crisis related to Iran earlier this year. Tensions were sparked in July after the seizure of an Iranian-flagged tanker by the British marines off the coast of Gibraltar. Iran denounced this as an act of “state piracy” and retaliated by seizing a UK-flagged vessel as it entered the Strait. The Iranian tanker was released in late August and the British ship was released a month later. The crisis was instrumentalized by Washington which used it to call for a coalition to police Western tankers traveling through the Strait — and London was one of the first to join it.

134,None,Rocker Meat Loaf is making waves on social media for being one of the latest critics of teen climate change activist Greta Thunberg – and a blunt one at that.  “I feel for that Greta” the 'Paradise by the Dashboard Light' singer told Daily Mail in a recent interview. He added that he believes the 17-year-old Thunberg has been “brainwashed into thinking there is climate change.” The rocker said he does not believe in climate change.  “She hasn’t done anything wrong but she’s been forced into thinking that what she is saying is true” the 72-year-old musician said. It should come with little to no surprise that Meat Loaf’s comments were like throwing a match into the kindling that is social media.  Some criticized the rock star for his criticism of Thunberg who has also been targeted by US President Donald Trump and for his apparent denial of global warming. “It’s almost like Meat Loaf is praying for the end of time to hurry up and arrive” comedian and actor John Fugelsang tweeted. However the rocker found plenty of support for his blunt remarks as well.  “Met Meat Loaf on an airplane once.  Lovely gracious funny man. Good to see he's got a good head on his shoulders and he isn't afraid of the leftist bullies in the business” tweeted outspoken conservative actor and director Nick Searcy. “Meat Loaf is completely correct about Greta Thunberg” conservative reporter Paul Joseph Watson tweeted.

135,None," Unleashing yet another dire warning to Iran Trump appears to have responded to a recent statement by a senior commander within the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) who said earlier on Saturday that Iran had identified 35 vital US and Israeli targets in the region “a long time ago.” ""If Iran strikes any Americans or American assets we have... targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago) some at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; the Iranian culture and those targets and Iran itself WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD"" Trump tweeted. Trump did not specify which sites the Pentagon had placed on its hit list saying only that some of the targets are “at a very high level.” The threat comes as tensions between Washington and Tehran have reached the boiling point after a US drone strike near Baghdad on Thursday killed the leader of the IRGC’s Quds Force – a special unit tasked with operations abroad. Major General Qassem Soleimani who Trump called Iran’s “terrorist leader” was instrumental in the defeat of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) in Syria and Iraq. The Trump administration’s move to assassinate Soleimani has drawn a mixed reaction in the US. Democratic lawmakers as well as their Republican colleagues were unaware of the operation. But while the GOP has largely rejoiced at the move the Democrats have been crying foul accusing Trump of single-handedly steering the US into a potential all-out war with Iran. The White House formally notified Congress about the strike late Saturday – which however did not placate the Democrats as it apparently shed little light on the circumstances behind Soleimani’s takedown. In a statement on Saturday House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi slammed the strike as “provocative escalatory and disproportionate military engagement” noting that the War Act Powers notice given to lawmakers “prompts serious and urgent questions about the timing manner and justification” of the attack. She also criticized what she called the “highly unusual” decision to classify the document “in its entirety” saying that “the Congress and the American people are being left in the dark about our national security.” She went on to urge Trump to provide “an immediate comprehensive briefing of the full Congress on military engagement related to Iran and next steps under consideration.” Subscribe to RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won’t tell you.

136,None, “The night of Jan. 4 two rocket attacks occurred near Iraqi bases that host Coalition troops in Baghdad and Balad a total of 13 attacks in the past two months” a statement attributed to coalition spokesman Colonel Myles B. Caggins III said Saturday. The attacks took place within the span of four minutes on Saturday evening local time Caggins reported saying that the first of the two attacks targeted the heavily-fortified Green Zone which hosts a number of diplomatic and military facilities including some that house US troops. Noting that no US military were injured in the shelling the spokesman said that it could have “potentially” led to casualties among the civilian population. “At 7:46 p.m. the International Zone took indirect fire that landed outside of Coalition facilities and potentially harmed Iraqi civilians” the statement read. Several minutes after the rockets hit the Green Zone Balad Air Base located 60 kilometers north of Baghdad which serves as home to some US troops also came under rocket fire the coalition confirmed saying that the Iraqi military has launched an investigation into both incidents. The US coalition’s statement that their forces were apparently targeted in two consecutive rocket attacks comes shortly after US President Donald Trump upped the ante in the war of words with Tehran vowing to strike as many as 52 Iranian sites if Iran makes good on its vow to avenge the assassination of Major General Qassem Soleimani a hugely popular commander of the Revolutionary Guards Corps’ Quds Force in a US drone strike on Thursday. Earlier this week the US Embassy in Baghdad barely escaped a takeover by Iraqi protesters following a series of US airstrikes that killed 25 Shia militia fighters a week ago. The demonstrators chanted “death to America” and even managed to set checkpoints on fire. Security personnel deployed tear gas to force the angry crowds to retreat.

137,None,The website run by the FDPL a US government program set up to ensure federal government publications are available to the public free of charge was apparently hacked by a group claiming to be from Iran on Saturday evening. The site which currently cannot be accessed briefly showed a message purportedly left by hackers calling themselves ‘Iran Cyber Security Group HackerS’ The front page showed a close-up shot of US President Donald Trump being punched in the face with blood coming out of his mouth. The fist was made to look like it belonged to a uniformed member of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with the elite force’s official logo known as Pasdaran visible on the sleeve. Accompanying the picture was a message in Persian and in English promising “severe revenge” on those complicit in the assassination of the IRGC’s Quds Force leader Qassem Soleimani who was killed in a US drone strike in Baghdad on Thursday. While it has since been taken down the message purportedly left by “Iranian hackers” can still be found on Google search. “In the name of god. Hacked By Iran Cyber Security Group HackerS;). This is only small part of Iran's cyber ability ! We're always ready” it reads. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed the breach late Saturday but did not immediately point the finger at Tehran. “At this time there is no confirmation that this was the action of Iranian state-sponsored actors” Sara Sendek a spokesperson for DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said as cited by CNN. The Government Publishing Office (GPO) which runs the program noted that the website was take down as soon as the “intrusion” was discovered. The incident comes just hours after the DHS sounded the alarm over a supposed “terrorism threat” to the US from Iran saying that the Islamic Republic “can execute cyber-attacks against the United States” that may have a “temporary disruptive effect” on critical infrastructure. Following the killing of Soleimani who played an important role in the fight against Al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) in both Iraq and Syria Iran said that it reserves the right to retaliate. A senior commander within the IRGC said on Saturday that the Iranian military has identified 35 US and Israeli targets in the region. Hours after the warning was issued Trump stirred tensions even further saying the US is ready to fire at 52 Iranian sites including those of cultural importance to the Iranian people if Tehran moves to avenge the murder of Soleimani which was denounced by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as “an act of international terrorism.” Like this story?

138,None,The attack was on Camp Simba naval base in Manda Bay in Lamu County on Kenya’s coast bordering Somalia. Lamu County Commissioner Irungu Macharia told the Daily Nation local newspaper that “heavily armed” militants stormed the compound at 4am local time. Witnesses heard gunfire coming from the base Photos and videos circulating on social media allegedly show smoke billowing from the site. The spokesperson for the Defense Ministry Colonel Paul Njuguna later said that the attackers tried to seize the Manda airstrip near the base but were repulsed. Four militants were killed he stated as quoted by the Standard. There were no immediate reports of casualties among the personnel at the base or civilians. Established in 2004 Camp Simba is used by the US to train Kenyan naval units and is believed to play an important role in American operations in Somalia and Yemen including drone strikes. Kenyan troops participate in the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) which is aimed at supporting the Somalian government in its fight against Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab often carries out terrorist attacks in Kenya. In December militants ambushed a bus in the northern part of the country killing 11 people including seven police officers. One of the bloodiest attacks happened in 2013 when the group stormed a high-end shopping mall in Nairobi the nation’s capital killing more than 60 people mostly civilians.

142,None,"The solemn procession began at 7am at the Rumi Square in Ahvaz the capital of Iran's western Khuzestan Province which borders Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of black-clad mourners have completely filled both the streets and a bridge over the Karun River to pay their last respects to the major general.  Many are carrying photos of Soleimani who Iranian media has dubbed ""the Commander of Hearts."" Soleimani's remains along with those of several other Iranian officials killed in a US drone strike on Friday morning arrived in Ahvaz from Iraq where similar processions took place in Baghdad and Karbala the home of a Shia holy site. The caskets draped with Iranian flags were met by the local governor and clerics. According to the Mehr News Agency Soleimani is especially revered in Khuzestan because as a young man he participated in the defense of the region from the Iraqi invasion in the early days of the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988). Similar farewell processions are set to be held in several other cities including Tehran before Soleimani's funeral takes place in his hometown of Kerman on Tuesday. Soleimani who led the Quds Force – Iran's elite unit tasked with operations abroad – for more than 20 years was killed by a US drone shortly after leaving Baghdad's airport on Friday morning. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis the deputy chief of Iran-backed Iraqi Shia militias the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) died alongside Soleimani. The remains of al-Muhandis who was an Iranian citizen were also transported to Iran on Sunday. The US said that the killing of the Quds leader has prevented several major terrorist attacks against US army personnel and civilians. Tehran meanwhile branded Soleimani's death as a terrorist act by Washington and vowed to retaliate. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

143,None,Facing promises of retaliation for the killing of a popular Iranian general whose death he ordered personally Donald Trump threatened in no uncertain terms to escalate the conflict further. He said that if Tehran fails to turn the other cheek the US will hit 52 Iranian sites of great value. Hours later the US president returned to Twitter to brag about the amount of money the US military has received for equipment under his watch. “We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World!” he tweeted going on to promise that if attacked the US “will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way.” Friday’s targeted assassination of Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s Quds Force marked a sudden and rapid escalation of Washington’s stand-off with Iran. The US military claims the Iranian general approved an attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American. The Trump administration also justified the airstrike by accusing Soleimani of preparing an imminent attack on American citizens. Stocks of US defense contractors rose in the wake of the killing as investors predicted that there will be no shortage of US taxpayers’ money going their way if as Trump threatened their products are headed for Iran.

144,None,Following a speech delivered by Speaker Ali Larijani the MPs rose from their seats and gathered in the center of the hall to chant the anti-American slogan which is popular in Iran. “Mr. Trump this is the voice of the Iranian nation” Larijani said. The Iranian legislators are among hundreds of thousands outraged by the targeted assassination of Soleimani who was one of the most popular figures in Iran. His body was delivered on Sunday from Iraq where he was killed by a US airstrike on Friday morning. ‘Death to America’ is a slogan popularized during the 1979 revolution which ousted the US-backed Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Critics of Tehran see it as a literal call to kill Americans while Iranian officials say the chant expresses opposition to Washington’s aggressive and disruptive foreign policy.

145,None,"Trump is a 'terrorist in a suit'. He will learn history very soon that NOBODY can defeat 'the Great Iranian Nation &amp; Culture' Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi tweeted on Sunday while also comparing the US president to Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) Adolf Hitler and Mongolian conqueror Genghis Khan. The minister was responding to an earlier tweet by Trump in which he warned that the US has ""targeted 52 Iranian sites"" including those important to ""the Iranian culture"" that will be hit if Tehran attacks American citizens or assets. Iran's army chief Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi rebuffed the warning however saying it is ""unlikely that the US would have what it takes to carry out its threat."" Meanwhile Tehran summoned the Swiss envoy to the Islamic Republic to protest Trump's hostile remarks. Such aggressive language is ""completely unacceptable and violates international law"" the Iranian Foreign Ministry said. Swiss diplomats act as intermediaries between Tehran and Washington because the countries cut formal ties in 1980. Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated dramatically in recent weeks. On December 27 dozens of rockets hit K-1 Air Base in Iraq killing an American civilian contractor and wounding several servicemen. Washington blamed Iran-backed Shia group Kataib Hezbollah for the attack and conducted airstrikes on its sites in Iraq and Syria. In response to the raids the group's members and supporters staged a large protest outside the US embassy in Baghdad which ended with the protesters breaking into the compound and partially setting it on fire. On Friday morning a US drone strike killed the chief of Iran's Quds Force – an elite unit tasked with operations abroad – Major General Qassem Soleimani. The attack also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis deputy commander of the Iran-backed Shia militia the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). Tehran has harshly condemned the raid while the US claims that Soleimani's death prevented several major terrorist attacks against American nationals. The Islamic Republic’s envoy to the United Nations has asked the UN Security Council to condemn the “horrific assassination” of the Quds Force leader.

146,None,Users are supposedly not allowed to threaten violence or glorify acts of violence on Twitter. And many people believe US President Donald Trump did just that when he threatened to attack 52 Iranian sites including some of cultural significance on his Twitter account. They are calling on Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend the man in the White House for breaking the rules.  Trump’s threat follows a warning of retaliation from Iran for the targeted assassination of one of its most prominent generals which was carried out on Friday on the US president’s orders. The move marks a rapid escalation of tensions between Washington and Tehran. The news of the death of Qassem Soleimani was met with much anxiety online with hashtags related to a possible World War 3 trending globally on Twitter throughout Friday. The website of the US Selective Service System even reported service problems amid rumors of an imminent draft. While it’s highly unlikely that Twitter will make the dreams of Trump critics come true and cut off the president it seems to have done some work on managing the public debate over how to proceed. Journalist and author Yasha Levine reported that Twitter algorithms forced him to remove an image saying “No war on Iran” in block capitals and several other users said it happened to them too. Levine somewhat proudly called himself a repeat offender. A vocal critic of Silicon Valley and its cooperation with the US intelligence community he was temporarily suspended by Twitter last month for a sarcastic take on Washington’s Ukraine policy. Anti-war sentiment raged not only on Twitter but also on the streets as thousands of US citizens staged protests against the escalation of violence in several large cities on Saturday.

147,None,Raab went on the BBC to fully endorse Washington’s justification of the targeted assassination of the commander of Iran’s Quds Force as an act of self-defense. The Trump administration claimed the man was planning attacks on American citizens and that preemptively killing him on Iraqi soil was OK. “It was General Soleimani’s job description to engage proxies militias across not just Iraq but the whole region not just to destabilize those countries but to attack Western countries who were legitimately there” the top British diplomat told Andrew Marr. “In those circumstances the right of self-defense clearly applies.” Soleimani was a crucial figure in organizing military support of the governments of Syria and Iraq in their fight against Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS). The Sunni terrorist organization grew out of an Iraq-based off-shoot of Al-Qaeda that gained strength on the chaos and smuggled weapons pumped into Syria by nations bent on toppling the Syrian government before overrunning US-trained Iraqi troops in the 2014 lightning offensive. The US and a coalition of its allies including Britain too fought IS on both sides of the border. Noticeably the fighting in Syria was done without a mandate of the UN Security Council and in blatant disregard for the opinion of the government in Damascus. American troops remain in the east of the country controlling oil fields and denying access to Syrians. In the drive to vilify Soleimani US President Trump branded him as the “number one terrorist anywhere in the world” – a title presumably ‘bestowed’ on the man after the killing of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi last October. Vice President Mike Pence went further and falsely accused the Iranian general of having a hand in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Soleimani’s actual record is quite complicated and includes for example assisting the US in their fight against the Taliban before George W. Bush put Iran on his  “axis of evil” list.

148,None,"The non-binding resolution instructs the government to cancel a request for military assistance from the US-led coalition which was issued in response to the rise of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS). With IS supposedly defeated Iraq will not need foreign troops to fight the jihadists and can close its airspace to coalition aircraft. According to Press TV some Western military presence may remain for training purposes. The resolution says Iraqi military leadership has to report the number of foreign instructors that are necessary for Iraqi national security. At the same time the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said that Baghdad had turned to the UN Security Council with complaints about US violations of its sovereignty. Speaking at an emergency parliament session on Sunday Iraq’s caretaker PM Adil Abdul Mahdi said the American side notified the Iraqi military about the planned airstrike minutes before it was carried out. He stressed that his government denied Washington permission to continue with the operation. Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s Quds Force and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis the deputy commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Force were killed by a drone strike as their convoy was leaving Baghdad International Airport on Friday morning.Mahdi said Soleimani was on his way to meet him. The interim prime minister said after the incident it was clear that it was in the interest of both the US and Iraq to end the presence of foreign forces on Iraqi soil. Responding to the move the Trump administration has expressed “disappointment” over the outcome of the vote by the Iraqi MPs. State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus urged Baghdad to reconsider taking into account ""the importance of the ongoing economic and security relationship” between Iraq and the US. The decision by the Iraqi Parliament is an “enormous development” not only for the country but for the whole region political analyst and journalist Andre Vltchek believes but removing foreign troops might be more difficult.  “We never saw the US army to depart just because the parliament of the occupied country would vote that it should. So this is not going to be easy for Iraq to get rid of the US and NATO military” Vltchek told RT. Washington is likely to “do all sorts of tricks” to try and stay in Iraq. For instance the US might “move the troops to Iraqi Kurdistan – as they did in the past.” Still the situation in the region now is different Vltchek added and the death of Soleimani may have become a unifying moment for it – at least for the countries and groups that maintain certain relations with Iran. Influential Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr stated in a letter that Iraq should go further and shut down the US embassy. Washington claims the assassination of Soleimani was an act of self-defense justified by his planning of attacks on American citizens. Tehran called it international terrorism and vowed to avenge the popular military officer. In the wake of the attack the US advised all American civilians to leave Iraq. US-led coalition troops in Iraq have also suspended all training operations and hunkered down at fortified bases bracing for retaliatory strikes.

149,None,A frustrated Masako Mori announced on Sunday that she had instructed the nation’s immigration services “to coordinate with related agencies to further tighten departure procedures.” “It is clear that we do not have records of the defendant Ghosn departing Japan” Mori said stressing that the former chairman and CEO of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance jumped bail and traveled from the airport in Osaka to Beirut Lebanon by using “some wrongful methods.” Mori also confirmed that Ghosn’s bail had been revoked after which Interpol had issued a non-binding ‘wanted’ notice to detain the fugitive on Tokyo’s request.  In Japan Ghosn is charged with embezzlement and lying about the size of his salary to shareholders. He was arrested and sacked from his positions then released on bail and placed under house arrest. He fled Japan on December 29 and reached Beirut via Istanbul the next day. Many details of the businessman’s daring escape remain unclear. There were reports that he managed to ditch surveillance by being smuggled out in a large box for musical instruments. However investigative sources later told Japanese public broadcaster NHK that surveillance footage had actually shown Ghosn leaving his Tokyo home and never returning. Furthermore citing sources Sankei newspaper reported on Saturday that the ex-CEO fled on the day when a private security company hired by Nissan stopped monitoring Ghosn because his lawyers threatened the firm with a lawsuit. Japanese media also reported that the escape was aided by a former Green Beret with experience in extracting hostages. The businessman who is a Brazilian French and Lebanese national reportedly left on a private jet using his spare French passport. Ghosn who denies the allegations against him explained that he chose to flee Japan because he does not trust the “rigged” local justice system. Although shocked by Ghosn’s escape his chief lawyer Takashi Takano said the authorities violated his client’s right to see his wife and that Ghosn was worried about not getting a fair trial due to the prosecutors’ leaks to the media and had feared that the legal process may take years. Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan. Lebanese caretaker Justice Minister Albert Serhan told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper that the country has no plans to hand over Ghosn despite having received a notice from Interpol asking them to detain him. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor’s Office meanwhile stated on Sunday that the ex-CEO “knowingly flouted” Japan’s judicial procedures while his “abundant financial power and multiple foreign bases” made it easy for him to flee the country. The prosecutors maintain that Ghosn must be detained to order to ensure “fair and appropriate criminal proceedings” and there is a “realistic danger” of him destroying evidence in the case.

150,None,Reading a prepared statement to his cabinet on Sunday Netanyahu lauded the importance of a subsea gas pipeline that will connect Israel with Cyprus and Greece. A trilateral agreement on the project was signed during his trip to Athens this week. “The significance of this project is that we are turning Israel into a nuclear power” he said before quickly correcting himself to say “energy power” and acknowledging his mistake with a smile.    Israel is estimated to hold about 90 nuclear warheads in its arsenal and a wide range of delivery systems. It is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which only recognizes five nuclear powers – the US Russia China Britain and France. In that regard Israel is in the company of India Pakistan and North Korea. The gaffe coming from the seasoned politician was seized by his critics online who mocked Netanyahu.

151,None,"The US will continue to “respond with lawful strikes” targeting “actual decision makers” if it perceives a danger to any American targets the secretary of state said. The remarks came as he continued to defend the assassination of Iranian Quds Force commander Major General Qassem Soleimani which was ordered by President Donald Trump. Pompeo maintained that Washington had “all the authority” to do what it had done but added that the White House would keep Congress informed about developments in the Middle East from now on. His view on the “legality” of the American strikes on Iraqi soil was clearly not shared by Baghdad which even filed a formal complaint over the incident with the UN secretary general and the UN Security Council. He also argued that the killing of Soleimani which sent shockwaves across both Iran and Iraq with thousands of people hitting the streets to mourn the slain general and condemn the measures taken by the US was still the best course of action. ""The intelligence assessment made clear that no action - allowing Soleimani to continue his plotting and his planning his terror campaign - created more risk than taking the action that we took last week"" the state secretary told ABC’s ‘This Week’. In an apparent attempt to calm things down a bit Pompeo also said that he had “no doubt” the Iranian leadership “understands” Trump’s view of the situation and “gets the message clearly.” So far however the attack has only raised hostilities between Washington and Tehran to a whole new level. Iran called the American strike “an act of international terrorism” and vowed revenge. Both sides are now trading threats with a senior commander of Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards Corps claiming that up to 35 “vital” US and Israeli targets are within Iran’s reach while Trump threatened to strike 52 Iranian sites should Tehran follow up on its revenge plans - adding later that “brand new” American military hardware worth trillions of dollars would head Iran’s way in the event of retaliatory action.

Others expressed outrage of a different kind perplexed that people could get worked up over a breakfast sandwich while so many in the world deal with life-threatening situations. “Australia is ablaze; The US president is starting a war with Iran; but hang on...

154,None,Iraqi resistance will not let a single US soldier stay in Iraq after the killing of the Iranian Quds force commander Nasrallah said in a televised speech on Sunday. The Hezbollah leader however warned against harming any American civilians as such acts will only play into the hands of US President Donald Trump adding that every US military asset and serviceman in the region is fair game. “When the coffins of American soldiers and officers begin to be transported ... to the United States Trump and his administration will realize that they have really lost the region and will lose the elections” Nasrallah said. Expulsion of the US from the whole Middle East is a fair price for the murder of Soleimani and other officials Nasrallah said issuing a rather grim threat to the US military. The suicide bombers who had forced America to leave before are still there – and now they are greater in numbers he added. Avenging the deaths of Soleimani and other high-ranking Iranian and Iraqi military officials including Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis the deputy commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Force (PMF) militia is the responsibility of not only Iran but of all its allies in the region.

155,None,"Iran’s nuclear program “no longer faces any operating restrictions” a government statement cited by Iranian media said adding that parameters of enrichment capacity enrichment level and the amount of enriched material would from now on be determined only by the program’s “technical needs.” Tehran still vowed to continue its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and said that it could potentially return to fulfilling its obligations under the nuclear deal if sanctions imposed by Washington are lifted and Tehran’s interests are respected. The move marks the fifth and the final step in Tehran’s gradual scaling down of its commitments under the deal. The measure was taken in response to America’s unilateral exit from the agreement last year which was followed by its reissuing of crippling sanctions against Iran. Washington’s European allies desperately sought to preserve the deal struck in 2015 between Iran France Germany the UK and the US as well as Russia and China. Europe even attempted to create a special-purpose vehicle called INSTEX intended to help European companies trade with Iran without fear of repercussions in the form of sanctions from across the Atlantic. It turned out to be not particularly effective however as the European companies appeared to be in no rush to trade with Iran through fear of losing American market. Tehran repeatedly criticized Europe for failing to fulfil its commitments under the accord. It’s high time for Europe to make itself clear on the matter and either side with Washington or make a decisive push to salvage the beleaguered deal Ammar Waqqaf Middle East analyst told RT. “Iran is now pushing Europe towards the edge in terms of having either rescue the nuclear deal and part ways with America or probably ditch the deal altogether but it won’t be an Iranian call it would probably be a European call” Waqqaf said arguing that Europeans “have to act now.” Despite the current flare-up Tehran leaves the door open for compromise and the ball is now in the US court he said. “We are still hearing voices coming out from Tehran saying “guys we are happy to de-escalate and call it off should you lift sanctions.” The tensions between Iran and the US can spiral into a military conflict considering the both countries “are on the edge both have capabilities and both of them can hurt each other” Ahmed Rushdi President of House of Iraqi Expertise Foundation noted expressing hope that Tehran ""won't take a harsh decision"" and would pursue a “balanced” approach in handling the crisis.

157,None,The Turkish military has already started moving “slowly” towards Libya Erdogan revealed late Sunday. The scope of Ankara’s involvement in the years-long conflict is still unknown. The deployment of Turkish troops was greenlighted by the country’s parliament on Thursday. The move followed a request for military assistance by Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj who heads the UN-backed Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA). The GNA is entangled in a years-long conflict with another body claiming to be the real government of the shattered country – the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR). The HoR is supported by a major military force – Libyan National Army (LNA) led by strongman Khalifa Haftar. The LNA launched a large assault against the GNA early in 2019 reaching the outskirts of Tripoli but failing to actually storm the capital. The offensive seemingly picked up pace back in December when Haftar announced a new push for the capital. Turkey’s decision has drawn the ire of the GNA’s rivals – Haftar declared ‘jihad’ against Turkey vowing to throw the “invaders” out of the country. The HoR stuck to more conventional diplomatic actions officially cutting all ties with Ankara and accusing the rival PM of treason. Turkey is playing a high-stakes game in Libya with very little chance of success Ayo Johnson journalist and founder of Viewpoint Africa told RT noting that the promise of control over Libya’s vast oil and natural gas resources is too tempting for Ankara to not give it a shot even though Haftar “has the swing of the pendulum” and can take Tripoli “at a moment’s notice.” “When you are talking about oil when you talking about natural gas the sort of volume the largest we’ve seen on the African continent you can understand why so many actors and players are at play.” Although the US has not openly sided with either of the two rival Libyan governments urging all parties to show restraint and sounding the alarm over Russia’s growing influence in the region Johnson said he believes the Turkish offensive will come in handy for the US. “I understand from the sources I’ve been in contact with that they are already supporting the Turkish effort to be in Libya just to make sure that Russians and other supportive factions on the other side do not [lay] claim to that land in any shape or form” Johnson said. Still he said he believes the odds that the GNA will prevail are miniscule despite being backed by the UN. “I think [GNA PM Fayez Mustafa] al-Sarraj has a factional opportunity of winning but it’s going to be very difficult… I cannot see physically how which is why he has been propped up and supported by the Turks.” Think your friends would be interested?

One more hit the neighboring district of Jadriya. There have been no reports of any casualties or damage resulting from the attack. It is the second such incident targeting the Green Zone in just a few days since a top Iranian commander was killed on orders from Washington. On Saturday at least two rockets also hit the area not far from the American diplomatic mission. Mortar shells also landed in a nearby city district injuring five people at that time.

The incidents come after Major General Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force was killed in a US drone strike alongside a deputy commander of an Iraqi Shia militia and a dozen other people. The strike sent shockwaves across both Iran and Iraq where thousands of people took to the streets to mourn the dead and condemn Washington’s actions.

The general promised to “pursue those responsible” for the attack and prevent Al-Shabaab jihadists from creating a “safe haven” in Africa.  The attack on the military base included “indirect and small arms fire.” Though the jihadists made it through the perimeter they were repelled by forces within the base. Six contractor aircraft vehicles were damaged “to some degree” in the attack.  Established in 2004 Camp Simba is used by the US to train Kenyan naval units and is believed to play an important role in American operations in Somalia and Yemen including drone strikes. Kenyan troops participate in the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) which is aimed at supporting the Somalian government in its fight against Al-Shabaab a jihadist group based in East Africa. In a recent attack the militant group ambushed a bus in December and killed 11 people including seven police officers. The US government designated al-Shabaab a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2008.  Think your friends would be interested?

160,None,A resolution calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops was adopted by the Iraqi parliament on Sunday. The non-binding document which the government is yet to consider came in response to the assassination of Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani as well as other Iranian and Iraqi military officials including the deputy commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The high-profile officials were killed in a US airstrike on the outskirts of Baghdad earlier this week. Washington appeared unnerved by the resolution. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the American military presence in the country insisting that the Iraqis actually support it. “We are confident that the Iraqi people want the United States to continue to be there to fight the counterterror campaign” Pompeo told Fox News Sunday. He apparently missed the part where the US actually attacked the Iraqi forces. The PMF militia which has been the key force in fighting Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) is part of the country’s military author and analyst Nicolas J.S. Davies said. “There’s now a confrontation between the Iraqi government and the US government. The US has already attacked Iraq’s armed forces that’s how this began” Davies told RT. “The Iraqi government has every right to ask them to leave and if the US resists this request then we have a huge confrontation.” The killing of Soleimani and his associates came not only in blatant disregard of international norms but breached the deal between Baghdad and Washington Davies said; thus the latest move by Iraq’s parliament is not very surprising. “The US is really just behaving like a rogue state at this point. All of it is just a flagrant violation of international law in so many ways” he said adding that US troops are there at the invitation of the Iraqi government. The parliament’s decision is an “enormous development” for the country which has moved a step closer to ending the enduring occupation as well as for the whole region political analyst and journalist Andre Vltchek believes. “We never saw the US Army depart just because the parliament of the occupied country would vote that it should. So this is not going to be easy for Iraq to get rid of the US and NATO military” Vltchek told RT. Washington is likely to employ “all sorts of tricks” to try and stay in the country he said. Transferring its forces into the autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan region “as they did in the past” is one way. Still the situation in the region has changed since the early stages of the 2003 invasion and the local powers and groups seem to be showing significantly more unity and the death of Soleimani could end up being a unifying moment. The whole endeavor to try and expel US troops from Iraq might still flop former Pentagon official Michael Maloof cautioned since the country’s politicians – including the caretaker PM who is spearheading the effort now – were very reluctant to actually do so before the US attack. “Prior to the assassination of General Soleimani there was dissent within these Shia ranks and that’s why you had no decision because for months there has been discussion of doing just this – possibly removing foreign troops namely the US in particular to avoid the very problem we’re having now” he said. The local forces have already been deemed capable of tackling the existing terrorist threat on their own – and now the US troops are “basically booted out” instead of departing after an accomplished mission Maloof said. “Now the question is – if ordered out will the US forces leave? … If they do not then they’ll become an occupying force once again.” Like this story?

161,None,The president minced no words as he continued to threaten Tehran with a swift and potentially devastating response as the two nations have found themselves on the brink of a military conflict after the US killed a top Iranian commander on a direct order from the White House. This time however he did not just issue another threat but also said that the US Congress should follow his Twitter to keep up with the latest developments of this potentially explosive situation. “These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target the United States will quickly &amp; fully strike back &amp; perhaps in a disproportionate manner” Trump tweeted. “Such legal notice is not required but is given nevertheless!” The US State Secretary Mike Pompeo told ABC’s ‘This Week’ earlier on Sunday that although Washington had “all the authority” to strike the Iranian general it would try and keep Congress informed about its plans from now on. He never mentioned it would be done in the form of Twitter feed though. Trump himself has meanwhile been busy issuing threats to Tehran after Iran called the killing of Qassem Soleimani the commander of the elite Quds Force an “act of international terrorism” and vowed revenge. The US president warned that 52 Iranian targets including some apparently important cultural sites could be hit in a retaliation strike should Tehran follow up on its revenge plans. Pompeo later denied this statement. Trump also said that “brand new” American military hardware worth trillions of dollars would head Iran’s way in the event of retaliatory action. Back at home Trump was heavily criticized by the Democrats including senators and 2020 hopefuls Joe Biden Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders as well House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who is leading the impeachment process against him. They all warned it would bring Washington closer to war with Tehran. Trump’s Republican allies on the contrary welcomed the move and sided with the president and the secretary of state in calling it a preemptive defensive. Like this story?

162,None,This week the court will hear a case brought by the mother of a 15-year-old patient at the Tavistock Clinic in Leeds  – identified only as “Mrs. A” – and Sue Evans who worked there as a mental health nurse between 2003 and 2007. Both accuse the state-sponsored child gender reassignment center of providing an “inaccurate and potentially misleading” picture about the risks of such life-changing treatment to their young patients and their parents.  The plaintiffs argue that such medical intervention cannot be performed with only a child’s consent claiming that the clinic’s patients cannot fully comprehend the consequences of such life-changing decisions. “We are essentially seeking to say that the provision at the Tavistock for young people up to the age of 18 is illegal because there isn’t valid consent” said Paul Conrathe a lawyer representing the plaintiffs. Such treatment should not be delivered “as a matter of general approach” but instead should require a court order in each case he told the Guardian. The Tavistock Clinic’s methods have already attracted controversy particularly due to the criticism of its Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) by former employees who accuse it of “over-diagnosing” children with gender dysphoria to subject them to what some are calling risky and experimental treatment. As many as 35 psychologists have resigned from GIDS over the last three years with some of them raising concerns about the clinic’s practices. “Our fears are that young people are being over-diagnosed and then over-medicalized” one of them told Sky News in mid-December. “We are extremely concerned about the consequences for young people… For those of us who previously worked in the service we fear that we have had front row seats to a medical scandal.” The clinic generally treats children and teenagers under the age of 18. At least half of them are subjected to therapy that can have severe adverse health effects according to the Telegraph. First they are prescribed hormone-blockers that halt puberty and could generally slow normal physical development to supposedly give children “time to consider” if they really want to go through the transition process. The next stage is hormone therapy which leads to irreversible changes in the human body and eventually makes those taking hormones infertile while interfering with normal hormone production. Finally when patients reach the age of 18 they can go through gender reassignment surgery. The number of children going through GIDS has risen by a whopping 30 times over the last decade from 77 patients a year in 2008 to almost 3000 in 2018 according to the Tavistock Clinic’s own figures. Yet psychologists who used to work at the clinic warn that the center may be too eager to force a certain agenda instead of really dealing with the problems its patients have. “At the moment there’s only one pathway through the service which is a medical pathway not a psychological one” one of them told Sky News. Medical specialists who have left the clinic added that psychologists working there were kept under constant pressure because of fear of being called “transphobic.” “I didn’t feel able to voice my concerns or when I did I was often shut down by other affirmative clinicians” one of them told Sky. “Looking back there are young people who I now wouldn’t necessarily put on medication.” The GIDS which is controlled by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust brushed off concerns voiced by its former employees by saying that it supports every young person on a case-by-case basis as well as allows its specialists to discuss any case and “to engage openly and supportively with patients and parents.” The issues however may not be limited to just one clinic across the UK. In late December the Times reported that the number of children referred to a gender reassignment clinic in Glasgow Scotland has soared recently with referrals of patients aged between four and 10 skyrocketing by 80 percent in just over one year.  Trina Budge co-founder of local NGO forwomen.scot expressed alarm that children in Scotland might not receive sufficient support before being presented with the surgical option.  “Very vulnerable children who may be confused about their sexuality be autistic suffered trauma or have other co-morbid mental health conditions are at risk of being sent down an irreversible and experimental medical pathway when psychological support and talking therapy may be more appropriate” she said.

163,None,The goal of serving an en vogue meatless menu to guests before the televised ceremony is to “send a signal” about the potential dangers of climate change.  “If there’s a way we can not change the world but save the planet maybe we can get the Golden Globes to send a signal and draw attention to the issue about climate change” Hollywood Foreign Press Association president Lorenzo Soria said in a statement. “The food we eat the way we grow the food we eat the way we dispose of the food is one of the large contributors to the climate crisis.” Entree items include king oyster mushrooms scallops and wild mushroom risotto. Brussel sprouts and carrots will also be served and a golden beet soup will be the evening’s appetizer.   There is no official word on whether the food was produced locally or what was used to deliver it but Matthew Morgan executive chef at The Beverly Hilton which is where the ceremony takes place said the dishes were already mostly available. They were simply vegan options in the past and Morgan simply enhanced the dishes for the new slimmer menu. The red carpet at the event will also be reused at other events and water will be served in reusable glass bottles.  The decision to change the menu was made two weeks before the telecast was set to air. Climate change activist and actor Leonardo DiCaprio — who is up for the Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy award for his work in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood — praised the HFPA on Twitter for their climate friendly decision. Others were not so celebratory of the decision and saw it as an example of empty and hypocritical activism out of Hollywood considering the Golden Globes will still take a toll on the environment thanks to the many after-parties and gas-fueled limousine rides to and from the ceremony. “This will stop all of China’s pollution good job everybody” commentator Dana Loesch tweeted. “It will be interesting to see what modes of transportation will be used to travel to said event... Golden Globes meals going meatless to raise environmental awareness” The Hill reporter Joe Concha added.  “It’d be even more environmentally friendly if they just tweeted a list of winners” another user wrote. Hollywood award ceremonies are often platforms for virtue-signaling politics. Last year many celebrities attended the Golden Globes wearing Time’s Up pins in support of the #MeToo movement which affected many people within the industry. Both men and women wore the pins including actor James Franco who has faced several allegations of sexual misconduct.  That same year many female guests wore black outfits to protest the apparent power imbalance in the industry between men and women. “I think people are aware now of a power imbalance and it's something that leads to abuse it has led to abuse in our own industry. We want to fix that and we feel emboldened in a thick black line dividing then from now” actress Meryl Streep who wore black to the ceremony told Harper’s Bazaar.

164,None,“We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that’s there. It cost billions of dollars to build long before my time. We’re not leaving unless they pay us back for it” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. The punitive measures that the US is ready to slap on its supposed ally in the fight against Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) will be even harsher than the crippling sanctions already in effect against Tehran the president said. Trump’s warning to Iraq comes after Iraqi MPs passed a non-binding resolution championed by the country’s caretaker prime minister asking the Iraqi government to expel foreign troops by cancelling a request for military assistance from the US-led coalition. The resolution adopted earlier on Sunday envisions that some foreign troops might stay in Iraq for training purposes but the number of foreign instructors deemed necessary should be reported back by the Iraqi authorities. Trump also doubled down on his threat to wipe out Iranian cultural sites in retaliation for potential future attacks from Tehran which has vowed to avenge the assassination of its top general Qassem Soleimani by the US. Accusing Iran of “torturing” and “maiming” American soldiers in suicide attacks and by planting roadside bombs Trump hinted that attacks on US troops justify potential war crimes – the destruction of a nation’s cultural heritage. “They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way.” Trump’s statement on Saturday that the US might fire upon 52 sites that are important to Iran’s people and culture has courted controversy in the US with many of the Trump administration’s critics noting that Washington would mimic the methods of its declared adversary Islamic State – which is notorious for damaging and destroying globally-significant cultural sites in Syria and Iraq. Tensions between the US and Iran have been mounting ever since a series of US airstrikes against the Shia Kataib Hezbollah militia in Syria and Iraq on December 29 killed at least 25 fighters triggering a siege of the US Embassy in Baghdad that saw demonstrators chanting “death to America” and setting checkpoints on fire. The US blamed the showdown at its diplomatic compound on Tehran and its “proxies.” On Thursday the US launched a drone strike at a convoy travelling near Baghdad International Airport killing Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Qassem Soleimani along with senior Iraqi militia leaders. The murder of Soleimani who played a key role in the fight against IS in Syria and Iraq has drawn outrage across Iran and Iraq with Tehran vowing to avenge the assassination calling it “an act of international terrorism.” Washington meanwhile insists that Soleimani was the mastermind behind a spate of attacks on American personnel including at the US Embassy and says he was plotting new assaults.

165,None,The opposition-led National Assembly changed guard on Sunday with the majority of lawmakers electing Luis Parra an MP from the centrist Justice First a party in opposition to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s United Socialist Party (PSUV). One of the absentees was US-backed opposition figurehead Juan Guaido the now ex-leader of the National Assembly who proclaimed himself the country’s ‘interim president’ a year ago. Guaido and a group of his henchmen were filmed attempting to climb a fence surrounding the legislature with uniformed security guards pulling them back. The video has spread like wildfire online and was picked up by mainstream media in the West which spun it as evidence of Guaido being barred from participating in the key parliamentary vote by the supposedly ‘sinister’ Maduro ‘regime.’ But there’s a twist. Other footage shows Guaido chatting with members of the National Guard and refusing to enter the premises unless his companions reportedly five other deputies who were stripped of parliamentary immunity pending criminal prosecution are allowed inside. After his plea was rejected Guaido reportedly raised hell and attempted to storm the building. After his gambit failed Guaido convened a parallel assembly at an office of the pro-opposition El Nacional newspaper. His supporters “re-elected” Guaido and ‘swore him in’ as the parliament’s leader proclaiming the recent National Assembly vote unlawful. Some say that Guaido had the newspaper’s office ready for the ceremony long before he threw his fit at the fence suggesting this was nothing more than a publicity stunt.  That didn’t stop some top political figures – like the US secretary of state and Bolivia’s self-declared interim president Jeanin Anez – from congratulating Guaido on his ‘re-election’ while taking aim at Caracas for allegedly impeding his access to the building. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza denounced the stunt as yet another attempt by the US “to impose fake governments” after the “resounding failure” of its “coup strategy” in 2019.

166,None,“We promise to continue martyr Soleimani’s path with the same force... and the only compensation for us would be to remove America from the region” Esmail Qaani said on Monday in an interview to local media ahead of the general’s funeral in Tehran. Qaani was appointed new leader of the Quds Force – the secretive arm of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – on January 3. His comments come just days after General Gholamali Abuhamzeh who heads the IRGC in Iran’s southern Kerman province said 35 US targets in the region as well as Tel Aviv were identified “long ago” and are “within our reach.” Washington responded with a similarly-worded message with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threatening “lawful strikes” targeting “actual decision makers” if any American asset is in danger. As the war of words escalated the Pentagon ordered 3000 troops into the region. Meanwhile Iraq’s parliament passed a resolution calling for the removal of foreign troops from the country. Quds Force commander General Soleimani was assassinated in a targeted US drone strike near Baghdad International Airport. His car was hit when local allies from Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) were driving him from the airport. After days of mourning he will be buried in his hometown Kerman on Tuesday.

167,None,“Crazy Trump don’t think that everything is over with my father’s martyrdom” Zeinab Soleimani said in an address broadcast on state television amid a mourning ceremony in Tehran. The US rejoiced at General Soleimani’s assassination earlier in the week with Trump saying it helped foil “imminent and sinister” attacks on US diplomats and personnel. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed the strike which killed Soleimani near a Baghdad airport also averted an unspecified “big action” that would have put “dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk.” Tehran called the killing “an act of terrorism” and vowed “a rigorous response” once Soleimani is laid to rest. Commemorative ceremonies for the general who led the Quds Force for over two decades since 1998 saw people stomping on and burning American and Israeli flags. Think your friends would be interested?

He also called on Washington and Tehran to show restraint and avoid an escalation of tensions in the wake of a US drone strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force. “Power politics are neither popular nor sustainable” Shuang added as quoted by Reuters. China has been highly critical of the targeted strike describing the assassination as a violation of international norms and deeply damaging to regional stability. In a telephone conversation with his Iranian counterpart Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Washington was “abusing force” and promised that Beijing will hold an objective and fair position in order to help improve the situation in the Middle East.

173,None,The first week of the year saw more bad news coming in with Iran saying it will cease sticking to limitations on enrichment levels of enrichment and the stock of uranium written down in the 2015 nuclear deal. The announcement apparently unnerved Germany one of the three European countries that have been trying to save the deal after Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to pull the US out of it in May 2018. “We will definitely talk to Iran again” Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Deutschlandfunk radio on Monday. He said Iran’s actions are “not consistent with the agreement” and could lead to a calamitous outcome. “No one wants Iran to come closer to obtaining nuclear weapons” the top diplomat stated. Maas added that “we as Europe” will make a contribution to ensure that every opportunity is used “to give diplomacy another chance.” As part of the 2015 accords Iran conceded to limit its nuclear activities especially enriching uranium – a key element used to produce a nuclear weapon – and allow international inspections in return for the lifting of sweeping economic sanctions. But Trump’s withdrawal from the deal saw Iran gradually scaling back its commitments under the agreement. Throughout 2019 it had been activating new centrifuges and enriching uranium to levels banned under the agreement. Tehran was expected to announce its latest stance on the agreement just before a US drone strike near Baghdad killed General Qassem Soleimani the longtime commander of the Quds Force the secretive part of Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.  The targeted assassination has raised the ire of Iraqi leadership who bluntly said it violated the country’s sovereignty. Local MPs passed a resolution calling for a complete withdrawal of foreign forces to which the White House responded by threatening penalties that would “make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.” To Maas such threats “are not helpful” given the tensions that flared up in the region. “I don't think that it is possible with threats to convince Iraq but with arguments” he told Deutschlandfunk.

174,None,In a letter to her Democratic colleagues Pelosi stressed that Congress had a “responsibility” to stop a “serious escalation” with Tehran that could endanger US diplomats and service members. She said the House will introduce a vote on a War Powers resolution later this week that aims to “limit the President’s military actions regarding Iran.” The bill “reasserts Congress’s long-established oversight responsibilities by mandating that if no further Congressional action is taken the Administration’s military hostilities with regard to Iran cease within 30 days.” The top-ranking Democrat said the resolution was necessary in order to reassert Congressional oversight over war powers especially since Trump did not consult lawmakers before carrying out a drone strike that killed Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force. Trump notified Congress on Sunday that he would “quickly and fully strike back and perhaps in a disproportionate manner” should Tehran strike “any person or target”. The US president also warned that “brand new” American military hardware worth trillions of dollars would head Iran’s way in the event of retaliatory action. Like this story?

175,None,The data released by the High Pay Centre think tank reveals that the average FTSE 100 chief executive is paid 117 times more than the median worker at £3.46m a year. By 5pm BST on January 6 bosses of the UK’s biggest companies will have hoovered up more than the £29559 annual salary earned by the median full-time employee. Tim Roache the general secretary of the GMB one of Britain’s largest unions branded the FTSE 100 CEOs as “fat cats” and hit out at the figures as “a source of national shame.”  Frances O’Grady general secretary of the TUC which represents the majority of trade unions insisted that the huge gap between the top and average earners in UK firms “tells you everything about how unfair our economy is.” O’Grady wants to see workers on pay committees and company boards to keep a check on the high salaries of top bosses. The pay gap issue between company bosses and workers has rumbled on over many years and is one that successive UK governments have failed to even acknowledge through policy until now.

176,None,The remains of Qassem Soleimani the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force who was killed in a US air strike was flown to Tehran after a day of funeral processions in Ahvaz and Mashhad. Bodies of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis the deputy chief of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) and other “martyrs” who died alongside Soleimani in an American drone strike also arrived in the city.  On Sunday morning a sea of people dressed in black poured onto the streets of the capital with state media putting the number of mourners at “millions” although the number has yet to be verified.  Later in the day funeral prayers were conducted by the sitting Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in the unfinished grand mosque of Tehran named after Ayatollah Khomeini. Khamenei’s voice was sobbing as he recited verses from the Koran together with President Hassan Rouhani and top officials. Esmail Qaani who succeeded Soleimani as the commander of the Quds Force was also seen choking back tears as he knelt before Soleimani’s coffin which had been draped in the national flag. Men and women of all ages were also filmed crying while others were seen holding pictures of the late commander. Mourners passed his coffin over their heads with numerous “death to America” and “down with USA” chants heard in the crowds. Soleimani’s daughter Zeinab joined the cries of vengeance telling the crowds: “Crazy [Donald] Trump don’t think that everything is over with my father’s martyrdom.” She said that a “dark day” awaits the US and Israel after the death of her father. Monday’s procession saw a number of American and Israeli flags burned by furious mourners. Some in Iran’s leadership have used the most remarkable pictures from the ceremony to send a bold message to Donald Trump who called Soleimani Iran’s “terrorist leader.”  “Have you EVER seen such a sea of humanity in your life?” asked Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif adding that the “end of malign US presence in West Asia has begun.” Following Monday’s procession the general’s remains will be taken to Qom one of the holiest cities for Shia Islam before being buried in his hometown of Kerman on Tuesday.Soleimani a designer of Iran's clandestine and military operations overseas is the first dignitary in modern history to have received a funeral ceremony in several cities across Iran. The late general rose to prominence during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and was appointed chief of the Quds Force in 1998.

177,None,"Shortly before 7pm local time on Sunday locals noticed a rather foreboding cloud heading straight for the city of Rio Cuarto. Temperatures fell dramatically and darkness descended as residents fled the sudden downpour of hail and debris. The violent dust storm enveloped the city in minutes bringing with it downpours of up to 37mm of rain in some areas as well as hail. Nearby communities in Serrano and Buchardo experienced rainfall measuring 40mm. Unfortunate residents received only a vague warning of incoming ""isolated storms of varying intensity"" which might involve “powerful gusts heavy rainfall for brief periods of time intense electrical activity and hail."" Judging by eyewitness videos from Rio Cuarto the National Meteorological Service's more pessimistic predictions were spot on. The region had experienced temperatures of 30 degrees Celsius earlier on Sunday before things took a dark turn. There were widespread - but short-lived - power cuts owing to the extreme weather which included gusts of up to 120kph.  As one eyewitness video shows even in General Levalle 125 km from Rio Cuarto roofs were torn from buildings and nonchalantly launched into the air. Miraculously there were no fatalities or injuries despite Mother Nature throwing everything at the region in a short space of time. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

179,None,In the aftermath of the assassination of Iran’s Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani in a US drone airstrike near Baghdad International Airport on Thursday night Trump announced a number of threats against the Iranians via social media. In one such threat the US president talked about “targeting” Iranian sites the number of which represents the “52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago.”  However on Monday Johnson’s official spokesman insisted that “there are international conventions in place that prevent the destruction of cultural heritage.” He stopped short of saying the killing of Soleimani was a ‘war crime’ claiming instead “states have a right to take actions such as this in self-defense.” The US administration justified the action against the man widely regarded as the second most powerful figure in Iran – after the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – by claiming Soleimani was plotting imminent attacks against American diplomats and military personnel. In response to the killing the UK ordered its navy vessels to provide “protection” to all British-flagged ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf near Iran.

180,None,The removal of foreign military forces would prevent the US-led coalition from continuing its “vital work” countering Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) in Iraq a UK government spokesman argued. Iraq’s parliament passed the motion on Sunday following the US-ordered assassination of Qassem Soleimani the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force in Baghdad. The resolution is non-binding and has not yet been adopted as an official law. The UK currently has an estimated 400 troops stationed in Iraq. London has defended President Donald Trump’s decision to use a targeted drone strike to kill Soleimani while also calling for restraint from both sides. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab reportedly told Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi that the Iranian general was a “regional menace” and said the United States had the “right of self-defense”. Trump has said US troops will not leave Iraq until Baghdad compensates Washington for military bases it has built since the start of the 2003 invasion. He vowed to impose crippling sanctions on Iraq if the US military is forced to leave on unfriendly terms. Like this story?

181,None,Videos show collapsed homes in the aftermath of the 5.8-magnitude tremor as well as roads covered in rocks and debris – apparently the result of a mudslide. In one clip a crushed car can be seen underneath a raised home whose foundation gave out.  Angel Vazquez emergency management director for the southern coastal city of Ponce told the Associated Press that some parts of the island were suffering from power outages. “This is one of the strongest quakes to date since it started shaking on December 28” he said. “It lasted a long time.” Puerto Rico's southern region has suffered a string of smaller quakes ranging in magnitude from 4.7 to 5.1 since late December. It’s unclear whether anyone was seriously injured by Monday’s larger earthquake. Officials said there was no tsunami threat. Like this story?

182,None,The team from Montana State University targeted dwarf galaxies which are 100 times less massive than our own Milky Way for study as these are the smallest known to possibly host black holes. Given the size of the galaxies it follows that their black holes would also be relatively small though still somewhere in the region of 400000 times the mass of our sun. The team began by surveying galaxies in the NASA-Sloan Atlas a catalog of readily visible galaxies before cross-referencing potential candidates with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) survey to form a candidate list of 111 galaxies.  Using the National Science Foundation's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) the team discovered 13 such black holes in dwarf galaxies less than a billion light years away. However these massive predatory black holes were found to be roving around their galaxies and consuming surrounding material such as stars planets and moons as opposed to remaining stationary at the galaxy’s center. This indicates that the galaxies likely merged with others in the past and leads to the rather terrifying conclusion that there may be far more black holes wandering out there than we thought consuming everything in their path.  “This work has taught us that we must broaden our searches for massive black holes in dwarf galaxies beyond their centers to get a more complete understanding of the population and learn what mechanisms helped form the first massive black holes in the early universe” said Amy Reines of Montana State University.

183,None,The rollback on uranium enrichment constraints detailed in the landmark international agreement “in itself poses no threat in terms of proliferation of nuclear weapons” the ministry said in a statement. The fact that Iran is acting in “close cooperation and under supervision” of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should eliminate all concerns it added. The Iranian move must be viewed in the context of the US’s unilateral withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 as well as the “massive onslaught” of sanctions imposed by Washington on Tehran and other signees (Russia China the UK France and Germany) which has been taking place since then. “The most important thing” was Iran’s eagerness to immediately return to full compliance after all of its “justified” concerns over other signees not fulfilling the terms of the deal are removed Moscow pointed out. Maintaining the nuclear agreement should remain a priority for all involved parties the ministry said adding that “a lot in this regard depends on our European partners.” Over the weekend Tehran announced the completion of the fifth and final step in its gradual scaling down of the commitments agreed under the 2015 deal. The country’s nuclear program “no longer faces any operating restrictions” it said adding that the level of uranium enrichment will from now on be solely determined by Iran’s own “technical needs”. Tehran and the IAEA both confirmed that international inspectors are continuing to work with Iran. Think your friends would be interested?

184,None,Photos shown on CBS’ 60 Minutes on Sunday show the inside of Epstein’s cell following his death in August. In them multiple bedsheets have been fashioned into two nooses. A note on the sex offender’s bed gripes about the conditions at New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC). Photos of Epstein’s body show a thin bloody line across the middle of his throat. According to former New York City Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Baden who observed the autopsy the wound is more consistent with murder than suicide. “This noose doesn’t match the ligature furrow mark. It’s wider than this” Baden told 60 Minutes. “Most hangings especially free hangings the ligature slides up to beneath the jawbone the mandible. Here it’s in the middle of the neck.” Epstein’s neck was fractured in multiple places including the hyoid a small bone near the Adam’s apple. “I have never seen three fractures like this in a suicidal hanging” Baden said adding “Going over over a thousand jail hangings suicides in the New York state prisons over the past 40 50 years no one had three fractures.” His injuries also included bruised wrists an abrasion on the arm a muscle injury to the shoulder an injury to the back of the neck and a cut on the lip. However it is unclear if any of these injuries were inflicted by hospital staff trying to resuscitate Epstein. New York’s chief medical examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson ruled Epstein’s death a suicide in August and stands by that decision. However that ruling did little to quiet speculation that the millionaire sex offender was murdered. Epstein’s connections to the rich and powerful – including Bill Clinton Donald Trump and British Prince Andrew – would likely have been brought up during his trial leading some to believe that these people had strong motive to silence Epstein. Epstein had pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing and trafficking multiple girls as young as 14. Back in 2008 a sweetheart deal with Florida prosecutors saw Epstein skate on similar charges serving just 13 months in a minimum-security facility. Speculation was further stoked when it was revealed that security cameras at the MCC allegedly malfunctioned on the night of Epstein’s death. In addition two prison guards who were supposed to check in on the high-profile prisoner every 30 minutes have been charged with conspiracy and falsifying records after it emerged that they slept through their shift on the night. Only one prisoner at MCC Philadelphia mobster Louis Turra has succesfully committed suicide in the last 40 years. Judge Richard Berman who presided over Epstein’s sex trafficking case said in November that it was “unthinkable” that an inmate as high profile as Epstein could die behind bars without guards noticing. Epstein was the only defendant in his case. With his death the case is shut and the alleged victims denied closure. However some of the alleged victims still carry on with civil cases against the deceased pedophile’s estate. Think your friends would be interested?

185,None,"Soleimani who commanded the Iranian military Quds Force was killed in an American airstrike last week an assassination which raised already high tensions between Washington and Tehran to boiling point. Democrats criticized Trump for ordering Soleimani’s killing prompting conservative satire site the Babylon Bee to put its own spin on events. “Democrats call for flags to be flown at half-mast to grieve death of Soleimani” read a headline from the site on Friday. ""As a nation we need to stop and grieve this great austere revered religious scholar. He was one of the good ones” the Bee parodied Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar as saying riffing on the description used by the Washington Post in its obituary for Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in October. “Later Democrats clarified they meant we should fly the Iranian flag at half-mast not the ‘offensive and problematic’ American flag” the article concluded. The article was shared more than 720000 times which didn’t go down well with CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan who claimed that it received the same number of engagements as the top New York Times and CNN stories over the past week. “A lot of people sharing this ‘satirical’ story on Facebook don’t know it’s satire” O’Sullivan tweeted before accusing the Babylon Bee of spreading “clickbait and misinformation” under the guise of satire. “Some family members just called bc their Republican friends on FB are circulating it like it's legit” former CIA analyst Cindy Otis chipped in. “We have a lot of work to do all.” “Someday I’m going to write a whole screed on ‘satirical/humor’ websites. Today however is not that day” Otis continued. Indeed the Babylon Bee’s brand of right-wing humor has annoyed liberal journalists before. Though positioning itself as a political satire outlet in the vein of the Onion the Bee has been ‘fact-checked’ by Snopes dozens of times. These fact checks saw the Bee threatened with demonetization by Facebook prompting the Bee to accuse Snopes of being “actively engaged in an effort to discredit and deplatform us.” In one case Snopes ran a fact check on the Bee’s obviously ludicrous claim that a new California law requires Christians to “register bibles as assault weapons” declaring it “false” for anyone lacking the common sense to figure that out for themselves - or anyone who missed the site’s footer which reads “The Babylon Bee is your trusted source for Christian news satire.” O’Sullivan was roasted on Twitter for his alarmist Twitter thread. “The only difference between Babylon Bee and CNN is that the Babylon Bee knows it’s a parody” wrote journalist Sean Davis. However satire often goes over the heads of its audience. China’s ‘People’s Daily’ was fooled by a 2012 Onion article declaring North Korean leader Kim Jong-un the “Sexiest Man Alive.” The People’s Daily reported the story as news before pulling the piece from its website. Iran’s Fars News Agency also fell for the Onion’s antics reposting an article claiming that 77 percent of rural Americans would “rather vote for Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad” than Barack Obama without realizing it was satire.

186,None,The new research conducted by German and Greek scientists and published in Science centers on signals sent and received by the ends of neurons known as ‘dendrites.’ The information passed by these parts of the brain is key to how the organ decides subsequent actions. Working with slices of human brain tissue the team found unexpectedly complex electrical activity in the dendrites of human pyramidal neurons. Modeling this activity then showed that single neurons were capable of solving computational problems which were thought to need a lot more brain power.  “The dendrites are central to understanding the brain because they are at the core of what determines the computational power of single neurons”said study co-author Matthew Larkum a neuroscientist at Humboldt University of Berlin. “There was a ‘eureka’ moment when we saw the dendritic action potentials for the first time.” Little is currently known about how dendrites operate in other species or if this kind of high-computational activity is uniquely human. However it’s incredibly difficult to record dendrite activity in humans or animals while they’re alive and Larkum says more research is needed to fill in these blanks.

187,None,Trump provoked widespread outrage with a tweet Saturday claiming that Washington had 52 Iranian sites in its crosshairs some of which were “very important” to “Iranian culture.” Those targets he added would be hit “very fast and very hard” if Tehran retaliated for the killing of top general Qassem Soleimani. Asked about the threat on Sunday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that Trump “didn’t say he’d go after cultural sites.” Probed during a separate appearance on ABC News about why Trump was “threatening Iran with war crimes” Pompeo said the administration would “behave lawfully” and “inside the system.” Yet hours after Pompeo’s comments Trump doubled down in comments to White House pool reporters: “They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way” he said. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway was also on damage control Monday saying Trump simply posed the idea as a “question” — though his original tweet explicitly states that cultural sites were among the US’ list of targets. Conway also seemingly attempted to preemptively spin any hits on cultural sites as legitimate by suggesting that Iran has many “strategic military sites” that are “also cultural sites.”  She later clarified that she did not mean to say that Iran was camouflaging its military targets within cultural sites according to Washington Post reporter Aaron Blake. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave a tepid warning against targeting Iran’s cultural heritage saying through a spokesman on Monday that “there are international conventions in place” intended to prevent that kind of destruction. Meanwhile UNESCO also told the US to stay away from Iran’s cultural heritage reminding Washington that it is party to treaties which explicitly prohibit the targeting of cultural sites during armed conflict.  Like this story?

189,None,Jury selection for Weinstein’s trial has begun and all eyes were on the one-time Hollywood titan as he hobbled into court on Monday seemingly trying to look older than his 67 years. Over 100 women have gone on the record accusing him of varying levels of sexual impropriety from unwanted advances to rape. Hundreds more however remained silent while he was allegedly preying on these women even though Weinstein’s behavior was one of the biggest “open secrets” in the industry. When Weinstein was finally indicted on five felony counts of sexual assault and rape in 2018 in New York the number of previously silent boldface names who admitted they had “heard stories” of the megaproducer’s “inappropriate” behavior was almost comical. Most in Hollywood expressed relief that he was finally being held to account but some continued to plead ignorance or even praise the mogul especially actors whose careers he’d launched or aided. Award-winning actors Meryl Streep and Matt Damon both insisted they hadn’t known about his casting couch antics though Damon himself was accused of helping to kill a story exposing Weinstein’s predation. Filmmaker Michael Moore called Weinstein “one of the best people to work with” in Hollywood in 2015; two years later he wasn’t just acting shocked at Weinstein’s sexual improprieties but demanding the industry introduce gender quotas on its boards to forestall future Weinsteins. Widespread awareness that Weinstein was hurting women didn’t stop anyone from working with him during the height of his career so long as that awareness remained confined to the industry. But Weinstein could not have operated without the consent of that industry which still viewed the “casting couch” concept - in which sex is exchanged for roles - as a normal and acceptable part of the business. NBC sitcom 30 Rock was mocking his sexual quid-pro-quos all the way back in 2012 while Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane’s own joke about the predatory producer at a 2013 Oscars event was met with raucous laughter suggesting the audience knew full well what he was talking about. That the allegations against Weinstein never “stuck” until recently was attributed to his legendary ability to “spin - or suppress – anything” with help from the large number of journalists on his payroll. He was also known to threaten anyone who tried to expose him and boasted of his ability to make or break an actor’s career. Some women (including actor Rose McGowan one of his most vocal accusers) were paid off with settlements and employees were silenced with NDAs. It wasn’t until late 2017 that the #MeToo movement kicked off when Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan told their Harvey Weinstein stories - on the record - to the New York Times which published them along with a handful of similar accusations from lesser-known women. Former model Jasmine Lobe who claims to be among Weinstein’s victims told CBS on Monday that if the producer isn’t convicted he’ll be back at work in no time.  In addition to the New York state charges Weinstein was charged on Monday with sexual assault of two women in Los Angeles. The producer however has vowed he will be “fully exonerated” and return to work #MeToo or no #MeToo. And decades of silence from the industry prove that it’s not Weinstein’s predatory behavior that bothers Hollywood - merely the negative publicity from that behavior being exposed. Weinstein is not the only casting couch predator in the industry; he’s just the most recent one to be caught.

190,None,Citing “heightened tensions in the Middle East” the embassy urged Americans in Israel the West Bank and Gaza to “remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness” on Monday noting that rocket fire and other “security incidents” seldom leave much time to react. The memo advised Americans to learn the location of nearby bomb shelters and pay attention to alert sirens. The warning comes in the wake of a US strike that killed Iran’s highest-ranking military commander Qassem Soleimani along with several high-ranking individuals in Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units. Iraq’s Parliament has since voted on a resolution to expel foreign troops from the country while Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has called for attacks on US soldiers and military assets. Tehran has also vowed revenge over Soleimani’s killing which it called an “act of international terrorism.” Esmail Qaani his replacement at the head of Iran’s Quds Force has vowed to “remove America from the region.” Several rockets and mortars hit Baghdad’s Green Zone and surrounding areas over the weekend; five injuries were reported.

191,None,An unspecified number of additional forces will be joining US and Kenyan forces currently stationed at the base the Pentagon announced on Monday. AFRICOM has ruled out the possibility that Sunday’s attack was related to rising tensions between the US and Iran. One US soldier and two contractors died on Sunday when the militant group attacked in a four-hour pre-dawn raid that destroyed two planes two helicopters and several American military vehicles according to a Kenyan police report seen by Reuters. Fewer than 150 US personnel are currently stationed at the base where they are tasked with counterterrorism and training East African forces.

192,None,According to FBI data 28369750 background checks were performed in 2019 smashing the previous record of 27 million in 2016. The agency ran 202465 checks on Black Friday alone. The Christmas period was a festive one for firearms retailers with just under three million checks carried out in December the second-highest month since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System began in 1998. The number of background checks performed does not directly correlate with weapons sales the FBI cautioned. Some states for example carry out checks for concealed-carry permits for example and the figures don’t account for multiple weapons purchased at once. Nevertheless it is the most reliable indicator of nationwide gun sales that exists. Firearms sales typically spike when gun owners feel like their Second Amendment rights are threatened. Though President Trump has been a vocal proponent of gun rights his opponents spent 2019 pushing the opposite message.  Every Democratic candidate for next year’s election has promised to restrict gun rights in some manner with Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke proposing a mass confiscation of AR- and AK-style rifles in September shortly before dropping out of the race. O’Rourke’s fellow Democrats Joe Biden and Kamala Harris then announced that they too would introduce their own mandatory buyback schemes. The following month saw the third-highest number of checks in the whole year. “Americans are choosing to invest their hard-earned dollars in their ability to exercise their rights and buy the firearms they want before gun control politicians attempt to regulate away that ability” a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation told the Associated Press in December. Though violent crime has decreased by more than 50 percent since the early 1990s mass shootings continue to make gun control a headline issue in the US. Last year saw a number of high-profile slayings including two shootings in Texas in August that left 30 people dead a massacre in Virginia Beach that killed 13 and a bloodbath at a nightclub in Dayton Ohio that killed nine.

193,None,“Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290” Hassan Rouhani wrote on Twitter. “Never threaten the Iranian nation.” The US guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes shot down Iran Air Flight 655 with 290 crew and passengers on board over the Strait of Hormuz in July 1988. Washington said the jet didn’t respond to warnings and was identified as an Iranian warplane because of that. Back then Tehran blasted the US for its criminal negligence insisting that the Airbus A300 transmitted the signal which allowed it to be identified as a civilian aircraft. The Americans never admitted guilt or formally apologized to Tehran for the tragedy. However they paid almost $62 million in damages to the relatives of the victims almost a decade later. The number 52 in Trump’s tweet wasn’t pulled out of a hat either. It represents the number of diplomats who were taken hostage by revolutionary students at the US Embassy in Tehran in 1979. The Americans were held for 444 days but were eventually released after negotiations. The US president warned that sites “at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; the Iranian culture” will be hit in order to discourage Iran from retaliating for the assassination of the head of its elite Quds Force Qassem Soleimani. The killing of Soleimani in a US drone strike in Iraq last week has put the two nations on the brink of war. Millions across Iran took to the streets on Sunday to take part in the commander’s funeral shedding tears and shouting anti-American slogans. Think your friends would be interested?

194,None,"LATEST: ‘Not leaving Iraq!’ Pentagon chief clarifies ‘poorly worded’ US withdrawal plan sent by ‘mistake’ “In due deference to the sovereignty” of Iraq the Combined Joint Task Force Iraq will be “repositioning forces over the course of the coming days and weeks to prepare for onward movement” Marine General William H. Seely III wrote in a letter to the Iraqi Defense Ministry on Monday which has surfaced online. “We respect your sovereign decision to order our departure” Seely wrote explaining that the process will involve increased helicopter traffic into and out of Baghdad’s “green zone” mainly during the night-time with the Coalition seeking to “minimize and mitigate” disturbances to civilians. There was initially some confusion about the letter's authenticity with the Pentagon declining to confirm it was real However US Army public affairs officer Rick Dickson stated shortly after the news broke that the letter is ""official and accurate."" The Iraqi parliament adopted a resolution on Sunday seeking to “end the presence of any foreign troops on Iraqi soil” prompted by last week’s US drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and a number of Iraqi Shia militia officials at the Baghdad International Airport.  US President Donald Trump responded by threatening sanctions and saying the US will not leave until the Iraqis “pay us back” for an airbase that he said cost billions of dollars to build. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo likewise dismissed the non-binding resolution saying that he was “confident that the Iraqi people want the United States to continue to be there to fight the counterterror campaign.” The US-led coalition forces were sent to Iraq in 2014 to help the government in Baghdad confront Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) terrorists that had taken a significant portion of Iraqi territory all of which has since been liberated.  Think your friends would be interested?

195,None,In a piece published on CNN's ‘Facts First’ blog Biden was scolded for “dishonestly” claiming he opposed the invasion of Iraq. The fact-check came after Biden told a voter in Iowa at the weekend that he was against the war “from the very moment” George W. Bush launched it. In reality Biden “repeatedly spoke in favor of the war both before and after it began” CNN wrote. The network called Biden's comment “highly misleading even under the most generous interpretation” given that the former VP was “actually a vocal supporter” of military action and voted to authorize Bush's use of force.  Indeed not only did Biden vote for the war a whole nine months later he said that he would “vote that way again.” On the very day the bombing began Biden said Americans should “step back and be supportive” of Bush — a far cry from his recent and disingenuous retelling of history in which he was against the disastrous invasion all along. Only after 2005 Biden started calling his vote a “mistake.” Biden’s continued insistence that he was against the war from the get-go is somewhat strange considering his own campaign acknowledged in September that he “misspoke” the last time he made similar false statements.  His camp has been understandably sensitive about his Iraq record and reluctant to directly respond to fellow 2020 contender Bernie Sanders’ efforts to point it out. So far many in the media have framed Sanders’ targeting of Biden on this subject as a political “attack” — despite it being a simple statement of fact. “Pointing out that Joe was pro Iraq war isn't an attack it's the goddamn truth” one Sanders supporter wrote on Twitter. However Biden tries to spin it to absolve himself of blame seventeen years later it won’t change the facts. He was a leading Democratic voice in favor of military action against Iraq and a crucial ally of the Bush administration in the lead up insisting repeatedly that Saddam Hussein must be removed from power.  Biden even ruled out diplomacy at one point saying that “dialogue with Saddam is useless.” The supposed anti-war Biden even praised Bush for “moderation and deliberation” and called Iraq a “just war” which he believed would lead to “peace and security.” He stood steadfast in his pro-war stance even as many in his own party were raising doubts. The media has often been reluctant to needle Biden on his Iraq War vote parroting his claims that he was “misled” by Bush and touting his foreign policy “experience” as an advantage in the 2020 election — but with even CNN calling Biden out on his record it looks like some in the mainstream media are beginning to grow tired of the lie.

196,None,The candidates got an unwitting makeover during the network’s Squawk Box program on Monday as the show was covering fourth-quarter fundraising totals. Yang’s face was replaced with a similarly-named Asian businessman founding partner of Redpoint Ventures Geoff Yang. Gabbard was replaced even more confusingly by New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand – once a primary candidate herself until she dropped out of the race in August. One could chalk both up to chance mistakes – Geoff and Andrew Yang have the same last name so perhaps their headshots are sequential in the network’s files? Gabbard and Gillibrand were sequential in the alphabetical list of candidates perhaps they forgot to remove the blonde decidedly un-Gabbard-like congresswoman when she called it quits six months ago? But the fact that both candidates each with a decidedly anti-establishment bent have been noticeably shafted by mainstream media in the past led their supporters to cry foul. Hardly anyone believed the “innocent mistake” hypothesis. “This has to be intentional malice” one user observed. “They’re so used to not covering them. Maybe none of their staff knew what they look like” deadpanned one user. Some called the switcheroo racist. “Imagine if it had been [Cory] Booker’s face with another black man. The left would be enraged.” Others took matters into their own hands. Between the #YangMediaBlackout – the outsider candidate has been repeatedly left off graphics poll results and other visual aids even when polling significantly higher than others shown – and the Groundhog Day-like attacks on Gabbard for meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2017 it’s easy to see how both candidates’ supporters might accuse mainstream media of wearing its bias on its sleeve. The network eventually apologized for the mistake and quickly fixed the graphic but not before several people had suggested the Yang campaign take legal action against them. Like this story?

198,None,Ocasio-Cortez considers herself “one of the most hated people in America” she told New York Magazine in an interview published on Monday. Since a surprise electoral victory over a 10-term incumbent Democrat in 2018 she’s since become the face of her party’s emboldened progressive wing alongside ‘The Squad’ of fellow Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib (Michigan) Ilhan Omar (Minnesota) and Massachusetts’ Ayanna Pressley. Ocasio-Cortez’s occasionally loose grip on the truth has made her a favorite punching bag of the Republican Party while her calls for sweeping healthcare climate and immigration reforms have earned rebukes from establishment Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who jested last summer that ‘The Squad’ live in “their Twitter world.” Speaking to New York Magazine Ocasio-Cortez highlighted this growing rift in the Democratic Party. “In any other country Joe Biden and I would not be in the same party but in America we are” she said. A supporter of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for the presidency Ocasio-Cortez cautioned her party of the dangers of running a moderate candidate like Biden. “And that’s exactly what happened to 2016” she said. “We picked the logically fitting candidate but that candidate did not inspire the turnout that we needed.” Among Democrats Ocasio-Cortez said there remains in place a belief that Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 election was based on her personality not her policies. Democrats “often think there was nothing wrong before Trump. They think Hillary was the problem. But it’s much deeper than that.” In attempting to unseat Trump Democrats have been criticized for focusing on their prospective candidates’ “electability” a nebulous term that boils down to which candidate presents the most palatable inoffensive message. Intra-party argument and debate bickering is therefore treated as dangerous when simply defeating Trump is the primary objective. “We’re a family and we have our moments” Pelosi told House Democrats at a meeting in July. “Without that unity we are playing completely into the hands of the other people.” “So the Democratic Party has a role to play in this problem” Ocasio-Cortez told New York Magazine. “It’s not like we’re allowed to talk about it. We’re not allowed to talk about anything wrong the Democratic Party does.” Against this background Ocasio-Cortez encouraged her fellow progressives in Washington to enforce stricter ideological purity rules. The Congressional Progressive Caucus for example does not require members to submit applications allowing anyone on Capitol Hill to identify as a progressive. “They let anybody who the cat dragged in call themselves a progressive. There’s no standard” she declared adding “Democrats can be too big of a tent.” If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/477602-aoc-interview-joe-biden-/,0.8102863824704665
199,None,“There’s been no decision to leave Iraq. Period” Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday. He was referring to reports that the head of Combined Joint Task Force Iraq General William H. Seely III informed the Iraqi government of preparations to reposition the coalition forces “in due deference to the sovereignty” of Iraq. Meanwhile Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said that the letter Seely had sent was only a draft and that releasing it was a “mistake.” The Iraqi military confirmed receiving it however. Esper would neither confirm nor deny the letter’s authenticity though US Army public relations officials said earlier it was real. Instead he reiterated the position staked out earlier by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the Iraqi people “want the US to stay” and cited the rise in attacks by Iranian “proxy groups.” US President Donald Trump likewise rejected the withdrawal on Sunday threatening Iraq with sanctions and saying the US will not leave until the Iraqis “pay us back” for an airbase that he said cost billions of dollars to build. On Sunday the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution asking the government to disinvite all foreign troops – including the US-led coalition against Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) – after last week’s assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in a US drone strike outside Baghdad International Airport.  The resolution is non-binding but reflects the growing frustration in Baghdad with continued US operations in Iraq long after the official defeat of IS was proclaimed.

200,None,"“The assassination of Soleimani isn't an Israeli event but an American event. We were not involved and should not be dragged into it” Netanyahu reportedly told his security cabinet during a meeting on Monday as cited by Israel's Channel 13. He advised ministers to avoid speaking to the media about Thursday's targeted assassination beyond supporting the US' right to defend itself so as not to give the impression that Israel had played any role in it. The directors of Mossad and military intelligence reassured the ministers that the likelihood of a retaliatory attack is low since ""Israel stayed at a distance from the incident"" and that Iran will begin planning its reciprocal move on Tuesday following the conclusion of the national mourning period for Soleimani according to the same sources. Netanyahu’s sudden reticence is particularly notable because he has been advocating a US-Iran conflict for much of his political career. For over 20 years he has insisted that the Islamic Republic was just steps away from producing nuclear weapons even when Israeli intelligence publicly argued otherwise. The Israeli PM was also front and center in the run-up to the most recent Iraq War warning the US Congress in 2002 that Saddam Hussein had ""weapons of mass destruction"" – including pursuing atomic bombs – which turned out not to exist at all. Just last year Netanyahu was urging the US and its Middle Eastern allies to take up the cause of war against Iran emboldened by US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal and re-impose crippling sanctions against Tehran despite its compliance with the agreement. However the overt US killing of a military commander who was apparently very popular in Iran has provoked serious talk of retribution not just in Tehran but among Hezbollah – the Lebanese Shia militia that boasts of fighting Israel to a draw in 2006 – as well. Netanyahu has had a tough 2019 clinging onto the post of PM in a purely technical mandate after two elections mere months apart delivered a hung Knesset and required an unprecedented third coming this spring. Talking a tough game against Iran in order to get Israeli votes is one thing but facing the real possibility of being the target of Iranian missiles is apparently quite another. Like this story?

201,None,At least 30 trainees were killed and another 33 injured in the Saturday strike health officials of the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) said noting the total death toll could still increase. In one video circulating online somewhat grainy and taken from a distance a column of trainees is briefly seen in marching formation before it is obliterated by a direct hit that comes out of nowhere. A number of trainees are thrown to the ground immediately – many of them presumably killed – while a handful of survivors attempt to flee. A second much more graphic clip has also emerged apparently taken in the moments following the strike. Screams of shock and prayers can be heard as someone looks over the grisly scene with body parts and puddles of blood scattered across the academy courtyard. Footage captured later on shows debris still littering the charred concrete. While it remains unclear who carried out the deadly bombing this weekend the UN’s envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame suggested on Monday it was “probably” forces supporting the rival legislature based in Tobruk led by military commander Khalifa Haftar. A spokesperson from Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) denied any involvement in the attack. Salame stopped short of assigning definitive blame however and spoke out against foreign interference in Libya. “Keep your hands out of Libya the country is suffering too much from foreign interference in different ways” Salame said. “There is enough weapons in Libya they don’t need extra weapons there are enough mercenaries in Libya so stop sending mercenaries as is the case right now with hundreds probably thousands coming into the country.” On Thursday the Turkish parliament approved the deployment of troops and weapons in Libya in order to prop up the GNA against the LNA. Haftar responded by declaring jihad and vowing to “confront and expel” any foreign forces in Libya. Though the GNA is the internationally recognized government Haftar’s forces control most of the country. They have made efforts to take Tripoli since April last year and announced a major push in early December. Libya never recovered from the US-led NATO operation which overthrew leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 unleashing years of bloody conflict and instability. Like this story?

202,None,The visa request was filed several weeks ago before the latest escalation and would give the top Iranian diplomat a stage to speak out following last Thursday’s drone strike assassination of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Qassem Soleimani along with senior Iraqi militia leaders. “They fear that someone comes to the US and reveals realities” Zarif said after being denied a visa. He vowed to communicate with the American people from Tehran noting that “the world is not limited to New York.” The US State Department has declined to comment on the Iranian diplomat’s visa troubles. The murder of Soleimani who played a key role in the fight against Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) terrorists in Syria and Iraq has drawn outrage across Iran and Iraq with Tehran vowing to avenge the assassination which it called “an act of international terrorism.” Washington meanwhile insists that Soleimani was the mastermind behind a spate of attacks on American personnel including at the US Embassy and says he was plotting new assaults. This wouldn’t be the first time Washington abused its status as the host of the UN headquarters refusing to issue visas for nearly a dozen members of the Russian delegation to a summit in New York last year.

203,None,The breathtaking visuals were created with help from SOFIA a high-powered airborne telescope fixed to a modified Boeing 747 which cast its infrared gaze 600 light years into the Milky Way. Combining SOFIA’s data with that of other telescopes produced a dazzling composite image of our galaxy’s center. “It’s incredible to see our galactic center in detail we’ve never seen before” said James Radomski a scientist working on the SOFIA project at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California. The Quintuplet Cluster where stars burn a million times brighter than Earth’s Sun also clearly emerged in the composite. The snapshot may help researchers understand what’s holding up the star-formation in the remote region. Though rich with gas dust and other space debris scientists have detected a puzzling lack of massive stars near the galactic center around 10 times fewer than expected. “Understanding how massive star birth happens at the center of our own galaxy gives us information that can help us learn about other more distant galaxies” said Matthew Hankins the principal investigator of the project and a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology. Scientists also have better insight into the supermassive blackhole smack in the center of the Milky Way thanks to the new image which provides a view of a mysterious 10-light-year-wide ring surrounding the gargantuan void which continues to baffle researchers. Collected in July 2019 the new SOFIA data was presented for the first time at an event in Hawaii earlier this week and has been submitted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal.

204,None,The bombers will be “available for operations against Iran if ordered” CNN’s Barbara Starr reported Monday citing an unnamed US official though the reporter noted the new deployment “does not signal that operations have been ordered.” The deployment also appears to have been corroborated by military aviation watchers who tracked at least two bombers as they departed from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The six bombers will follow nearly 4000 US troops deployed to the region since last week sent as hostilities with Iran reached new heights. Following a heated demonstration at the American Embassy in Baghdad which Washington portrayed as an “Iranian attack” the US launched a kill strike on the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force Qassem Soleimani as he arrived to Baghdad for a meeting also taking out several allied Iraqi militia leaders along with him. While the US maintains the general was involved in plots to attack American forces Tehran insists the assassination – of a top official on a diplomatic trip no less – was an act of “international terrorism” and has vowed to retaliate. Monday’s B-52 deployment is not the only one in recent months with four more of the long-range heavy bombers sent to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar last May also for the purpose of countering the so-called “Iranian threat.” Like this story?

206,None,Chinmayi Sripada became one of the leading figures in India’s #MeToo movement when she accused popular lyricist and novelist Vairamuthu of sexual assault (a claim that he rejects). She has one million followers on Twitter – and that’s where she sparked a heated debate over her recent post. “A woman’s character a Dalit’s merit and a Muslim’s patriotism are always questioned in this country” her message read. Though the words were not Sripada’s own – the quote had previously gone viral on social media – her followers were quick to react. Many users accused the singer of trying to over-simplify complicated issues. She was also accused of “fake feminism” and trying to connect “unrelated things” for attention. There are plenty of Indians who are “not even caste conscious” argued another Twitter user arguing that her post “conflates issues” and damages Sripada’s credibility. Tensions over religious issues are ongoing in India over Muslim protests – sometimes violent in nature – against a new citizenship law which they claim is discriminatory. New Delhi continues to stress that the legislation is not prejudiced against any group. Like this story?

209,None,"Iranian MPs adopted a bill on Tuesday calling “personnel of the Pentagon all affiliated companies institutions agents and commanders” members of a “terrorist entity”local media reported. The bill amends and expands previous legislation which gave a similar designation to US Central Command (CENTCOM). Initiated in April of last year it was a tit-for-tat response to Washington’s blacklisting of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The latest designation however comes as tensions between Washington and Tehran reach boiling point following the US’ assassination of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Friday. Tehran has vowed to avenge Soleimani’s death a promise that in turn led to US President Donald Trump threatening to strike 52 “very high level"" Iranian cultural and state targets should Iran hit any American interests. The Iranian government has reportedly been considering 13 “revenge scenarios” in retaliation for Soleimani’s killing. The semi-official Fars News Agency quoted Iranian Supreme National Security Council secretary Ali Shamkhani as saying that “even if there is consensus on the weakest scenario carrying it out can be a historic nightmare for the Americans.” Think your friends would be interested?

The German government says they could be moved back if their training mission resumes. The move comes a day after German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi about the issue.

211,None,While there have been other contenders discovered in the TRAPPIST-1 system and several potentially-habitable worlds identified by NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope the recently discovered exoplanet TOI 700 d was the first discovered by TESS with the help of NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope. TOI 700 is a small cool M class dwarf star roughly 100 light-years away in the constellation Dorado. It boasts 40 percent the mass and size of our sun with roughly half the Sun’s surface temperature.  Around the star TESS has observed at least three planets only one of which is in the so-called ‘Goldilocks Zone’ which might produce conditions for human habitation and for life most notably those that allow for liquid water on the surface.  Planet TOI 700 b is almost exactly Earth-sized probably rocky and completes an orbit every ten days while TOI 700 c is 2.6 times larger than Earth orbits every 16 days and is likely to be a gassy planet though both are too close to the sun to sustain life. TOI 700 d however is the outermost of the three and the only planet in the habitable zone of the system. It is 20 percent larger than the Earth has an orbit of 37 days and absorbs 86 percent of the energy that the Earth receives from the Sun.  NASA believes that the planets are all tidally locked which means they rotate once per orbit meaning one side of the surface is in constant sunlight. This would mean that if it has an atmosphere its cloud formations and wind patterns would be vastly different from those found here on Earth. “Additionally in 11 months of data we saw no flares from the star which improves the chances TOI 700 d is habitable and makes it easier to model its atmospheric and surface conditions” Emily Gilbert a graduate student at the University of Chicago.  Researchers at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland modelled 20 possible environments for TOI 700 d including one ocean-covered simulation with a CO2-rich atmosphere similar to what scientists believe Mars was like many years ago.  Another model led to a cloudless all-land version of modern Earth with winds flowing away from the night side of the planet all converging on a point directly facing the star.  Future missions will hopefully determine whether the planets have atmospheres or not and what their composition is.

212,None,The unit previously stationed in the southeastern region of North Gyeongsang Province was moved to a former military installation located behind the presidential office compound Yonhap news agency reported citing sources familiar with the matter. The redeployment was reportedly carried out earlier this month. It is also mentioned in the report that the unit is believed to be equipped with missiles capable of intercepting an aircraft or missiles at altitudes of around 20-40km (12.5-25 miles). The decision to relocate the system follows a series of warnings issued by Pyongyang including a threat alluding to the unveiling of a new strategic weapon “in the near future.” President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday that South Korea must strengthen its relationship with Pyongyang and has called for the resumption of dialogue between the two states. At the beginning of the year North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un announced that Pyongyang is dropping its earlier nuclear promises unless the US changed its policy. Previously North Korea had given Washington until the end of 2019 to rethink it’s hardline position which called for North Korea to drop its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

214,None,The Defence Food Research Laboratory produced a menu of about 30 dishes which range from moong dal halwa an Indian dessert made with split mung beans to idli a type of savoury rice cake along with a selection of vegetable rolls and egg rolls. While the dishes are all classified as Ready To Eat (RTE) the crew will enjoy the relative luxury of having a food heater on board so they can enjoy hot meals while taking in the views of planet Earth.  “Apart from the food we are also tasked with providing food-warmer technology stainless steel cutlery and a waste disposal pack” Defence Food Research Laboratory director Anil Semwal said.  Despite being impressed with the fare on offer many took the opportunity to joke about the absence of the traditional Muslim biryani dish from the menu. Some were even forward-thinking enough to suggest bringing a few spare Indian delicacies just in case the crew encounters extraterrestrials during their five to seven-day mission in low Earth orbit.

If successful India will become one of just four nations to launch a manned mission to space alongside Russia the US and China.  Last week ISRO chief K Sivan announced that the four candidates for the mission have been selected and will begin their training in Russia later this month. The manned mission will be preceded by two unmanned missions to orbit the first in December followed by a second in 2021. The ISRO previously stated it wants a female astronaut on the mission but the identities of the crew have yet to be revealed publicly.  The mission is estimated to cost roughly US$1.3 billion (10000 Crore) and has been set a launch target of no later than December 2021 by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

217,None,The study by United for All Ages a charity which focuses on bringing old and young people together says that UK citizens rarely interact with other generations outside of their own families. One of the charity’s directors Stephen Burke claimed bringing different generations together was one of “the biggest challenges for the new decade.” He added that “the last decade saw huge disconnection and division.” According to the report divisions have increased as a result of the housing market with the concentration of wealth now firmly in the hands of older people. They tend to live in towns and rural areas while the young are sucked in by city life. The authors of the report published on Tuesday are calling for care homes to become community hubs and for schools to stay open longer to provide community spaces for intergenerational activities. Other ideas put forward include creating an additional bank holiday as a “national day of unity” to bring people together and a new government department for connection that gives support to intergenerational projects.

218,None,Under the new rules announced Monday by Monika Bickert Facebook’s head of global policy management videos will be removed from Instagram and Facebook if they meet two criteria.  Videos will be automatically flagged by Facebook if they have “been edited or synthesised … in ways that aren’t apparent to an average person and would likely mislead someone into thinking that a subject of the video said words that they did not actually say” or if they are “the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning that merges replaces or superimposes content onto a video making it appear to be authentic.” If a video is deemed to be false or partly false Facebook will “significantly reduce” its distribution in users’ news feeds and reject it outright if it is posing as an ad.  The company is opting to leave such offending videos on the platform but marking them false to help prevent them spreading under false pretences on other social media platforms and elsewhere on the internet.  In a bid to cover all its bases Facebook said that even videos that do not meet these two criteria would still be eligible for “independent review” by the company's third-party fact-checkers which include 50 partners covering 40 languages. Facebook gave no immediate clear examples of what type of content would be in breach of such rules though it did state that the policy does not cover ‘shallow fakes’ or videos made using traditional video editing tools while claiming that parody and satire videos would be exempted.  “This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or video that has been edited solely to omit or change the order of words” Bickert stated. One example of the difference in content which contravenes the guidelines and that which does not would be videos shared last year of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slurring her speech. This footage would apparently not contravene Facebook's new ‘deepfake’ guidelines as it was merely slowed down and the audio pitch-shifted using traditional video editing techniques.  In 2018 Donald Trump shared a video of a Fox News segment which was edited in such a way as to make it appear as though Pelosi was fumbling her words. This would fall under “traditional video editing techniques” and would therefore be allowed on the platform. But another video that went viral online purported to show Pelosi slurring far more heavily and was often posted with titles insinuating that she was drunk. This type of video falls somewhere in the middle as it has been both slowed down and pitch-shifted though not necessarily by an AI or machine learning algorithm and would therefore likely be referred to the third party fact checkers for review. However the company added that if a politician posts something which breaches the deepfake guidelines they may still allow it to remain even if it was expressly intended to mislead if Facebook deems the public interest in seeing it outweighs the potential harm.

As some song was turned on the eccentric billionaire started to boogie away on the stage busting out somewhat awkward dance moves. He gave out high fives even throwing his jacket off as the beats got more energetic. No stranger to bizarre on-stage stunts Musk tweeted footage of his performance later on. The original soundtrack however was changed to a Chinese song which made the strange set-up a bit more melodic.   Unsurprisingly many of Musk’s followers rushed to respond with many joking about his moves. “Peak Dad dancing” one Twitter user wrote while another added: “Should’ve taken it all off.” Others checked his dance against the previous ones suggesting that his skills haven’t improved. There were also some who drew parallels with the already forgotten dance performed by Bill Gates at the launch of Windows 95 almost 25 years ago. All in all Musk’s performance stole the limelight from the actual event which spells delivery of the very first batch of middle-market made-in-China cars made at Tesla’s Shanghai megafactory worth around $2 billion.

It struck at a depth of just 6km according to the USGS and was followed by several powerful aftershocks. El Nuevo Dia newspaper is reporting that a 73-year-old man died after a wall fell on him during one of the quakes. The US territory has been rocked by dozens of temblors in recent days including a 5.8 magnitude quake that damage toppled houses and sparked small landslides on Monday.   Authorities have activated security measures on the island and said all public sector offices except for emergency services would remain closed while emergency plans are implemented. The full impact of the tremors has yet to be revealed but several buildings in the town of Guanica have collapsed and there have been widespread power outages across the island. Footage on social media even shows power outages in Puerto Rico’s capital San Juan including at the country’s main airport which is over 100km from the epicenter of the quake. Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) Chief Executive Jose Ortiz said its Central Costa Sur power plant sustained damage during the quake and it is checking other substations on the island. The utility said on Twitter that it cut off power on safety grounds and hoped to reconnect supplies as soon as possible. Like this story?

222,None,With Brexit day (January 31) fast approaching what could be more fitting than the sound of Britain’s most iconic bell tower reverberating on the strike of 11 o’clock in celebration – or so the Tory Brexiteers were hoping. It appears the Conservative campaign – which had the support of former Brexit Secretary David Davis – to see this become a reality has been stopped in its tracks by House Speaker Lindsay Hoyle who has not selected their amendment for debate. The amendment to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) tabled on Tuesday requested that the famous bell be reattached at 11pm on Brexit day. The 315ft Grade I listed Elizabeth Tower along with the rest of Parliament’s estate is undergoing refurbishment work. While it’s a blow for Tory campaigners it ostensibly won’t put a stop to Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage’s celebration plans. The man widely regarded as the single-most influential figure in the campaign to see the UK leave the European Union claims he’s planning a £100000 bash of his own in Trafalgar Square complete with fireworks speakers and bands. British lawmakers embark on three days of debating the Brexit WAB after coming back from Christmas recess on Tuesday following PM Boris Johnson’s landslide victory in the 2019 snap general election. Johnson’s huge parliamentary majority means that his Brexit deal with Brussels is likely to easily get the approval of a majority of MPs. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

223,None,Putin arrived in Damascus on Tuesday in the first visit to the Syrian capital since the outbreak of the war in 2011. His motorcade drove to the Russian expeditionary force’s command center where he met with Syrian President Bashar Assad. The Russian president told his Syrian colleague during the meeting that “the signs of peaceful life are visible to the naked eye on the streets of Damascus” according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. He also pointed out that it can now safely be said that “great progress has been made on the road to restoring Syria’s statehood and territorial integrity.” The two leaders were briefed on the military situation in Syria including the northwestern province of Idlib occupied by militants linked to Al-Qaeda. Assad thanked Putin and Russia for their support in restoring peace in Syria. Russian troops have been assisting the Syrian army since September 2015 in battling various terrorist groups including Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS). On his previous visit to Syria in 2017 Putin had only visited the Russian expeditionary force at Khmeimim Airbase in the Latakia Province. His meeting with Assad comes amid renewed tensions between the US and Iran – another ally of Damascus – over the US assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad last week. After the military briefing the Russian leader walked through Damascus and visited two major shrines of Muslims and Christians underlining their peaceful coexistence. At the famous Umayyad Mosque Putin presented the local community with a gift of a rare 17th-century copy of the Koran.  Visiting the Holy Virgin Mary Orthodox church the oldest Christian shrine in Syria Putin met with Antiochian Patriarch John X. As a Christmas gift he presented the patriarch with an icon of the Mother of God painted in Russia.  “Were it not for the Russian military aid terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi or some other militant chief would have stood in the place of this temple today” Peskov relayed the patriarch’s words to reporters.  Following his visit to Damascus Putin departed for Turkey where he is scheduled to attend the opening ceremonies of the ‘Turk Stream’ gas pipeline with his Turkish colleague Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He is also scheduled to discuss with Erdogan the security situation in both Syria and Libya where Turkey has just sent troops. Think your friends would be interested?

224,None,Newly published research has revealed that on 25 April 2019 two neutron stars around 520 million light-years away merged into a new object named GW190425 not exactly catchy. This event marks just the second such collision astronomers have seen; the first was detected back in August 2017 and called GW170817. Again astrophysicists and astronomers aren’t famed for their ability at coming up with catchy names. What has scientists really excited about this recent discovery is that it may soon shed light on a “previously undetected type of astrophysical system.” The difference between these two truly massive moments in scientific history is that during the more recent collision between the two stars of GW190425 there was no light detected.  This is likely because it happened so far away and one of the only instruments we have to detect such events was offline when it happened. However as always science finds a way and researchers were able to analyze the data and make some conclusions and some inferences determining that one of the neutron stars in the binary was 1.4 times the mass of the Sun and the other was around 2 times the mass of the Sun. “We were very surprised by the total mass of this ancient neutron star binary system which is about 3.4 times the mass of our Sun as it far exceeds the mass of known neutron star binaries in our own galaxy” said theoretical physicist Susan Scott of the Australian National University. This may mean that the previous binary system discovered (GW170817) formed differently than those found in the Milky Way which may also suggest that similar neutron binaries may not be detectable using current telescopic surveys of the sky. The collision may also provide new insights into the so-called “mass gap” which sits between neutron stars and black holes both of which are the ultra dense remains of dead stars. We’ve never observed a black hole smaller than five stellar masses and we’ve also never seen a neutron star larger than 2.5 stellar masses.  Continued study of both the epic objects and the as yet unknown bodies they produced could answer some of the most perplexing questions about this “mass gap.” Think your friends would be interested?

225,None,The British Academy of Film and Television Arts unveiled its 2020 nominations on Tuesday creating a storm of controversy in the process. All of the 18 stars tipped for best actor actress supporting actor and supporting actress are caucasian. Two actresses Margot Robbie and Scarlett Johansson were nominated twice.  Film fans took to Twitter to vent. “Things need to change” screenwriter Sarah Dollard wrote. “Membership demographics voting procedure the levelling of the playing field re screenings &amp; screeners. This can’t happen again.” Tuesday’s controversy is not the first time a hashtag campaign has been deployed to complain about the supposed lack of diversity in the entertainment industry. The 2015 2016 and 2017 BAFTAs were also panned for excluding minority actors and actresses. Across the Atlantic the #OscarsSoWhite campaign kicked off in 2016 too with even President Barack Obama weighing in asking Hollywood if people of all races were “getting a fair shot.” As for whether the movies themselves were any good that much was lost in the discussion. Commenters on Twitter insisted that actors Lupita Nyong’o Jennifer Lopez Awkwafina and Cynthia Erivo put in performances worthy of an award. Some cynical commenters disagreed however and argued“if you ain’t good enough you don’t deserve a nomination.” BAFTA’s awards director Emma Baehr addressed the controversy on Tuesday telling the Hollywood Reporter that her organization would be happy to nominate non-white actors and actresses if enough films featuring them were submitted for review. “We’d have liked to have seen more diversity in the nominations it does continue to be an industry-wide issue” she said. “I think more films need to be made and entered giving people a chance to see them. We’d absolutely like to see more diversity but I also don’t want to take away from those celebrating today.” In addition to the race controversy fans were outraged at BAFTA’s decision to nominate only men in its ‘Best Director’ category with many complaining that ‘Little Women’ director Greta Gerwig deserved a nomination. Gerwig was also snubbed at the recent Golden Globes which also featured an all-male shortlist of directors.  If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/news/477652-baftas-white-awards-controversy/,0.8103434993522982

227,None,Ocasio-Cortez (AOC for short) stepped a little too far outside the mainstream when she clicked ‘like’ on a tweet by journalist Rania Khalek about US fears of Iranian retaliation over the killing of General Qassem Soleimani. An army of blue-checks and their enforcers quickly encircled her to point out the error of her ways gloating when she finally knuckled under and apologized. AOC was one of the few Democratic politicians credibly horrified by President Donald Trump’s unprovoked attack and to her credit she immediately took to Twitter to denounce it calling out an “act of war against Iran” that “risks the lives of millions of innocent people.” Khalek’s tweet was largely in the same vein making the point that “this assassination did the opposite of making Americans safer and our leaders know it.” But it wasn’t the content of the tweet that infuriated these social media hall monitors who have been gently prodding AOC toward an anodyne centrism since she arrived in Washington; it was the account doing the tweeting. Khalek is an outspoken opponent of US foreign policy particularly the draconian sanctions and endless regime-change wars that have all but destroyed large swathes of the Middle East over the past two decades. She has made a lot of enemies in standing up for the US’s bogeymen and they came out in force to concern-troll AOC. “I’m a big fan but did you know you’ve committed a thoughtcrime?” seemed to be the general message.  Some like ‘professional troll’ Maryam Nayeb Yazdi who has made no secret of her loathing for Iran’s current government deleted their tweets after AOC was badgered into un-liking Khalek’s message and - supposedly - apologizing via Direct Message for her ‘crime’.    But merely apologizing and unliking the tweet wasn’t enough for some - one regime change fan actually called for a memo to be circulated in Congress to warn “progressive members” about Khalek and fellow anti-war journalists Max Blumenthal and Ben Norton. Clearly a preemptive strike against wrongthink was needed.  It’s hardly the first time AOC has made a bold statement and then ran in the other direction - she was shamed away from speaking out against the Israeli occupation of Palestine before she was even officially elected to Congress and more recently she was the subject of a Twitter pile-on when she attempted to speak up for UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Nor is it the first time a ’progressive’ US politician has had their knuckles rapped for veering too far outside the accepted mainstream. Even Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard one of the loudest voices in Washington speaking out against the US’s regime change wars has been forced to adopt the establishment line about Syrian President Bashar Assad with whom she met in 2017 in the service of finding a peaceful solution to the decade-long war the US has waged in his country. Following an avalanche of media criticism that is still ongoing nearly three years later Gabbard has called Assad an evil dictator. Unfortunately there are no progressive role models in Congress for AOC (or Gabbard for that matter) to look up to as an example of how to stick to one’s principles and stand against war. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders while a steadfast supporter of the rights of the working class has largely toed the line on foreign policy throughout his career lining up with the rest of Congress to demand Assad Venezuela's Maduro - or whoever the bogeyman of the moment is - must go. Even the standard-bearers of the rabidly anti-Trump Democratic Party limited their criticism of the Soleimani strike to the president’s failure to gain approval from Congress first. AOC may have to choose between being on the right side of history and being embraced by her party - and its Twitter enforcers.

228,None,The move was made public in a letter to the families of Canadian soldiers in and near Iraq posted to Twitter on Tuesday. Canada has about 500 troops in Iraq out of 800 in total in the region and it's not clear how many are leaving or for how long. The decision to temporarily relocate was made in conjunction with NATO and other Canadian allies Vance continued adding that Canada has “temporarily paused” its military activities falling under Operation IMPACT and NATO Mission Iraq. The Iraqi parliament passed a resolution earlier this week urging an end to the presence of foreign troops after a US airstrike killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad Airport. While US President Donald Trump has threatened Iraq with massive sanctions if it forces the US to withdraw without paying for an expensive airbase the Americans built a letter published Monday appeared to show the US planning to withdraw from the country. The Pentagon has fervently denied this is the case. Germany announced on Tuesday that it will move some of its troops stationed in Iraq to Jordan and Kuwait. Like this story?

229,None,Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi acknowledged receiving a letter from the US military containing an outline for the withdrawal of American troops from his country. However the Iraqi leader said that the English and Arabic versions of the letter were not identical and that he has requested clarification Reuters reported on Tuesday. One day earlier a copy of a letter announcing the US withdrawal was circulated online and confirmed as genuine by a US Army press spokesman. However the Pentagon did not immediately confirm its authenticity and Defense Secretary Mark Esper later stated that that the letter was a “poorly worded” draft copy leaked by mistake. Esper added that “there’s been no decision to leave Iraq. Period.” The letter emerged after the Iraqi parliament voted on Sunday to expel all foreign troops from the country following the US assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad International Airport on Friday and several clashes between American forces and Iranian-backed militia groups in the weeks beforehand. The parliament resolution is non-binding and US President Donald Trump responded by threatening sanctions on Iraq and refusing to leave until the Iraqis “pay us back” for an airbase that he said cost billions of dollars to build. The assassination of Soleimani drove already simmering US-Iran tensions to boiling point. Tehran has vowed to avenge its fallen general while Trump has threatened to launch military strikes on 52 Iranian state and cultural sites should American interests be harmed. As Soleimani’s body was buried in Iran on Tuesday the semi-state Fars news agency reported that the Iranian government is considering 13 “revenge scenarios” in retaliation for the killing.

230,None,"Soleimani commander of the Iranian military’s Quds Force was assassinated in a drone strike in Baghdad Iraq on Friday. Before the strike President Donald Trump implicated Iran in a fatal rocket attack on an American base in Iraq in December and in the storming of the American embassy in Baghdad by protesters last week. Afterwards he said that Soleimani was killed to prevent “imminent and sinister” attacks against American officials and troops in the Middle East. With Washington and Tehran throwing escalatory threats at each other following the strike Pompeo spoke to reporters on Tuesday. Asked for evidence of the threat posed by Soleimani the US secretary of state provided little in the way of information. Instead he claimed that America’s intelligence agencies gave Trump “multiple pieces of information” proving Soleimani’s nefarious intentions but declined to say what this information detailed.  Citing Soleimani’s activities in Iraq and Syria but neglecting to mention that the Quds Force commander was instrumental in the defeat of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) in these countries Pompeo again gave no specific evidence of any planned attacks. Instead he pointed to the rocket attack on an American base and to the embassy riots as proof of his future plans. “If you’re looking for imminence you needn’t look no further than the days that lead up to the strike” he told reporters. “It was the right decision. We got it right.” Few observers were left satisfied. “He has absolutely nothing” one commenter wrote on Twitter. “These men want to lie us into war again.” At a Pentagon press conference later on Tuesday Defense Secretary Mark Esper reiterated the administration's claim of imminent attacks stating that Soleimani was planning on hitting US targets within ""days for sure."" Esper also quashed rumors that the US is preparing to leave Iraq even after the Iraqi parliament voted to expel foreign troops. Esper said that the vote was non-binding and argued that ordinary Iraqis want American troops to stay in the country. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi claimed on Sunday that Soleimani was in Iraq to discuss a possible peace agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia. When asked about this on Tuesday Pompeo laughed and delivered a sarcastic response. “Anybody here believe that?” he asked. “Is there any history that would indicate that it is remotely possible that this kind gentleman this diplomat of great order Qassem Soleimani had traveled to Baghdad for the idea of conducting a peace mission? We know that wasn’t true.” The assassination of Soleimani triggered the sharpest escalation of tensions between Iran and the US since the Trump administration withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA or Iran nuclear deal) in 2018 and launched a “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions and isolation on the Islamic Republic. In recent days Trump has threatened to target 52 “high level” Iranian cultural and state sites while Iran has declared the US military a “terrorist entity” and reportedly considered 13 “revenge scenarios” in retaliation for Soleimani’s killing.

231,None,With the UK still reeling from more than three years of debates about Brexit even simple packaging can set off hair triggers with some fearing any expression of national pride. In this feverish environment a picture of a Co-Op ice cube bag emblazoned with a British flag and the words “made with British water” has sparked a meltdown on Twitter. “What is British water exactly? Does it fall on the left live in a thatched cottage and think itself superior to other races of H2O?” one exasperated commenter asked. “Water flows here there and everywhere. Water like fish knows no borders. The Co-op has been and should be better than this. Stop it” another added. “What next? British air?” came another wry response. The supermarket sought to explain the situation by outlining that its labelling policy dictates that it provides the country of origin of the main ingredients in any product even ice cubes. “Sorry if our ice cubes have caused a bit of chill on Twitter” a spokesperson for the brand said. “But our labelling policy means that we always aim to provide the country origin of the main ingredients in any product and that includes the water in our ice cubes.

232,None,The deputy commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was among the Iranian and Iraqi officials killed in a US operation in Baghdad on Friday. And PMF which unites some 40 militias and has around 150000 members promised that they won’t let American “criminals” get away with murder. “All retaliation options are on the table… no red lines shall hinder our revenge” Jawad Al Telbawi a commander of one of the factions within the group told the Independent. “We shall convulse the ground underneath the American army’s feet in Iraq. Theseare not slogans rather truths in which we believe.” The threat was directed at “fool and a blackmailer” Trump his administration and the US military stationed in Iraq but Telbawi also had plenty to say to ordinary Americans. He called upon US citizens to “pressure” the Trump administration to pull out American troops from the Iraqi territory “before we send your soldiers back in coffins.” Anti-American sentiment was already strong in Iraq as local protesters tried storming the US embassy in Baghdad before the New Year. But it skyrocketed after the US strike against Soleimani which Washington carried out without even notifying the Iraqi authorities. In the wake of the attack the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution calling for the removal of US and other foreign troops from the country.  On Monday Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi spoke with US ambassador to Baghdad Matthew Tueller about “the importance of mutual cooperation on implementing the withdrawal of foreign troops” and preventing “the descent into open war.” But both the US president and the secretary of defense said they are not ready to leave yet insisting Iraqis want them to stay.

234,None,“It’s something ultimately that I want to see we can’t be there forever” Trump said Tuesday asked if he would pull out troops from Iraq. “Eventually we want to be able to let Iraq run its own affairs… but this isn’t the right point” he quickly added. The president’s words echoed the rhetoric coming from the Pentagon where Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters earlier in the day that there were no plans to pull out of Iraq regardless of the unsigned draft letter sent to the government in Baghdad on Monday suggesting otherwise. Trump did contradict Esper’s stated justification for staying in Iraq – the need to maintain a presence against the resurgence of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists – by saying that the US “got rid of the Caliphate a hundred percent of the Caliphate is gone.” He seemed convinced however that a majority of Iraqis want the US troops to stay saying that there was “tremendous support” from the people who do not wish to see Iran take over. “Iraqi people understand we’re there to help them stand up their sovereignty” chimed in Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who was at the Oval Office with Trump and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Both Pompeo and Esper have been working that talking point tirelessly for the past two days with the Pentagon chief telling reporters that Sunday’s resolution adopted by the Iraqi parliament that asked the US to leave was not the work of just some Shia lawmakers while Sunni and Kurdish MPs boycotted the vote.  The resolution followed last week’s US drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani outside Baghdad international airport. On Tuesday Trump once again called Soleimani a “monster” and a dangerous terrorist argued that the assassination saved lives of both Americans and Iraqis and noted that Soleimani had been “traveling with the head of Hezbollah” – possibly conflating the Lebanese-based militia with one of the factions of Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). PMF deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was killed in the same strike that targeted Soleimani. His death angered many Iraqis and PMF even threatened to send US troops back in coffins if they do not leave the country. Think your friends would be interested?

235,None,Putin’s plane touched down in Syria on Tuesday to everyone’s surprise as the president was last spotted in St. Petersburg the evening before attending the Orthodox Christmas Eve service. His unannounced trip included not only talks about fighting terrorism with Syrian President Bashar Assad but also visits to the city’s historic religious sites. After the talks Putin and Assad took a walk through the center of Damascus stopping at the Umayyad Mosque also known as the Great Mosque. One of the largest and oldest mosques in the world hosts the head of John the Baptist who is also venerated in Islam as Prophet Yahya. The relic was shown to the Russian leader who responded in the manner of a good guest presenting the mosque with a 17th-century copy of the Koran. The two leaders then headed to the oldest Orthodox church in Syria the Mariamite Cathedral built during the second century. It’s the seat of John X the Patriarch of Antioch and All the East who greeted the high-ranked guests. The Patriarch thanked Putin for sending the Russian military to assist Syria in the fight against terrorists. Without this help the church could’ve now been the headquarters of Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi or some militant warlord he said. John X also described Syria as a tolerant place “where different religions – both Christians and Muslims – coexist peacefully and enjoy the same rights.” The Russian president had a gift for him as well an icon of the Virgin Mary painted in Russia. After a brief but busy stay in Damascus Putin flew to neighboring Turkey where he is scheduled to hold security and trade talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and attend the ceremonial opening of the ‘Turk Stream’ gas pipeline.

236,None,Paltrow’s medical faddism “does real harm” by contributing to the “erosion of critical thinking” University of Alberta researcher Tim Caulfield tweeted on Monday after Netflix posted a teaser for the premiere of “The Goop Lab” later this month setting off a firestorm of panic among a certain stripe of science enthusiast. The idea of an entire show devoted to whatever bizarre health practices the actress can dredge up from obscurity - the teaser mentioned psychic readings exorcisms and “cold therapy” - has triggered calls for its cancellation from skeptics who fear an outbreak of 'monkey see monkey do' among its audience. Caulfield wrote a whole article last month eviscerating the celebrity “wellness” industry insisting that while it might seem like a relatively harmless form of profiteering it actually gives cover to scientifically-unproven health practices. Non-pharmaceutical procedures like cryotherapy gluten-free dieting and IV vitamin therapy - to say nothing of the jade egg that made Goop a household name - would be utterly obscure if not for their celebrity boosters he argued accusing celebrities of contributing to a “culture of untruth” and confusing people about what a “healthy lifestyle” entails.But pharmaceutical companies - FDA-approved drugs being the preferred route to health for many critics of Paltrow and other celebrity wellness gurus - spend over $6.4 billion advertising their products to customers every year. Some of these ads use celebrities - who can forget then-presidential candidate Bob Dole’s star turn in that Viagra ad or Olympic athlete Bruce (now Caitlin) Jenner’s fulsome praise of painkiller Vioxx on the Larry King show?  Vioxx may have gone on to kill tens of thousands of people but at least they weren’t taken in by some snake-oil seller like Goop. Surely Americans should have the right to choose whether they’d prefer to pop pills juice or shove a jade egg where the sun doesn’t shine? Not to Caulfield and the others who joined him in speaking out against The Goop Lab. An absence of critical thinking and a favorable feeling for celebrity anecdotes have combined to short-circuit our natural skepticism he insists going so far as to link the Goop craze with the “fake news” epidemic. Indeed he’s written an entire book slamming Paltrow and Goop - apparently hoping readers will stop uncritically listening to and funneling money to celebrity wellness gurus and start uncritically listening to and funneling money to him instead. It’s a microcosm of the “fake news” epidemic in general which exists largely in the minds of establishment journalists angry when their audiences prefer competing narratives. A change.org petition apparently launched last year when the show was first proposed warns that Goop is scaring people away from vaccinating their children and warns that a measles “epidemic” underway in Washington at the time would worsen if people take the celebrity’s advice. Ironically the petition features an image of a baby suffering a rash in reaction to receiving the smallpox vaccine - though it had been erroneously passed off as a child with measles by CNN. Paltrow is routinely excoriated for introducing the world to “holistic health psychiatrist” Kelly Brogan who espouses a link between vaccines and autism in 2018 even though the Goop website dismisses the vaccine-autism link as a “conspiracy theory” in the only vaccine-related article it has published. The petition author isn’t the only one to draw a direct causal line between Paltrow’s show and declining enthusiasm for vaccines - some went even further and suggested children would die of vaccine-preventable diseases if The Goop Lab was allowed to air. Others (accidentally) admitted that real scientists already have health shows and that those are carried by Netflix already. While the common line seemed to be that the bizarre treatments publicized by Goop were “harmful” even predatory… …some pointed out that not all “medical” treatments were particularly scientific or healthy either. Paltrow’s show may give a voice to the most ridiculous pseudoscience but censoring it “because harm” is a step down a slippery slope that ends in barring coverage of all treatments that fall outside the scope of orthodox medicine from the airwaves. Every medical innovation has faced doubt before becoming widely accepted - better to beef up one’s own critical thinking abilities than impose censorship in service to the lowest common denominator.

237,None,“Multiple sites” have come under attack by Iranian ballistic and cruise missiles Fox News reported citing anonymous Pentagon officials. There has been no official confirmation from the US Department of Defense. Iranian news agency FARS reported the launch of multiple missiles in “revenge” for last week’s drone strike that assassinated IRGC Quds Force head General Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad international airport along with several leaders of the Iraqi Shia militia. Anonymous Pentagon officials claim the missiles came from Iranian soil which would be a first since the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988. The attacks come after US President Donald Trump ruled out any US withdrawal from Iraq contrary to a letter that was sent to the government in Baghdad on Monday by a regional US commander.  Pulling out would turn the country over to Iran Trump said. He also threatened Iran with “tremendous” strikes if it dared attack US forces.

Saeed Jalili an adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took to Twitter soon after the strikes to taunt US President Donald Trump posting a lone image of an Iranian flag just as Trump did with an American flag the night Soleimani was killed.  Iran's telecommunications minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi also weighed in with a tweet insisting that Washington “Get the hell out of our region!” Iran threatened “hard revenge” against the US for Soleimani’s death. The leader of IRGC’s Quds Force was assassinated in a drone strike last Thursday outside Baghdad international airport in Iraq. The strike on Al-Asad and several other US bases in Iraq took place at 01:20 local time the exact time Soleimani’s convoy was struck. President Trump called Soleimani a “monster” and a terrorist whose death saved lives and threatened Iran with “disproportionate” US strikes if it endangered any Americans anywhere.  Trump also ruled out US withdrawal from Iraq contrary to a letter that was sent to the government in Baghdad on Monday by a regional US commander saying that doing so would practically hand the country over to Tehran.

The Iranian strikes come in response to the assassination of top general and Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani who was killed in a US strike in Baghdad late last week. Tehran has deemed the killing an act of “international terrorism” and promised to take revenge.

The statement according to Tasnim news agency also said that Tehran sees no difference between the “Zionist regime” – meaning Israel – and the US when it comes to the “crime” of assassinating Soleimani. This was presumably in reaction to reports that Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu was trying to disassociate from the strike calling it a purely American affair. The IRGC also put any regional US allies – such as Kuwait Jordan Saudi Arabia or Bahrain – on notice that their territory will be targeted if US bases on their soil are used to carry out strikes against Iran. On Tuesday Tehran designated the entire US military as a terrorist organization mirroring last year’s US designation of the IRGC as such. Like this story?

251,None,Putin’s visit was scheduled in advance and involved the ceremonial opening of ‘Turk Stream’ a natural gas pipeline running under the Black Sea from Russia to Turkey. He was also scheduled to meet with Erdogan in Istanbul and discuss the security situation in the region. However Iraq suddenly shot to the top of the agenda overnight as Iran fired off two volleys of missiles at US bases in retaliation for the US drone strike that killed Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps General Qassem Soleimani at a Baghdad airport last week.  As night fell in Washington it looked like neither the US nor Iran wanted to escalate things beyond that but a possible hot war between the two is certainly a cause for concern to both Moscow and Ankara. “Our region is tired of constant clashes from the intervention of external forces” Erdogan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told reporters earlier in the week adding that Turkey urged both Iran and the US to “reduce tensions.” Another hot topic is Erdogan’s decision to intervene in Libya. Turkey is seeking to prop up the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli the internationally recognized regime that has been reduced to control over the capital while the Libyan National Army (LNA) of General Khalifa Haftar holds most of the rest of the country. Haftar has declared jihad in response and vowed to drive out all foreign “invaders.” Erdogan and Putin also don’t see entirely eye to eye on Syria. The Turkish leader has been unhappy about the Syrian Army’s drive into Idlib the last remaining stronghold of the Turkish-backed “moderate rebels” that include Al-Qaeda affiliates. Kalin said that Turkey does not see President Bashar Assad as “the leader capable of taking the country into the future.” Russia on the other hand backs the government in Damascus where Putin stopped for a brief surprise visit on Tuesday.

255,None,"On Wednesday the Boeing 737-800 bound for Ukraine’s capital Kiev crashed after departing from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport. The plane was reportedly carrying 167 passengers from Canada Iran Sweden Afghanistan Germany and the UK as well as 11 Ukrainian citizens as well as nine crew members the country's national security council confirmed. Shortly after the crash Ukraine International Airlines announced it is suspending all flights to Tehran. In its statement the company said that the plane underwent its last scheduled maintenance on Monday. An investigation is already underway to determine the cause of the crash and representatives from UIA are in direct contact with the families of those affected. The airline also declined to comment on rumors that the plane was shot down. Ukrainian authorities later announced that Kiev is banning flights over Iran from January 9 until the causes of the tragedy are clarified. “As soon as the causes are clarified the decision will certainly be reconsidered” Ukrainian Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk said. European carriers started rerouting flights crossing the Middle East amid escalating tensions between the US and Iran. Air France said on Wednesday it is suspending all flights over Iran and Iraq the company told Sputnik. Meanwhile German’s Lufthansa said it had canceled its flight from Frankfurt to Tehran on Wednesday over situation in the region. The company later changed its mind and decided to resume flights to the Iranian capital starting Thursday but added that its group airlines would continue to fly around Iranian and Iraqi airspace. The Russian aviation agency Rosaviatsia sent an official recommendation to all domestic airlines to avoid flying over Iran Iraq the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The agency explained the move citing “existing risks for the safety of international civil flights.” Some companies have already done so; Ural Airlines rerouted flights crossing Iran on Wednesday according to TASS. Russia’s S7 carrier said it is looking into changing the route of its flight from Russia's Novosibirsk to Dubai to abide by the recommendation. Russian major air carrier Aeroflot as well its subsidiaries Pobeda and Rossiya Airlines has already developed some alternative routes. Another company Utair rerouted some of its flights to fly over Egypt and Cyprus instead.  One of the major Kazakh airlines Air Astana as well as a smallerSCAT Airlines are also avoiding Iranian and Iraqi airspace. Kazakh airlines altered the route of its Dubai-bound flights from the nation's capital of Nur-Sultan and the city of Astana. Earlier in the day the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would ban US carriers from operating over Iraq Iran and some Persian Gulf airspace after Iran attacked US facilities in Iraq. The agency said the restrictions were issued “due to heightened military activities and increased political tensions in the Middle East which present an inadvertent risk to US civil aviation operations."" Shortly after the US's non-binding warning Australian carrier Qantas decided to divert some flights to Europe until further notice. Qantas’ non-stop flights between Perth to London frequently fly over Iran and Iraq and they were redirected to go over Afghanistan instead. At the same time Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines said that their aircraft would avoid Iranian airspace.  Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

256,None,Delivered to UIA in 2016 the Boeing 737-800 was “in excellent condition” before its last flight from Tehran to Kiev Evgeny Dykhne the company’s president told reporters in Kiev also describing the aircraft as “one of the best.” UIA flight director Ihor Sosnovsky ruled out a pilot error saying the ill-fated flight was manned by a reinforced crew comprising Captain Volodymyr Yaponenko Pilot Instructor Oleksiy Naumkin and First Officer Serhiy Khomenko. “Given their experience it is very hard to say that something was wrong with them” he insisted. There were six flight attendants on the plane and the entire crew had had enough rest before departing from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini airport Sosnovsky added. The airline had also undergone scheduled maintenance just two days before the crash on Wednesday which killed 167 passengers and nine crew. Most of the passengers were making connecting flights via Kiev’s Boryspil airport the main hub of UIA. There were citizens of Iran Canada Germany the UK Sweden and Afghanistan among the victims.  UIA’s 737-800 which belongs to the troubled family of Boeing’s single-aisle medium-haul jets was less than four years old according to Flightradar. Nevertheless it was extensively used by the airline completing up to four flights a day. Founded in 1992 as the country’s flag carrier UIA connects Ukraine with 38 countries in Europe Asia Africa and the Americas. Although the airline describes itself as a “low-fare network carrier” it hadn’t lost single plane in accidents or incidents in recent decades. Today’s tragedy in Iran which left 176 people dead was UIA’s first crash breaking its relatively good safety record. It also represented more bad news for Boeing which is struggling to repair its reputation after its newest 737 MAX plane killed 346 people in two separate crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia last year. The manufacturer has been accused of failing to inform pilots and industry stakeholders about a new potentially dangerous flight control feature on the MAX planes. In the wake of the tragedy the airline suspended all flights to and from Imam Khomeini.

258,None,In 1879 astronomer Benjamin Gould discovered a long cloud of dust and gas the remnants of interconnected stellar nurseries stretching 3000 light years across which later became known as Gould’s Belt. After recent readings were taken by the Gaia mapping survey however it turns out Gould’s Belt is part of an even larger structure the largest of its kind ever discovered in our Milky Way galaxy.  According to scientific models the new structure is a wave of gas and dust that measures 9000 light-years long 400 light-years wide and extends 500 light-years above and below the galactic plane.  It has been dubbed the Radcliffe Wave after Harvard University’s Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study which analyzed the data from the mapping survey. “No astronomer expected that we live next to a giant wave-like collection of gas or that it forms the local arm of the Milky Way” said astronomer Alyssa Goodman of the Smithsonian Institution. Goodman said that both she and her team were “completely shocked when we first realised how long and straight the Radcliffe Wave is” when viewed from above.  “The Wave’s very existence is forcing us to rethink our understanding of the Milky Way’s 3D structure.” While it is the largest gaseous structure identified in the Milky Way it is far from the largest object we have observed. Fermi gamma-ray bubbles for example stretch some 50000 light-years.  The Gaia satellite was launched in 2013 tasked with producing the most accurate 3D map yet of our home galaxy so if any of our endeavors into space were going to come across the Radcliffe Wave this was it.  “The Sun lies only 500 light-years from the Wave at its closest point. It’s been right in front of our eyes all the time but we couldn’t see it until now” explained physicist and astronomer João Alves of the University of Vienna in Austria who postulates that the shape may be the result of some massive object interacting with our galaxy creating a ripple in our cosmic pond.

Other countries from outside have tried to make use of it to interfere starting from Iraq.” Buried under the Black Sea the TurkStream pipeline has a capacity of 31.5 billion cubic meters and its two lines supply Turkey as well as southern and southeastern Europe. The pipeline was completed in the face of the United States threatening sanctions and reduces Europe’s reliance on gas transited through Ukraine.  With Russian gas flowing to Turkish shores and onward to Bulgaria Serbia and Hungary will also receive gas once new pipelines are constructed.

269,None,"Police responded to reports of “many injuries” at the scene prompting the Canadian parliament’s security team to issue an ""active shooter"" warning to its employees. The incident unfolded on Gilmour Street and officers tweeted that a “coordinated response” was underway.  One person was confirmed dead at the scene and three others were taken to hospital “in serious condition suffering from gunshot wounds.” Police also said one of the injured was a minor who was taken to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario.  As the incident unfolded the Parliament of Canada Protective Service sent an alert to federal employees warning of an ""active shooter"" at large. An investigation into the shooting is underway and police say though the shooter remains at large ""this is not considered an active shooter situation"" and the area has been secured. Police told CBC that they believe the shooting was targeted. ​All four victims in the shooting were male. Some French Catholic schools in downtown Ottawa were temporarily placed in ""safe school mode"" in response to the shooting. The CECCE a network of French-language Catholic schools said on Twitter that all students and staff were safe and it was decided only as a ""preventive measure."" In a statement released before 11am police said they were ""seeking public assistance"" and tips to identify and locate the suspect involved in the shooting. Police told media that they do not have a description of the suspect and that officers are going door-to-door in the area seeking more information.

270,None,A Paris court decided on Wednesday that the former leader will stand trial from October 5 to 22 according to AFP. It will be the first trial in several graft cases against the 64-year-old who will be the first ex-president of France to stand trial on corruption charges. Sarkozy is suspected of attempting to obtain secret information from ex-high magistrate Gilbert Azibert in early 2014 through his lawyer Thierry Herzog. Herzog and Azibert will also stand trial. The case focuses on conversations between Herzog and Azibert that were tapped by investigators probing claims that Sarkozy had accepted illicit payments from the L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt for his 2007 presidential campaign. Sarkozy who was president from 2007 to 2012 fought to prevent the case from going to trial but his final bid failed last June. Since losing the presidency Sarkozy has faced a slew of corruption and campaign financing allegations. In October 2019 a court ruled he must stand trial for illicit campaign financing. If found guilty he could face a one-year jail term and a fine. Prosecutors in that case say the ex-president used fake invoices to spend nearly €43 million euros ($40 million) on his failed 2012 re-election bid - almost twice the legal limit. Sarkozy has also been charged over accusations he accepted millions of euros in donations from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. He denies all the allegations against him. Like this story?

271,None,"Two waves of Iranian missiles rained down overnight on two military installations housing US and coalition troops one in Al-Asad and one in Erbil. The strikes were heavy on symbolism with Iranian leadership making sure that the US gets the message right. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the attack – codenamed 'Martyr Soleimani' after the slain commander of Iran's clandestine Quds Force – was ""a slap in the face"" for the US. Echoing his words President Hassan Rouhani said Tehran's ""final answer"" to Soleimani's killing would be to ""kick all US forces out of the region."" Washington has been conspicuously mute in the aftermath of the missile attack. While Donald Trump optimistically wrote that all was ""well"" by Wednesday morning there was no mutual exchange of threats unlike earlier this week. As the world braces itself for what may come RT reached out to some international pundits who revealed noteworthy details about the strikes and tried to foresee what the future holds.  One of the targets for the attack was an airbase visited by both President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence ""so it has this kind of symbolism"" Middle East-based journalist and writer Ali Rizk told RT. Iran has ""numerous allies in Iraq"" which represents ""the easiest place"" to carry out a retaliatory strike and ""make life difficult for the Americans."" Notably enough Baghdad didn't protest against the strikes with Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi revealing that he'd received a verbal message from Iran warning of their response to the assassination of Soleimani with a reassurance that it would be restricted to US military deployed in Iraq. Operation 'Martyr Soleimani' made headlines in international media but it's unclear up to the time of writing if it inflicted any losses on US and Western forces. The bases in question were already put on alert as were all other American facilities across Iraq. ""The ball is in the US' [court] right now. It can lick its wounds and end this or it can retaliate in which case there will be tit-for-tat spiraling out of control into an all-out war which is not in the interests of Iran or the United States or anybody else in the region"" Kaveh Afrasiabi a US-based academic who advised Iranian negotiators during previous nuclear talks told RT. US-Iran relations are at a ""very critical threshold"" Afrasiabi added. Trump who vowed to make a statement on Thursday morning now faces ""important decisions"" which could shape the Middle East for years to come. Some hardliners including Senator Lindsey Graham (Rep-SC) called Iran's revenge ""an act of war"" while Senator Marco Rubio (Rep-FL) called on Americans to ""respond appropriately."" This risks ratcheting up the conflict with Iran the analyst noted. Dan Kovalik peace activist and labor attorney was much more pessimistic suggesting the Soleimani assassination was actually an attempt to force Iran into taking the first shots of war. ""Truthfully I believe that the murder of General Soleimani was done in order to provoke this type of response [from Iran]. The people in charge of the US government at this point want a war with Iran and they were looking to create a provocation"" he argued. The attacks were ""carefully calibrated"" to avoid major escalation in the aftermath suggested Sreeram Chaulia a professor and dean at India's Jindal School of International Affairs. Iranians don't want the kind of confrontation in which US troops will stay in the region indefinitely thus putting pressure on Iran's security. They believe they can outperform the Americans in the long run Chaulia explained. ""The idea is that eventually they can run out the clock and the Americans will leave"" he said referring to a Pentagon leak saying it was ready to reposition their forces and withdraw from Iraq. At the moment Tehran is holding back ""because one they don't want war as they clearly said but two they take smaller actions of this sort continuously.""  Top Iranian officials called the attack ""a proportionate response"" to Soleimani's assassination but in the meantime they signaled that any coercive action will be met with force.

272,None,"I did not escape justice. I fled injustice and political persecution” Ghosn told a conference room packed with international journalists in Beirut Lebanon. The businessman who was due to face trial for embezzlement and under-reporting his income in Japan said that fleeing the country was “the most difficult decision” of his life. However he said that he had no other choice as his family was allegedly in danger. Ghosn claims that Japanese officials told him: “It will be over if you just confess. If you don’t confess not only are we going to go after you we are going to go after your family.”  He said he was treated “brutally” by police who “spent 14 months trying to break my spirit barring any contact with my wife.” The businessman with French Lebanese and Brazilian nationality who essentially saved Nissan from bankruptcy two decades ago disappointed the press by saying he wasn’t planning to reveal how he managed to escape from Japan before the New Year. Some reports claim that Ghosn who had been under house arrest since spring of last year used public transport to get from Tokyo to Osaka where he was carried aboard a private jet inside a crate used for transporting musical instruments.  “I am here to talk about why I left” the 65-year-old pointed out blaming the Japanese justice system for violating his basic human rights and being particularly strict on foreigners. He said all charges against him were “baseless” and claimed that the real reason for his persecution was his work to deepen the alliance between Nissan and French car-maker Renault. “Some of my Japanese friends thought that the only way to get rid of the influence of Renault on Nissan was to get rid of me” he explained.  He claims his arrest was a result of “collusion between Nissan and the prosecutors” who did what the company told them. The businessman said he was eager to clear his name and find justice elsewhere if it was impossible to do so in Japan. Tokyo prosecutors were left unimpressed with Ghosn’s press-conference saying that the man was unable to justify his escape from the country. They also branded the businessman’s allegations of conspiracy between them and Nissan as “false.” Instead the prosecutors insisted that Ghosn had only himself to blame for his troubles and vowed to keep working to bring him back to Japan for trial.

In Iraq two American military bases are hit by dozens of airstrikes as Iran responds to the killing of its top general who was assassinated in a US drone strike last week. However Tehran says it's not looking for a war with Washington. 'All is well' - that's how Donald Trump responds to the attacks saying he will give more details later. He had previously threatened to destroy multiple Iranian sites including cultural if Iran retaliated in anyway.  A Ukrainian passenger plane has crashed near Tehran airport.

Mark Latunski is charged with open murder and mutilation of a body after reportedly confessing to stabbing 25-year-old Kevin Bacon in the back slitting his throat and hanging him by his ankles from the rafters of his home in Morrice - only to later cut off and eat the dead man’s testicles. Latunski’s lawyer has filed an insanity plea citing a history of mental illness including four court-ordered stays in an institution. Latunski believes he is a member of a royal family from Wales with another name his lawyer claimed on Wednesday. The judge has ordered a forensic evaluation. Bacon a hairstylist met Latunski on Christmas Eve through Grindr and was reported missing by his family the next morning when he failed to turn up for Christmas breakfast. His car was found near his home with his belongings inside – including his phone which allowed police to trace his likely location based on conversations with Latunski on the app. Police found his body still hanging from the rafters of Latunski’s home on December 28 and arrested the confessed cannibal. Michigan State Police have widened the scope of their investigation to include two other recent incidents at Latunski’s home and the FBI has also gotten involved. In November police were called to the residence after a 29-year-old man was seen running from the scene with blood on his face screaming for help and clad only in a leather kilt - but the man didn’t press charges and it was determined at the time that no crime had been committed. A man from New York had fled the home the previous month and called police in a similar case but no charges were filed then either. Latunski was charged with kidnapping in 2013 for allegedly absconding with two of the four children he had with his ex-wife but that case was dismissed. Like this story?

Following a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul on Wednesday Moscow and Ankara released a joint statement calling on all sides in the Libyan conflict to declare a sustainable ceasefire supported by the necessary measures to be taken for stabilizing the situation on the ground and normalizing daily life in Tripoli and other cities."" READ MORE: Turkish troops start moving toward Libya – Erdogan Libya is currently contested by the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) and the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR) the latter backed up by General Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA).  Haftar’s forces spent much of 2019 advancing west toward Tripoli at one point threatening to storm the capital. Turkey intervened on the side of the GNA last week and began sending ground troops toward the North African nation over the weekend under the auspices of providing “coordination and stability” for the UN-backed GNA government. Russia has been careful not to pick sides despite talks with Haftar in Moscow earlier in the year. The Russian government nonetheless criticized Turkey’s siding with the GNA with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stating late last month that “foreign interference will hardly help the situation.”  Ankara has ruled out the possibility of clashing with Russia in Libya with Erdogan adviser and Chief EU negotiator Omer Celik saying on Monday it was “out of the question.” Erdogan’s decision to send troops led Haftar to declare “jihad” on Turkey and the general vowed to throw the “invaders” out of his country. Meanwhile the Tobruk parliament cut all diplomatic ties with Turkey and accused GNA Prime Minister Fayez Al-Sarraj of treason for inviting Turkish forces in. Once an oil-rich and prosperous nation Libya remains fractured and devastated since longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed by rebel forces in 2011 with the backing of a NATO bombing campaign. With Gaddafi removed the country degenerated into a no-man’s-land blighted by militia clashes jihadism and human trafficking. A Russia-Turkey brokered ceasefire in Libya would be “very difficult” to make happen because while the main conflict is between two players — Haftar’s forces and the UN-backed Sarraj government — it’s “more complicated” than that since there are additional forces at play including ISIS and other warlords political analyst Chris Bambery told RT. Bambery said that the UN-backed government is only “hanging on in a coastal strip of the country” and has “very little control” over Libya. Therefore it would be unlikely to see Haftar’s side backing off just when it appears to be nearing victory he said. Still Russia and Turkey do hold “some sway” in Libya and both seem keen to pull the ceasefire off he added. The situation may also be complicated by the fact that other international players are also involved including Haftar-backers Egypt and Saudi Arabia which Bambery said may not be interested in paying attention to a deal brokered between Moscow and Ankara.

273,None,In recent years NASA scientists have been perplexed by matter that seemed to be traveling so fast that it appeared to break the laws of physics. However now thanks to the photogenic black hole at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy they have finally gotten to the bottom of the mind-bending celestial speed demon.  The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration released images of the black hole the first ever photographed to much fanfare last April. While sifting through data from observations made in 2012 and 2017 scientists from the international partnership observed a jet of high energy particles and matter being blasted from the center of the black hole at apparent speeds of 6.3 times and 2.4 times the speed of light. Now this black hole located some 55 million light years away is truly gargantuan with a mass of about 6.5 billion times that of the sun so its gravity packs quite a punch but surely not one that could defy the laws of the universe itself?  Boffins have finally unraveled the peculiar mystery and the answer lies in a strange occurrence called superluminal motion. “One of the unbreakable laws of physics is that nothing can move faster than the speed of light” explained one of the paper’s co-authors Brad Snios of the Harvard &amp; Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). “We haven’t broken physics but we have found an example of an amazing phenomenon called superluminal motion.”  Superluminal motion occurs when an object is close to our line of sight making it look like it is somehow breaking the laws of physics because the source of the light appears to constantly overtake the incoming light as we observe it.  The incredible speeds were clocked through analysis of the particle stream in radio optical wavelengths. But when researchers using Chandra’s x-ray instruments tracked two beams blasted from the black hole at relativistic speeds about 900 and 2500 light years away from the region they were able to crack the mystery.  Using this “cosmic speed gun” method the scientists discovered that the particles could travel at more than 99 percent of the speed of light but they could not outrun physics itself. “It’s like the Event Horizon Telescope is giving a close-up view of a rocket launcher” said the CfA’s Paul Nulsen another co-author of the study “and Chandra is showing us the rockets in flight.”  Like this story?

274,None,Liridon Saliuka 29 who was born in Kosovo and held a British passport was reportedly found unresponsive in his prison cell on the evening of January 2. An investigation has been launched and it’s understood that authorities are treating his death as self-inflicted which his family disputes. He’s the third prisoner to have died in Belmarsh in less than a year. A fellow inmate was found dead in the notorious London facility in November.  Saliuka’s family claim there have been delays to the postmortem. His sister Dita revealed that her brother was involved in a car crash two years ago that left him requiring major reconstructive surgery. He was given metal plates that made it hard for him to walk or stand for long periods of time. A report by a surgeon commissioned by his defense lawyer had determined that he should be considered as “permanently disabled.” However his family say he had recently been transferred from a special cell to a standard one. Belmarsh is also the prison where Assange is currently being held ahead of an extradition hearing. UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Nils Melzer sent a letter to the UK government in December asking it to end the detention of Assange and warned that his health may soon reach a “critical” stage including the risk of death.

275,None,Speaking from the White House Trump backed away from threatening further strikes against Iran describing Tehran’s stand-down as “a good thing for all parties concerned.” Trump did however vow to impose new economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic in addition to the thousand or so imposed since the US withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA or Iran nuclear deal) in 2018. “These powerful sanctions will remain” he said “until Iran changes its behavior.” “Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism” Trump continued. “Time has come for the United Kingdom Germany France Russia and China to recognize this reality. They must now break away from the remnants of the JCPOA.” While Trump recently declared that the US would wipe out 52 Iranian state and cultural targets if American interests were attacked he struck a more conciliatory tone in his speech on Wednesday. After boasting about America’s “big missiles” Trump suggested that under a new deal Iran could become a “great country” and could cooperate with the US on areas of mutual benefit. “ISIS [Islamic State IS ISIL] is the natural enemy of Iran” he said. “The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran. And we should work together on this and many other shared priorities.” Early on Wednesday Iran rained a barrage of missiles on two military bases used by American troops in Iraq. The missile attack came in response to the drone assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani by the US in Baghdad on Friday. Soleimani according to Washington had orchestrated a series of attacks on American forces in Iraq and was allegedly plotting further strikes through Iranian-backed militias in the country. Tehran called the killing an act of “international terrorism” vowing to take revenge. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif described the missile attack as a “proportionate measure” taken in self-defense. Zarif added that Tehran does not intend to escalate the situation further but would target US allies in the region if Washington responds with force. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the strikes served as a “slap in the face” for the United States but were not “sufficient” to remove “the corrupting presence of America in the region.” READ MORE: Kicking all US troops out of Middle East will be Iran’s ‘final answer’ to Soleimani’s assassination – Rouhani Like this story?

276,None,After Iranian missiles struck several US bases Tuesday night #Resistance twitter wasted no time disavowing the administration they blamed for the hostilities running into the arms of his arch-rival with the #IVotedforHillaryClinton hashtag. But claiming Clinton was the less warlike of the two candidates or would have steered the country away from war with Iran requires a serious divergence from history. The former Secretary of State once told an interviewer that “I want the Iranians to know that if I’m the president we will attack Iran.” That was during her 2008 campaign and in the middle of a discussion about Iran possibly attacking Israel. Perhaps her stance on the Islamic republic had softened a bit by 2016 enough to justify viewing her as the lesser of two Iran hawks? Nope. The months leading up to that election saw her parroting Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s decades-old talking points about Iran “racing toward a nuclear capability” expanding “secret facilities” and “defying their international obligations” before she swept in with the nuclear deal and solved all the problems.  Except the deal was negotiated after she was replaced as the top US diplomat by John Kerry. Clinton was on the same side as Trump demanding ever more sanctions even as the nuclear deal took effect this time as punishment for Iran’s ballistic missile program.  Beyond interventionist Democrats she was courted by a bevy of neocons who couldn’t stomach Trump’s anti-interventionist rhetoric. Inveterate warmongers like Robert Kagan and Richard Armitage swooned over the ex-First Lady.  In short order the infamous clip of Clinton mocking the brutal murder of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi – “we came we saw he died” – resurfaced on twitter. The so-called “humanitarian” intervention in Libya was largely a creation of Clinton’s State Department complete with risible wartime propaganda about Gaddafi handing out Viagra so his soldiers could better commit mass rapes and the continued chaos in that once-advanced state remains a testament to what the region (or world) might look like under her watch. She wanted a repeat performance in Syria calling for - and thankfully not getting - a no-fly zone even while admitting it would “kill a lot of Syrians.”  With all that in mind some speculated the true motive of the hashtag was avoiding responsibility.  Several tweeters agreed that Clinton was right about Trump - but in a case of the pot calling the kettle black. A few Clinton voters even aired their buyers’ remorse. Clinton herself couldn't resist weighing in with a smug GIF. While Trump lost the popular vote to Clinton he handily beat her in the Electoral College which ultimately decides who occupies the White House. Despite her massive advantage in political experience his promises to bring US troops home attracted significant support. Nearly four years later however the US is poised on the brink of a catastrophic expansion of its Forever War. Like this story?

277,None,A black SUV smashed into the portal of the church in the town of Sonseca in the central Toledo province early on Wednesday. The massive wooden doors withstood the initial impact while one passer-by thought that a crash had happened and approached the driver to ask about his condition.   But the man behind the wheel shouted obscenities at her and continued his attempts to get his car into the place of worship. The scared woman ran away and called the police. The doors eventually gave in and the powerful vehicle raced into the church throwing benches aside and stopping only a meter away from the altar. When officers arrived the unhinged driver told them that he was possessed by the devil and that the church was the only place where he could find shelter. He was identified as a local man who owned a shop celling products for cultivation of marijuana located just 800 meters away from the scene. The 35-year-old was hospitalized with minor injuries. Tests for alcohol and other substances were reportedly done on him but their results haven’t been yet revealed. Police sources said that the perpetrator may be put under arrest. Sonseca mayor Sergio Mora expressed relief that none of his citizens were wounded in the incident and offered the church assistance in the restoring the damage.

278,None,Al-Sadr made his pronouncement on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump gave a relatively subdued speech praising Iran’s restraint. Rather than call for retaliation against Iran over a strike that didn’t kill any Americans Trump merely vowed to impose even more sanctions on the Islamic Republic “until Iran changes its behavior.”  Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani in turn vowed to eventually kick all US troops “out of the region” as the “final answer” to the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani killed in a US airstrike last week. Shia religious leader al-Sadr also called on Iraqi militias to be “patient” and not begin any military actions claiming that a new “strong” government capable of protecting Iraq’s sovereignty would be formed in 15 days and hold early elections. However Iraq should still evict the foreign troops inside its borders he said. The Iraqi foreign ministry condemned Iran’s missile attack on the coalition bases declaring it a “violation of Iraqi sovereignty” in a statement on Wednesday and emphasizing Iraq was an “independent state.”  “We will not allow it to become a battlefield” the ministry added. Iraqi PM Adel Abdul Mahdi stepped down last month after months of massive protests calling for electoral reforms. He has remained in a “caretaker” role while Iraq’s political leaders attempt to move forward. Another prominent Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani warned last month that “foreign interference” in the process would not be tolerated. Like this story?

280,None,Trump backed away from the idea of striking Iran in a much-anticipated address on Wednesday as the two nations seemed to be on the brink of war over the US killing of top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. He did however double down on promises of more crippling sanctions. Paul told RT that while Trump’s decision not to escalate militarily was positive problems and dangers still exist because the president has “too many neocons around him trying to aggravate things.” He also called US sanctions on Iran an “act of war” in themselves and said that Americans would be outraged if another country engaged in economic warfare and blockades against Washington. “There’s a war going on” already through sanctions he said. Paul reiterated his long-standing view that the US should pull its troops out of Iraq and said that the US’s “monstrosity of an embassy” in Baghdad was just “provoking” people into attacks on US personnel. The former congressman and libertarian said that the US should be “very engaged” in the world but through diplomacy and trade rather than military aggression. He also said the narrative of Iran as the aggressor or initiating force behind recent tensions is misleading because in its position it simply “can’t afford to be” an aggressor. Like this story?

281,None,Israel has been developing laser weapons since the mid-1990s yet the most promising such weapon – the US-Israeli-developed Nautilus Tactical High Energy Laser – was shelved in 2006 in favor of continued reliance on the Iron Dome missile batteries. However research has continued in the meantime and Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett announced on Wednesday that a functioning laser defense system will be operational within a year and a half. The system will use multiple laser beams focused together and will work in adverse weather conditions the Jerusalem Post reported. Bennett said that the system “makes the security apparatus more lethal more powerful and more advanced.” “We will add a laser sword when dealing with threats from the north or the south” the minister said adding “the enemies of Israel better not test our resolve or our abilities.” The Israeli government’s goal is to use the system against rockets such as the Qassam commonly fired into Israel from Gaza. Defense Ministry research head Yaniv Rotem told the Jerusalem Post that the laser has been tested on “mortar shells drones and anti-tank missiles” in recent years. Crucially laser weapons are far cheaper to operate than missile batteries. Every successful Iron Dome interception costs thousands of dollars whereas a laser weapon costs only what electricity is used. It is also expected to be effective against low-flying drones and incendiary kites and balloons like those used by Palestinain rioters to set fire to Israeli farmlands near the Gaza border. ‘Star Wars’ capabilities are unlikely to deter Israel’s enemies from launching attacks on the Jewish state however. Despite the Iron Dome limiting the effectiveness of rocket strikes and the Israeli military’s often disproportionate response to Palestinian violence anger among those living in the occupied territories still regularly results in clashes and death. The country’s long-standing enmity with Iran has also seen its cities threatened with missile fire. As the US and Tehran stood on the brink of war this week Iranian leadership threatened on Wednesday to launch missiles at Haifa should the US respond with force to an Iranian attack on American bases in Iraq. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded in kind threatening to deal Iran a “most crushing blow” were the Islamic Republic to target Israel. Think your friends would be interested?

282,None,“I believe based on what I saw and what I know that [the strikes] were intended to cause structural damage destroy vehicles and equipment and aircraft and to kill personnel” Army General Mark Milley told reporters on Wednesday. “That's my own personal assessment” he added. “But the analytics is in the hands of professional intelligence analysts. So they're looking at that.” Milley did not elaborate whether those were the same analysts who “assessed” the truthfulness of the now-debunked ‘Russiagate’ or the equally phantom existence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction used to justify the 2003 invasion.  The overnight attacks on Al-Asad airbase and Erbil involved over a dozen ballistic missiles fired by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in revenge for the US drone strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani one of the IRGC’s top commanders.  The Iraqi government confirmed that it had received advance warning about the strikes from Iran enabling US troops to take precautionary measures and activate their “finest in the world” air defenses. No lives were lost as a result.  Both Iran and the US declared victory and stood down on Wednesday morning with US President Donald Trump describing the outcome as “a good thing for all parties concerned.” It was a stunning turn from Tuesday’s hard line championed by Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and not everyone at the Pentagon seems happy about it if Milley’s comments are anything to go by. Pentagon officials sent to Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers on the almost-war apparently didn’t do too well either. Emerging from the classified briefing Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) gave a blistering denunciation of what he heard as “probably the worst briefing I've seen at least on a military issue” adding that the military could not name a single instance in which they would feel it necessary to ask for congressional approval. Exact details of the briefing are classified but Lee hinted that the military apparently told lawmakers that they could not debate or discuss the strike that killed Soleimani or whether a military intervention against Iran was legal as that would signal division and weakness to Tehran. “It is not acceptable for officials within the executive branch of government…to come in and tell us that we can't debate and discuss the appropriateness of military intervention against Iran” Lee fumed afterward. “It's un-American. It's unconstitutional and it's wrong.” Lee and fellow Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) said the briefing convinced them to change their mind and support the War Powers resolution proposed by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) Hillary Clinton’s 2016 running mate. Think your friends would be interested?

283,None,Air raid sirens can be heard in video footage presumably captured in the Iraqi capital on Wednesday night. Multiple journalists in the city reported that two explosions rang out apparently coming from the direction of the heavily-fortified ‘Green Zone’ home to the US embassy. Iraq’s military said that “two Katyusha rockets fell inside the Green Zone without causing casualties.” Police sources told Reuters that the rockets came within 100 meters of the US embassy and caused a fire. The Green Zone was besieged by protesters last week following an American strike on an Iraqi Shia militia group near the Syrian border that killed at least 25 fighters. Days later the US assassinated Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike at Baghdad airport driving the US and Iran to the brink of war. Following a retaliatory missile attack on two American bases in the early hours of Wednesday morning tensions simmered back down later in the day as US President Donald Trump opted not to respond with force.

284,None,Trudeau said Canada’s foreign minister would speak with his Iranian counterpart to discuss the need for a probe but added it would be “dangerous” to speculate about the cause of the crash at this early stage. Nonetheless he said he expected Canada would have a role in any investigation into the incident. The PM also noted that he had spoken to US President Donald Trump about the incident earlier on Wednesday. The Ukrainian flight – a Boeing 737-800 – went down over Tehran on Tuesday night after an apparent technical failure with Iranian officials stating the plane’s engine caught fire before it crashed. All 167 passengers as well as 9 crew members were killed. Insisting on carrying out its own independent probe Tehran earlier refused to hand the plane’s black box to Boeing but said Ukrainian officials will be allowed to be “present during investigations.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a team of experts would be dispatched to Iran to help determine the cause of the crash and to “establish the truth and those responsible for this terrible catastrophe.” While Kiev revoked its initial statement pinning the crash on an equipment malfunction without explanation Zelensky has also urged the public to refrain from speculating about what happened.

285,None,“Truth and Lies: Jeffrey Epstein” is due to air Thursday on ABC the network tweeted on Wednesday as the country stood poised on the brink of war with Iran and one might assume relatively few eyes were on the Epstein saga – for once. James O’Keeffe of Project Veritas was quick to take credit for the long-suppressed footage seeing daylight – assuming of course the special ABC plans to broadcast bears any resemblance to the investigation by anchor Amy Robach that was mysteriously spiked by network management three years ago. In November the conservative muckraker published a hot-mic tape of Robach ranting about ABC’s suppression of her work revealing the network had been sitting on a bombshell. Robach had interviewed Epstein victim Virginia Roberts who supposedly implicated former president Bill Clinton the UK’s Prince Andrew lawyer Alan Dershowitz and other big names – with photographic proof – and found other women to back up her story long before the Miami Herald investigation that reopened the case in December 2018. The news that the network had spiked such a significant investigation reverberated all the way up through Congress. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California) wrote to ABC requesting a copy of the interview with Roberts as well as information about why (and by whom) the story was killed. In a letter co-signed by two of McCarthy’s fellow Republicans he excoriated the network for prioritizing “financial interests” and “outside forces” over getting to the bottom of Epstein’s (alleged) human trafficking operation. The news that an Epstein special – perhaps the fabled Robach special (though the clips ABC posted tellingly included no trace of the anchor) was finally going to grace the network’s airwaves provoked excitement and trepidation on social media. Many assumed the network had been in overdrive since Veritas dropped the hot-mic tape editing the material to expunge any awkward revelations. Just the leak of the Robach tape provoked a mad scramble at the network to find and exile the leaker leading to the firing of an innocent woman from a rival network. Others guessed they would still find some way not to broadcast it. The well-connected sex offender may be dead but his secrets are very much alive after all. Like this story?

286,None,Speaking at the CES convention in Las Vegas on Wednesday Twitter’s director of product management Suzanne Xie announced they would be giving users a new “conversation participants” option sometime this year. The option will allow posters to set replies on their tweets from “global group panel and statement.” The options would control the ability of other users to reply ranging from anyone (global) to no one (statement) with only those mentioned (panel) or specifically selected (group) in between. Xie said that the feature is still in development and is an “experiment we’re going to run” in the first quarter of 2020 before launching it globally later in the year. The new feature is intended to limit the power of trolls and combat abuse according to the company. To that end Twitter has already given users the option of hiding replies stating that “everyone should feel safe and comfortable while talking on Twitter.” However this is still a manual process a laborious task for prolific figures on the platform – such as President Donald Trump for instance. With Twitter being all about discussion and argument the news angered many users who suggested that limiting replies could stifle debate and allow false information from politicians journalists and public figures to go unchecked. Progressive journalist Max Blumenthal mocked the idea as the “Elite Accountability Insulation button” designed to protect “Beltway hacks and foreign policy insiders.” “Powerful people don’t like being talked back to” conservative pundit Stephen Miller tweeted “so Twitter now just becomes a newspaper the medium it killed.” Should Trump protect his tweets with the “statement” option droves of #Resistance commenters who obsessively rain scorn on every one of his messages will likely be devastated. Twitter’s previous attempts to shape discussion on its platform have often been ham-fisted. Critics have long accused the company of secretly suppressing unsavory content a charge it vigorously denied. However a change to the site’s terms of service late last year for the first time acknowledged this stating that the firm may “limit distribution or visibility” of content and “suspend or terminate users” as it sees fit. Back in 2018 Twitter announced it would de-rank posts from what it called “troll accounts.” That was also met with controversy as critics accused the social media giant of censorship. The platform’s aggressive “hateful conduct” rules have also been slammed as biased and arbitrary. Like this story?

287,None,The Ain Al-Asad military base in Iraq’s Anbar province as well as another facility outside Erbil in the Iraqi Kurdistan found themselves under fire by two volleys of ballistic missiles fired from inside Iran during the night between Tuesday and Wednesday. Satellite imagery released on Wednesday by the private US company Planet Labs shows only minor damage in both places mostly to warehouses and equipment storage facilities rather than barracks. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) launched the missiles as revenge for the US drone strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani one of their top commanders last week outside of Baghdad. Despite belligerent rhetoric that accompanied the missiles Iran stood down after just two volleys claiming its legitimate self-defense objectives were met. US President Donald Trump likewise declared “all is well” declined to respond with force and commended Tehran’s decision as “a good thing for all parties concerned.” No US or Iraqi soldiers were killed in the strikes. The Pentagon claimed its early warning systems caught the launches allowing US troops to seek shelter. The Iraqi government revealed on Wednesday that Iran actually called and warned them of the strike in advance which they then passed on to Washington. Finland and Lithuania which also have troops stationed at the two bases also reportedly said they were informed of the strikes in advance. All of this has prompted speculation that the Iranian missile strikes were more of a symbolic act than a true escalation of the ongoing conflict between Tehran and Washington. Iran proved it had the capability to kill US troops if it so chose but deliberately refrained from it argued former US Marine and UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter. The top US general however claimed on Wednesday that his “personal assessment” was that the IRGC was shooting to kill. “I believe based on what I saw and what I know that [the strikes] were intended to cause structural damage destroy vehicles and equipment and aircraft and to kill personnel” Army General Mark Milley told reporters.

288,None,The suspects “conspired and conducted religious classes with the objective of establishing Islamic rule in India through violent jihad and promoting unlawful activities” India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) said in a statement on Wednesday. The accused were charged with criminal conspiracy for their role in the religious courses and most have already been taken into custody as part of an ongoing investigation the agency added. Dubbed the “Ansarullah case” – or “Supporters of God” in Arabic – the probe was first opened last July when investigators uncovered a burgeoning terror cell with links to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The cell proselytized a violent message through courses on how to wage “jihad” and create an Islamic “caliphate.” The group was also thought to have collected funds to finance a terror operation in India. Police raids in both India and the UAE last year led to the arrest of 16 suspects five of which were thought to have ties to the notorious Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS) terrorist outfit. It is unclear whether any of the 11 named in Wednesday’s charge sheet were affiliated with any other known militant groups. Like this story?

289,None,The spate of severe pneumonia cases may be linked to a family of microbes known as “coronaviruses” the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday adding that it would need to collect more data to confirm the suspicion. “The initial information about the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan ... pointed to a coronavirus as a possible pathogen causing this cluster” the WHO said in a statement referring to a city in eastern China where 59 cases of pneumonia have been observed in the last month. Coronaviruses encompass a wide range of ailments from the common cold all the way to SARS the deadly respiratory disease which swept dozens of countries in a series of flare-ups in the early 2000s. Though Chinese researchers have ruled out SARS in the recent outbreak – as well as bird flu adenovirus and other common respiratory infections – the WHO said a “novel coronavirus” currently unknown to science could instead be at work. Unlike SARS which spreads with relative ease Chinese scientists say the new bug does not appear to be exceptionally contagious one sign that another culprit is behind the upsurge in pneumonia. The same illness may have also spread to Hong Kong and South Korea with similar reports of respiratory infections from people who recently traveled to Wuhan. Fifteen such patients are now being treated in Hong Kong with only one known case in South Korea. Because of the rash of infections the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert on Wednesday urging physicians around the world to watch out for the novel coronavirus especially in patients exhibiting pneumonia-like symptoms.

291,None,Asked about India’s pursuit of the S-400s during a press briefing on Wednesday a senior State Department official said the country enjoyed no special protection from US sanctions which Washington has also threatened to impose on Turkey over its own purchase of the missile platform. “There is not a blanket waiver. Congress certainly never designed that or anticipated that nor did the administration” he said adding:  Immediately following the low-key threat however the official noted there was no “blanket application” for sanctions on India either suggesting they would be applied on a “case-by-case” basis and could in theory be adjusted to be less “deep-cutting.” Any penalties on New Delhi would be imposed under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act – CAATSA for the short of breath – which was signed into law in 2017. Despite the bill’s name Washington has largely brandished the act as a warning to allied nations mulling weapons deals with Russia – namely Turkey and India – but has occasionally used it against so-called “adversaries” hitting China with secondary CAATSA sanctions in 2018. India has insisted that it be left to make its own arms purchases independently with the country’s external affairs minister stressing last November that New Delhi would “not be influenced by other countries on what we do in terms of our national security and defense.” The S-400 is Russia’s most advanced long-range air defense system available for export designed to intercept enemy aircraft and missiles. Washington argues the platform is ‘not compatible’ with NATO defense infrastructure and claims it poses a ‘threat’ to its 5th-gen F-35 stealth fighter jet. Like this story?

Kiev has already dispatched investigators to Iran according to reports. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry revealed that the crash victims included 82 Iranians 11 Ukrainians 63 Canadians four Afghans three Germans three British nationals and 10 Swedes. The crash occurred shortly after an Iranian missile attack on US bases in Iraq prompting theories that Tehran may have accidentally shot down the plane.

He is entitled to a public defender and that is being arranged” said police spokesman Ewa-Gun Westford. Swedish paper Expressen recorded Alasaad with a hidden camera joking about how he had smuggled several people into Sweden for money after entering the country along the smuggling route from Turkey and offering to help smuggle a child from Greece to Sweden.  “Yes I got my whole family out. I got a lot of people out. It’s not difficult at all” Alasaad said on camera. “Let me tell you why I’m doing it. To be honest the main reason is money. I want money.” Sweden’s Border Police launched an initial inquiry after the video was made public. He initially denied the allegations but when confronted about a suspected price list 20000 Swedish krona (approximately €1900) per child and 30000 krona (€2860) per adult Alasaad admitted the list was authentic.  He also reportedly ran Facebook ads under a fake name offering to smuggle migrants from Greece to Sweden using borrowed passports.  “Only those who are in Greece. Syrian passports with Swedish residence permit for sale. Only for those who look like passport holders” he allegedly wrote on Facebook though he’d previously flatly denied the allegations.

The deputy head of the IRGC Ali Fadavi described Iran’s missile attacks on US forces as a display of the Islamic Republic’s military capabilities claiming that the Americans “couldn’t do a damn thing” about the strikes. Earlier President Hassan Rouhani said that Iran’s ultimate goal in retaliation against the assassination of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani is the complete removal of US forces from the region. Iran’s supreme leader described the missile strike as a “slap in the face” for the US but said that the attack was not “sufficient” to remove “the corrupting presence of America in the region.” Tehran defended the strikes as a legitimate act of self-defense. US President Donald Trump said that Washington would respond with more sanctions while reserving the right to take further military action against Iran in the future.

304,None,"A new study used a special camera imaging system called CDose custom-built to capture light emissions during the radiotherapy.  During the experiment at the heart of the study the patient reported seeing flashes of light. Follow-up studies were performed on pigs' eyes and allowed researchers to further identify the type and composition of the light confirming that it was indeed the long-suspected culprit Cherenkov radiation.  Cherenkov radiation or Cherenkov emissions occur as a radiation beam passes through the fluid in the eye producing light inside the organ. It is the same phenomenon that causes nuclear reactors to glow blue.

305,None, Shyam Chaurasia from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh has developed a new patent-pending personal security device which makes women’s lips pop almost as loudly as their would-be attackers’ ear drums if test footage of the accessory is anything to go by. The ‘lipstick gun’ is reportedly fitted into an additional space inside a normal lipstick case. When triggered it sets off a loud bang alerting people in the vicinity while also sending a distress signal to the police via the 112 emergency number.  “If a woman is caught in an uncomfortable situation she can simply press the button fitted in the socket. This will trigger a loud explosion-like sound and also send a message to 112.

306,None,In a study published on Thursday scientists show how their potentially paradigm-shifting method known as FLASH radiotherapy has the same effect on tumors as traditional radiation therapy and it gets the job done in a fraction of the time. Boffins from the University of Pennsylvania’s Abramson Cancer Center have taken the first steps in making the revolutionary treatment a reality by detailing how they used proton radiation to generate the dosage needed to theoretically give a cancer patient their entire course of radiotherapy in just one brief sitting. The study also found that the FLASH method was less harmful to healthy tissue because of the shorter exposure time. “This is the first time anyone has published findings that demonstrate the feasibility of using protons rather than electrons to generate FLASH doses with an accelerator currently used for clinical treatments” explained the study’s co-senior author James M Metz. Previous groups of researchers have tried the approach with conventional photons but currently available treatment devices failed to generate the necessary dosage.  The high levels of radiation required to deliver the treatment rapidly saturate radiation detectors so the University of Pennsylvania team had to develop the tools needed to effectively and accurately measure treatment doses.  “We’ve been able to develop specialized systems in the research room to generate FLASH doses demonstrate that we can control the proton beam and perform a large number of experiments to help us understand the implications of FLASH radiation that we simply could not have done with a more traditional research setup” Metz said. The team say they are already beginning to optimize how they would use their techniques in clinical trials. Like this story?

309,None,"The Rok stone created in the ninth century in south central Sweden bears the longest runic inscription known in the world. Scholars have put forward a number of theories about the meaning behind the 700 inscriptions including that the stone may have honored a lost son or served as a way to preserve tribal myths. Its cryptic etchings have now inspired a new interpretation: the runestone was erected by Vikings who prophesized a climate crisis in Scandinavia. The theory has been hatched by researchers hailing from three Swedish universities. The team of academics — which included specialists in the fields of philology archaeology and the history of religion — concluded that the ancient inscription “deals with an anxiety triggered by a son's death and the fear of a new climate crisis similar to the catastrophic one after 536 CE.” Temperatures in Scandinavia plunged in the sixth century destroying crops and causing widespread hunger. The researchers believe that when the runes speak of battles being waged over hundreds of years they’re actually alluding to ""the conflict between light and darkness warmth and cold life and death.” Coincidentally the world’s best-known climate activist Greta Thunberg also hails from Sweden. Even more coincidentally both are known to have sailed in carbon-neutral boats. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

310,None,Iran launched a volley of ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq in the early hours of Wednesday morning bringing the two countries to the brink of war. However no American or Iraqi casualties were sustained and US President Donald Trump responded with economic sanctions instead of military action. Speaking on Iranian state television on Thursday the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) aerospace commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh elaborated on the operation the previos day. Hajizadeh added that expelling American troops from the Middle East would be “appropriate revenge” for the death of IRGC Major General Qassem Soleimani who the US assassinated in a drone strike at Baghdad airport on Friday. He said that the attack would be the start of a series of similar strikes across the region. Trump thanked an “early warning system” for tipping the US military off about the incoming Iranian missiles on Wednesday morning averting casualties at the bases. However the Iraqi government confirmed that it received advance warning of the strikes enabling US troops to take precautionary measures and activate air defense systems. Nevertheless the missiles struck with pinpoint accuracy demonstrating the advancement of Tehran’s military technology in recent years. Earlier in the day  IRGC commander Abdollah Araghi also said that Iran would take “harsher revenge soon” without elaborating further. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei both stated that the Islamic Republic’s ultimate goal is the removal of US troops from the Middle East. Like this story?

312,None,The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) found that offenders from England and Wales are going overseas to “commit extensive abuse of children” including in Asia and Africa. It said travel restrictions are too infrequently placed on offenders to restrict them from taking advantage of children in poor and corrupt countries who may be all the more vulnerable. Chair of the Inquiry Professor Alexis Jay claims the issue is an “urgent problem” the UK cannot hide from. He explained that there were “gaps in our legal system” that were allowing known offenders to target children in developing countries which was “simply not acceptable.” As of March 31 2018 just 0.2 percent of the 58637 registered sex offenders in England and Wales had their overseas travel restricted. The report highlighted high-profile cases including that of singer Gary Glitter (real name Paul Gadd) who sexually abused children in Asia after being convicted of possessing indecent pictures of kids in the UK. Another notorious offender to be singled out was Richard Huckle - known as “Britain's worst paedophile.” He was convicted in 2016 of 71 counts of serious sexual assaults against children while employed as a teacher in Malaysia. Huckle was stabbed to death in his prison cell on October 13 2019. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

313,None,The US attacks on Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) known in Arabic as Hashd al-Shaabi prompted the Iraqi government “to resume negotiations regarding the S-300 deal” Mohammad Ridha chairman of Iraqi parliament’s Security and Defense Committee told Sputnik on Thursday. The US military have launched the air strikes against the PMU units in late December blaming them for an attack that killed an American civilian contractor. The Shia militia force backed by Iran later said it lost 25 fighters. It started a vicious chain of events beginning with fiery anti-American demonstrations near the US Embassy in Baghdad. Though no one from the US diplomatic staff was hurt the Pentagon responded with brute force killing a top Iranian general who they said masterminded the unrest and ratcheting up tensions around Iran.  Now Ridha said he’s unaware of the stage the talks are currently in but mentioned the deal was greenlighted by Iraqi leadership. In his view the prospective purchase won’t sit well with the Americans: “We await US opposition on this issue.” Washington has piled enormous pressure on nations that have bought Russian-made air defense systems or considering buying them. Turkey has been targeted with an array of US penalties for procuring the S-400 while India another prospective operator of the system faces similar ramifications.

It was the fourth day of massive cross-sector protests in the new year. The government is attempting to streamline a fragmented pension system — which currently has 42 different pension schemes — with a new points-based system. Protesters say the new regime would force people to work longer for less reward and would wipe out benefits like early retirement for certain groups of workers.

Therefore Russia is interested in the Arctic remaining a 'zone of peace and cooperation a fresh report by the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS) which was seen by RT read. But with the rivalry of superpowers – the US Russia and China – intensifying in the region it's the stance of Washington that is causing concerns as the Americans believe that Moscow and Beijing must be ""contained and suppressed"" the report said. DIIS which prepares researches for Denmark's government and parliament said that Washington remains a key ally to Copenhagen but acknowledged that it's not always easy to work with the Americans. One of the stark examples of such unpredictability were Donald Trump's attempts to persuade Denmark to sell Greenland to the US last year. But Danish PM Mette Frederiksen firmly rejected the offer stating that the island was not for sale. Greenland is currently home to the northernmost base of the US Air Force Thule Air Base. The facility hosts the US Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) while also handling around 3000 flights every year. The think tank advised Denmark and other northern nations – Iceland Finland and Norway – to carefully monitor not only the regional activities of Russia and China but the US as well the think tank said. It's paramount for Denmark to boost its own potential in the Arctic in order to lower the dependence on the US and NATO DIIS researches said in the report.

317,None,Netflix was ordered to remove ‘The First Temptation of Christ’ a Christmas special by Brazilian comedy group Porta dos Fundos from its platform on Wednesday. Conservative Catholic organization Associacao Centro Dom Bosco de Fe e Cultura had claimed the film “attacked the protection of religious freedom” with its insulting portrayals of the Holy Family.   “The consequences of spreading and exhibiting this ‘artistic production’… are more likely to provoke more serious and irreparable damage than the movie’s suspension” state court judge Benedicto Abicair said. The movie incensed conservative Christians by depicting Jesus as a gay man bringing a boyfriend home to his family: a dimwitted Joseph and a lustful Mary. After its release last month the film was controversially received with petitions to remove it gaining over two million signatures. One particularly dedicated group of detractors even firebombed Porta dos Fundos’ offices in Rio de Janeiro on Christmas Eve filming the attack so there was no question about the cause of the fire (which was quickly contained) and boasting that they had acted against the filmmakers’ “blasphemous bourgeois and anti-patriotic attitude.”  Abicair’s ruling reversed a previous one by a lower court and may still be overturned according to local media. Netflix has the option of appealing to the entire court since the injunction was issued by a single judge.  The decision inspired the defenders of Porta dos Fundos (“backdoor” in Portuguese) to pry into the judge’s background where they discovered he has written articles slamming everything from scantily-clad airline passengers and unhygienic dog owners to ‘disrespectful’ clothing worn by lawyers.

Krugman was immediately savaged for what commenters saw as an act of pre-emptive ass-covering. “Good one @paulkrugman” one wrote. “I’m sure the @FBI will totally buy it.” As Krugman was dog-piled online he took the matter not to law enforcement but to his employers at the New York Times. After all where else would a smeared liberal journalist run to than into the protective arms of the liberal media. A short while later and evidently after a chat with his bosses Krugman tweeted “Times thinks it may have been a scam. Anyway will have more security in future.” So did Krugman a Nobel-prize-winning economist out himself as a pedophile for the whole world to see? Highly unlikely. Instead the 66-year-old writer likely fell for a ‘spearphishing’ scam in which pop-up ads or emails warn gullible computer users that child porn has been found on their PC usually accompanied with a request to hand over money to make the problem go away. Looking back through Krugman’s twitter feed it seems he’s not the most computer literate writer at the Times. Krugman has a history of falling for internet scams whether they’re attampts to hack his Facebook account or sign him up for sites offering “live sex cams.” He also has a history of making terrible predictions. In 1998 Krugman wrote that “the growth of the internet will slow drastically” and “by 2005 or so it will become clear that the internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.” He also predicted in 2016 that Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election would bring about “a global recession with no end in sight.” Neither have come true yet based on recent events the internet continues to regularly vex and frustrate Krugman.

320,None,"Despite its passage the bill lacks the teeth to actually curb Trump’s warmaking powers should he decide to take military action against Iran. As a ‘Concurrent Resolution’ it does not need Trump’s signature will not go on to the Republican-controlled Senate for approval and will not become law. Instead it simply expresses the position of the House. The bill was sponsored by former CIA analyst and Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin (Michigan) and calls on Trump to ""to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or against Iran"" unless Congress formally declares war on the Islamic Republic. The bill was written in the aftermath of the American assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani who was killed at Baghdad airport on Friday in a drone strike. Iran responded by launching a volley of ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq used by American troops. The attacks killed nobody with Baghdad reportedly forewarned and Trump declined to respond with force opting to place further economic sanctions on Iran instead. Despite the apparent cooldown House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called a vote on the bill regardless stating on Wednesday that “America and the world cannot afford war.” The power to declare war is held exclusively by Congress under The War Powers Resolution of 1973. Without Congressional authorization the President cannot commit troops to any foreign conflict for more than 60 days. However the resolution was allegedly violated by Bill Clinton when he ordered the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. Since 2001 the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) has allowed successive administrations to wage war against anyone they deemed “planned authorized committed or aided” the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Since its passing the act has been invoked 41 times to allow US military action in 19 countries including Afghanistan Iraq Syria Somalia and Yemen. However the AUMF may soon be scrapped too. Pelosi announced on Wednesday that the House may soon consider legislation to repeal and replace the act. In the hours leading up to Thursday’s vote Trump asked House Republicans to “vote against Crazy Nancy Pelosi’s War Powers Resolution” calling the resolution “Just another Democrat fraud” and “Presidential Harassment.” Think your friends would be interested?

Eyewitnesses have described seeing the aircraft engulfed in flames in the sky before it came down. Johnson has said that there needs to be “a full credible and transparent investigation into what happened” according to his spokesman. There is a body of information indicating the flight was shot down by an Iranian missile Johnson claimed later on Thursday. The remarks come after Oleksiy Danilov secretary of Ukraine’s Security Council told Ukrainian media that officials were working on a number of theories regarding the crash including that of a missile strike “as information has surfaced on the internet about elements of a missile being found near the site of the crash.”  Ukraine had initially suggested that the crash was due to an engine fire or another technical issue but later retracted the statement.

325,None,Scientifically it is impossible that a missile hit the Ukrainian plane and such rumours are illogical Ali Abedzadeh head of Iran's of Civil Aviation Organization said on Thursday according to the news agency ISNA. Citing anonymous Pentagon and intelligence officials US media have reported that the Boeing 737 was “highly likely” brought down by Iranian air defenses. The Ukrainian International Airlines flight 752 crashed within minutes of departing Tehran just hours after the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps fired two volleys of missiles at US targets inside Iraq as reprisal for last week’s assassination of General Qassem Soleimani. Even US President Donald Trump seemed to speculate about a missile in a speech on Thursday though he didn't blame the Iranian military but said that “somebody could have made a mistake.” Iranian civil aviation authorities considered the possibility that the plane was shot down but dismissed it because the plane attempted to return to the airport. Ukrainian officials cited a photo of missile debris that “was published on the internet” as possible evidence of an attack but Iranian authorities say the photos do not match physical evidence. “No parts of a missile were found at the scene of the crash” civil aviation inspector Hassan Rezaeifar told the IRNA news agency describing the missile scenario as “off the table.” A preliminary Iranian report suggested that the plane caught fire and tried to turn around before crashing.

327,None,"The social media behemoth has announced that it will continue to allow political ads to target users based on specific attributes (“microtargeting”) and exempt these ads from fact-checking two controversial practices that have been the subject of much pearl-clutching as the 2020 US presidential election approaches. While Facebook had briefly thought of limiting microtargeting it explained in a blog post on Thursday that talking with political campaigns NGOs and other groups that use the technique had convinced the company that it was necessary. Instead Facebook has opted for “expanded transparency” allowing users to learn about what ads are targeting them and why. A feature allowing the user to see fewer political ads will be introduced in the summer Facebook promised. Critics exploded. The Federal Election Commission’s Ellen Weintraub accused Facebook of “hurting democracy” and placing its profit margins above “protect[ing] the democracies that have nurtured its existence.” “These so-called ’transparency’ solutions are neither transparent nor solutions” she sniffed hinting that the platform’s intransigence might convince Congress to take away the Section 230 exemptions that allow it to avoid liability for content users post. Microtargeting Weintraub warned in the Washington Post recently “may be undermining the united character of our United States.” Others suggested Facebook was literally putting users’ lives at risk by allowing politicians to pay for the ability to lie to their constituents. Actor Sacha Baron Cohen who made waves when he declared last month that Adolf Hitler would have used Facebook to spread negative information about Jews called the move “outrageous” and slammed CEO Mark Zuckerberg for helping “the demagogues of the world.” The company - already blamed by some for the outcome of the 2016 election - was “actively destroying election integrity intentionally” all for the sake of its bottom line its detractors said. But not even Facebook believes voters should rely on the platform in place of their own critical thinking certainly not for something as important as choosing their leaders - at least so says Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth. “If we limit what information people have access to and what they can say then we have no democracy at all” he mused in a memo to Zuckerberg last month taking a surprisingly moral stance on informational coercion. Zuckerberg himself has said he does not want his platform to be viewed as an “arbiter of truth” with regard to political statements. Given that Facebook partnered with NATO-backed pro-war think tank Atlantic Council in 2018 and since then has been deplatforming dissident voices at a rapid clip many on mere suspicion of being linked to foreign ""manipulators"" the platform's users would be wise to take his words to heart.  Facebook’s laissez-faire approach to truth in advertising diverges wildly from the platform’s usual infantilization of its users whom it tends to treat more like human-shaped data-teats to be milked mercilessly than like intellectually curious critical thinkers. Yet this flicker of humanity in the soul of a corporation notorious for censoring “wrongthink” and promoting establishment-friendly content not the platform’s trading in private user data with third parties without consent or the frequent “breaches” that spill users’ information into the dark corners of the internet — is what the movers and shakers of American politics object to. For all that American politicians pay lip service to “media literacy” — House Democrats introduced a bill to promote critical thinking skills just a few months ago ostensibly to give citizens the tools to recognize disinformation — the explosive reaction to Facebook’s ad policy has shown it is more concerned with controlling the narrative than with encouraging voters to think for themselves. When Mark Zuckerberg is a society’s champion of free speech that society is in deep trouble. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

328,None,Reports of police and emergency services dealing with an “active shooter” situation on Hawthorne Street appeared around 1:30 pm local time on Thursday. Police urged everyone to stay clear of the area.  Helicopter footage from local news media shows multiple officers converging on the neighborhood in Frankford a northeastern section of Philadelphia. The man opened fire on officers who were trying to serve him with a warrant for violating his parole Deputy Commissioner Robin Wimberly told reporters. Six officers responded to the alert as the suspect barricaded himself inside the home. A SWAT team stormed the premises shortly after 3pm and exchanged gunfire with the man who was fatally shot. The Warren G. Harding Middle School and Frankford High School were placed on “lock-in” due to the active shooter situation. Think your friends would be interested?

329,None,Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a truce in Libya during their meeting on Wednesday in Istanbul after Turkey sent troops and equipment to Tripoli in support of the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA).  Haftar’s LNA controls most of Libya however and has been advancing on Tripoli in recent days. He rejected the idea of a ceasefire on Thursday after returning from Rome where Italy tried without success to mediate a deal between the LNA and GNA head Fayez al-Sarraj. The general also declared jihad against Turkey last week after the parliament in Ankara voted to approve the troop deployment. The UN-backed government is only “hanging on in a coastal strip of the country” and has “very little control” over Libya political analyst Chris Bambery told RT. It is unlikely Haftar would agree to back down just when the LNA appears to be nearing victory he said. Italy which ruled Libya as a colonial power from 1911 into the 1940s tried to get Haftar and al-Sarraj to negotiate in Rome but the GNA leader canceled his trip after finding out the LNA general was also invited. Al-Sarraj went to Brussels instead for talks with EU officials which he called “very productive.” Once the most prosperous country in Africa Libya collapsed into chaos and civil war after a US-led NATO intervention in 2011 overthrew the government of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. Haftar’s LNA is one of the factions that emerged from the chaos with the backing of neighboring Egypt. Think your friends would be interested?

330,None,Video from outside the deceased financier’s cell on the day he was found semi-conscious on the floor with marks on his neck believed to have attempted suicide has been permanently deleted by Metropolitan Correctional Center according to a court filing. The jail allegedly saved video from the wrong tier of the facility. A backup system that should have retained the deleted footage stopped functioning in August and the video no longer exists there either due to “technical errors” prosecutors claimed. It is the latest in a long series of “mistakes” and anomalies surrounding the convicted sex offender’s death. The footage had a complicated journey before its final meeting with oblivion if media reports are to be believed. Prosecutors claimed to have “found” the video on December 19 a day after a prosecutor said it had gone missing during a hearing. When it was found it was said to have been properly preserved by MCC staff. The footage had been requested by attorneys for Epstein’s former cellmate a burly ex-cop named Nicholas Tartaglione accused of killing four people in a drug deal gone bad and burying them in his backyard.  They asked to see the tape in the hope of obtaining a more lenient sentence for Tartaglione after he claimed he had helped save Epstein’s life - only to be stonewalled for nearly five months.  Epstein allegedly attempted suicide on July 23 only to be saved by Tartaglione. Just two days later Tartaglione’s attorneys asked to see the surveillance footage only to be “told that it was not retained” one lawyer recalled to CNBC. It’s not clear why this went unremarked-upon for five months or where the footage was ultimately found.  Crucially it appears the footage was still in limbo when Epstein was found dead on the morning of August 10. His death was ruled a suicide though a celebrity pathologist hired by his family claimed his body showed evidence of homicidal strangulation and witnesses heard “shrieking and yelling” coming from his cell that morning. Epstein’s death - the first 'suicide' inside the MCC in decades - remains shrouded in mystery. Two guards have been charged with negligence for failing to check on their infamous prisoner for hours and surveillance video from that day was deemed “unusable.” Revelations that Epstein had compromising material on many of his powerful friends gave rise to numerous alternate theories about his death.

331,None,Ali Abedzadeh told CNN that while Iran has the capacity to decode the black boxes from the Boeing passenger jet it might still need extra help because they were badly damaged. “Generally speaking Iran has the potential and know-how to decode the black box. Everybody knows that” he said adding that Iranian and Ukrainian experts would begin decoding the data on Friday. However “if the available equipment is not enough to get the content” Abedzadeh explained Tehran will send the boxes to experts “from France or Canada.” “Then whatever is the result will be published and publicized to the world” he said. Iran has also requested Boeing send a representative to join the investigation in Tehran. Iran said on Wednesday it wouldn’t hand the black boxes over to the US preferring to do its own investigation. US media reports on Thursday cited anonymous Pentagon and intelligence officials claiming that Iran had itself mistakenly shot down the plane which had just taken off from Tehran’s busy Imam Khomeini airport. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau quickly followed the US lead on Thursday saying that intelligence pointed to Iran being responsible for the “unintentional” shooting down of the plane.

332,None,“We have intelligence from multiple sources” Trudeau said on Thursday. “The intelligence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile. This may well have been unintentional.” Trudeau also said it was “too soon to be apportioning blame” for the crash or “drawing any conclusions” however. His comments echo those of US President Donald Trump who said earlier in the day he had “suspicions” that “somebody could have made a mistake” without elaborating. US media outlets have been citing anonymous officials as saying that the Boeing 737 was “highly likely” brought down by Iranian air defenses early on Wednesday. Iranian civil aviation authorities however have ruled out the theory saying no missile debris was found at the crash site. “Scientifically it is impossible that a missile hit the Ukrainian plane and such rumours are illogical” Ali Abedzadeh head of Iran's of Civil Aviation Organization said on Thursday was quoted by the news agency ISNA. UIA flight 752 crashed within minutes of departing Tehran just hours after the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps fired two volleys of missiles at US targets inside Iraq as reprisal for last week’s assassination of General Qassem Soleimani.

334,None,The police force outside the presidential administration building failed to contain the angry crowd with people smashing doors and windows to make it inside. Footage from the president’s HQ showed the protesters roaming the offices overturning furniture and throwing state papers around. A large crowd remained camped outside the building as the night descended on the Abkhazian capital. The protest leaders urged the people not to disperse until their goal is achieved. The unrest erupted on the day when the High Court was considering the complaint by the opposition who insists that the president maintained his post illegally during the election in August. Alkhas Kvitsinia who lost to Khajimba by less than 2 percent in the second round argues that a new vote is needed as none of the candidates was able to pass the 50 percent threshold. Later on Thursday the Abkhazian MPs held a vote and decided to ask Khajimba to step down and schedule a new election in order to defuse the tensions.

335,None,"All these reports are a psychological warfare against Iran” government spokesman Ali Rabiei said on Thursday. “All those countries whose citizens were aboard the plane can send representatives and we urge Boeing to send its representative to join the process of investigating the black box.” Foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi has meanwhile called on Canadian PM Justin Trudeau to share the intelligence he has claimed to have from “multiple sources” that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile. Trudeau’s claim follows statements from UK PM Boris Johnson that his government is “urgently looking into” reports that the plane was shot down by a missile and speculation from US President Donald Trump that he had “suspicions” that “somebody could have made a mistake.” While Trump did not explicitly accuse Tehran of shooting down the plane anonymous US officials have told media that it was “highly likely” Iranian air defenses brought it down. The Pentagon has not commented in an official capacity. Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran on its way to Kiev early Wednesday morning killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board. Ukraine has sent investigators to Tehran and an inquiry is underway into what caused the crash. Iran has welcomed all countries who lost citizens in the crash as well as Boeing representatives to take part in the investigation and even stated it might enlist the help of French or Canadian experts to decode the data in the black boxes recovered from the wreckage with the results being “published and publicized to the world.” However it has flatly refused to hand the boxes over to the US slamming the “illogical” rumors implicating Tehran in the wreck.

While it’s unclear when the image scans started Apple’s chief privacy officer Jane Horvath confirmed at an event in Las Vegas this week that the company is now “utilizing some technologies to help screen for child sexual abuse material.” Apple initially suggested it might inspect images for abuse material last year – and only this week added a disclaimer to its website acknowledging the practice – but Horvath’s remarks come as the first confirmation the company has gone ahead with the scans. A number of tech giants including Facebook Twitter and Google already employ an image-scanning tool known as PhotoDNA which cross-checks photos with a database of known abuse images. It is unknown whether Apple’s scanning tool uses similar technology. The move sent off alarms for critics some disputing Apple’s sincerity in its avowed desire to crack down on crime as well as whether the photo scans will further erode the privacy of consumers especially given the scant detail the company has so far offered about the screening process. “Of course everyone is for stopping child abuse and that’s not the issue here. It’s that I’m simply not buying it” journalist and political commentator Chadwick Moore told RT. “I don't believe that Apple really cares about fighting crime.” Moore said the company has been excessively vague about the scans noting “all it says is that they can scan all your images flip through all your data and look for potentially illegal activity including child pornography.” Tech expert and privacy advocate Bill Mew said the critics are wrong however arguing that the new measure may be less intrusive than it appears given Apple’s technological capabilities. “The technology that is in use is really clever” Mew told RT. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that Apple can actually see your photos” as the company can “sift through these images and test them against a set of known ‘fingerprints’ ... without actually de-encrypting the images themselves.” While Apple has gone to bat for data privacy in the past – on several occasions tussling with law enforcement agencies seeking access to one of the company’s devices – its track record on the question in somewhat mixed. In August it was revealed that company contractors were granted access to customers’ private conversations through Apple’s AI assistant program Siri in an effort to “grade” its performance. Several other tech giants have come under fire for similar intrusions with both Google and Amazon’s home assistant devices also found to surreptitiously record users. Like this story?

In its release of the redacted communications on Thursday following an internal probe Boeing acknowledged some of the messages were “completely unacceptable” and contained “provocative language.” In one missive sent in 2017 an employee castigated the 737 MAX – which was grounded globally last March after a series of fatal crashes – slamming both its designers and ‘supervisors’ apparently referring to federal regulators. The employee has not been named and it is not clear what problems he had identified with the MAX at the time. Another damning message sent in 2018 shows an employee grappling with ethical concerns telling a colleague “I still haven’t been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year” another apparent reference to the company’s interactions with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In addition to the faulty flight control system thought to have caused the two MAX crashes the aircraft’s flight simulators also came under fire by employees in the internal messages. “Would you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn’t” one employee asked a coworker who simply replied: “No.” In a statement issued along with the documents Boeing apologized “to the FAA Congress our airline customers and to the flying public” for the “content of these communications” adding it would pursue “disciplinary or other personnel action once the necessary reviews are completed.” An FAA spokesman however noted the documents do not reveal any new safety risks with the 737 MAX’s simulators despite the potentially incriminating communiques indicating employees concealed problems from the agency.

On the heels of a speech from Pakistan’s UN envoy Munir Akram on Thursday – who insisted on New Delhi’s “aggressive intent” toward his country and that India had been “false and duplicitous” in claiming Kashmir had returned to a state of normalcy – the Indian envoy shot back with surprising diction. “One delegation that epitomizes the dark arts has yet again displayed its wares by peddling falsehoods earlier today. These we dismiss with disdain” replied Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin. At the Security Council Akram also alleged India had carried out some 3000 ceasefire violations in the disputed Kashmir region where Pakistan also maintains territorial claims and called on the council to “to act decisively to prevent a disastrous war between Pakistan and India.” Like this story?

The country's authorities are considering an update to recently adopted regulations on drones which are due to take effect this month the Indian Express reported on Friday citing two high-ranking government sources. There is a realization of the need to up the guard [on who gets licenses]… there will be a step back on that"" a source said explaining that the existing drone policy requires ""careful reassessment given the new risks."" According to the report the authorities were alarmed by the drone attack on two Saudi oil refineries in September which temporarily crippled the country's oil production and last week's US drone strike that killed several senior Iranian and Iraqi officials including Major General Soleimani the head of Iran's elite Quds Force. It is believed that the strike on Soleimani was carried out by an MQ-9 Reaper spy and combat UAV. Soleimani's death sparked a new flare-up between Iran and the US. Tehran retaliated in response to the assassination by launching missiles at military bases that house US troops in Iraq. New Delhi has been taking steps to create a comprehensive drone policy which classifies UAVs and sets up a nationwide database of drone owners. Under the new rules all UAV operators must register with the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

336,None,"The story will unfold predominantly in Russian on Facebook YouTube VK Twitter and Instagram starting January 13 2020 and will run until May 9 – the day Russia celebrates Victory over Nazism.  The project’s first release a ‘smart’ font available for free download became an essential part of the project’s design identity.This font called ‘May’ is based on inscriptions Soviet soldiers left on the walls of the Reichstag in Berlin in spring 1945. Dutch company Animography animated ‘May’ for #VictoryPages. “For me the most interesting aspect of the May typeface is the sentiment it carries. When you type you are borrowing a piece someone else’s personality. Their handwriting. It is imbued with their emotion from that specific day.  It makes you think twice about the words you type because you want to respect that piece of history. No other typeface has that quality"" the company's founder Jeroen Krielaars says. The font is now available for free download on the #VictoryPages project’s webpage. Behind each font character there is a real letter handwritten by soldiers 75 years ago. These inscriptions are the voices words and memories of the victors. With its handwritten characters and symbols calligraphic and rough neatly styled and expressively sharp the font creates a visual link between the past and the present between the heroes of the Victory and their descendants.  “The font of Victory ‘May’ is a kind of living graphic monument to veterans. But we want to believe that these letters that came to life will also serve as a reminder of the price of victory” the project’s Creative Producer Kirill Karnovich-Valua explained. “We managed to put together a unique creative team of young artists designers illustrators composers and directors. Digital art is a modern and universal language that the youth speaks. Therefore we thought that on the 75th anniversary of the end of one of the worst wars it was important that we should try talk about the war’s legacy in the language of modern media.” Karnovich-Valua went on to say. The font was created by Contrast Foundry. Each letter has several alternate forms and sits in line somewhat unevenly creating a handwritten effect similar to the style of inscriptions on walls. A larger font size displays rich texture similar to something written on a rough surface while smaller lettering hardly shows any texture at all making it easier to read – this is possible due to a special algorithm that modifies the outline of the letters. The project comes from the team behind #1917LIVE and #Romanovs100 and will be rolled out primarily in Russian from January to May 2020. On Twitter #VictoryPages will relive the last months of the war in real time Instagram Stories will feature quotes from thousands of actual letters exchanged between the war front and home with illustrations by RANEPA students and a score from Maxim Makarychev (On-The-Go Sirotkin). A YouTube documentary series will tell the stories of soldiers and officers who made it to Berlin in 1945 and young graphic designers and digital artists will present their interpretation of the legacy of the Great Patriotic War using Facebook while producer Anna Fedorova will team up with musician Maxim Makarychev to create a series of Podcasts for VK.

338,None,The trio of galaxies named EGS77 dates back to when the universe was just 680 million years old. In the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang the universe was a thick cloudy soup dense with hydrogen atoms and almost entirely bereft of light.  After 500 million years the epoch of deionization began in which ever-expanding galaxies began to burn away the fog splitting the hydrogen atoms into bubbles of plasma thus allowing light to travel across the cosmos. Think of ice melting on top of a lake in the spring as NASA so eloquently put it. This trio located some 13 billion light-years away is just now leaving the darkness encased by three overlapping bubbles of cosmic plasma which are only now deionizing their corner of the universe (clearing away the fog) and letting the light in (and out) thus ending the cosmic dark age.  “EGS77 is the first galaxy group caught in the act of clearing out this cosmic fog” study co-author James Rhoads of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center said. Astronomers think they’ve spotted these plasma bubbles expanding for the first time reshaping the universe around them and giving us an albeit distant glance into the cosmic past showcasing some of the earliest light ever observed.   “EGS77 has formed a large bubble that allows its light to travel to Earth” study co-author Vithal Tilvi a researcher at Arizona State University explained. “Eventually bubbles like these grew around all galaxies and filled intergalactic space reionizing the universe and clearing the way for light to travel across the cosmos.” Like this story?

347,None,Robinson –real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon– appeared on Ross Kemp’s ITV series ‘Welcome to HMP Belmarsh’ on Thursday night. The documentary gives viewers an insight into one of Britain’s most dangerous prisons where Robinson was an inmate for nine weeks last year before being released in September.  During one moment Kemp’s questions reduced Robinson to tears as he struggled to convey how being in solitary confinement had affected him.  Asked how he was feeling Robinson fought back tears responding: “I’d say that my thing is ‘cause I know I’m going home to my kids and you just wanna be normal.” The 37-year-old is then seen walking away from the camera before adding: “Yeah that’s embarrassing.” However the controversial figure does manage to open up more about life inside Belmarsh insisting: “I know what 10 weeks of solitary confinement does.” The claim was ruthlessly slapped down by Kemp. Robinson was found guilty of contempt over his filming of criminal defendants outside a court and broadcasting the footage online. He was originally sentenced to nine months but was told in July 2019 that he would only serve 10 weeks in prison due to time already served for the same offense. Fellow Belmarsh prisoner Liridon Saliuka 29 was found dead in his cell on January 2 following a dispute over whether he should have been classified as disabled. He was the third inmate to have died in the jail – which is also where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is being held – in less than a year. A fellow inmate was found dead in the notorious London facility in November. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

348,None,"The OSCE's media freedom chief Harlem Desir ""is closely following the situation of Sputnik Estonia"" the organization's secretary-general Thomas Greminger confirmed to RT in a statement. Greminger said that ""concerns"" about media freedom have been conveyed to Estonia and Desir had asked local authorities to provide more information about the case. On Thursday tensions surrounding Sputnik Estonia were officially listed among the 'media freedom alerts' on the Council of Europe's website. The case was registered under the 'other acts having chilling effects on media freedom' category. Estonian police have been sending letters to journalists working for Sputnik's bureau in the nation's capital Tallinn in which they threatened them with ""criminal liability"" unless they cut all work ties with Russian state-owned media agency Rossiya Segodnya Sputnik's parent company. The officials insisted that this was completely lawful since the head of Rossiya Segodnya veteran journalist and media producer Dmitry Kiselyov has been sanctioned by the EU since Crimea voted to leave Ukraine and rejoin Russia. Rossiya Segodnya slammed the actions of Estonian police as a ""flagrant violation of the freedom of speech"" and said that Sputnik's employees in Estonia had been pressured into terminating their employment contracts with the agency. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ) as well as Russian officials voiced their support for Sputnik stressing that the harassment of reporters is unacceptable.

349,None,The bizarre incident with the aircraft operated by Russian carrier Nordwind occurred on Friday afternoon. The pilots requested an emergency landing over smoke that began to appear in the cabin according to media reports. The landing turned out to be rough as the plane apparently hit the tarmac with its front way too hard. Photos from the scene show its airframe badly bent around the front landing gear — which penetrated the plane’s structure entering the cabin a little. Both of the gear’s tires have been ruptured during the landing yet the strut itself was able to survive the hit and remained standing. The incident has been acknowledged by Russia’s Consulate General in Antalya. The plane was not carrying passengers and nobody was injured among the crew the diplomatic mission said.

350,None,An international research team has discovered unexpectedly large amounts of water vapor accumulating at an altitude of 80km up in the Martian atmosphere.  The scientists gathered the data thanks to the Trace Gas Orbiter probe from the ExoMars mission which is financed by the Russian space agency Roscosmos and the European Space Agency. Previous studies had already established that water vapor escapes the Martian atmosphere via violent dust storms. The gigantic dust tornadoes act as a kind of space elevator transporting the H2O far enough up that sunlight breaks up the molecules into their constituent parts forming a vast cloud of hydrogen in the process. However boffins have now found pockets in the atmosphere containing 10 to 100 times more water vapor than should theoretically be possible given the temperature in a phenomenon known as “supersaturation.”  The extraordinary levels of supersaturation “are observed nowhere on any other body of the solar system” Franck Montmessin a planetary scientist at the University of Paris-Saclay and the study’s co-lead author explained.   While most of the Red Planet's remaining water is now trapped in the polar ice caps given the planet’s relatively weak gravity (40 percent as strong as Earth's) the loss of water vapor at such an unprecedented rate throws a spanner in the works of any future plans for colonization or even terraforming until the mystery can be solved once and for all.

351,None,The team wanted to investigate if increasing the number of stem cells in the brain would help in recovering cognitive functions like learning and memory that had worsened or had been lost entirely during the aging process.  To do so researchers from TU Dresden’s Center for Regenerative Therapies used a method to stimulate and increase the number of neural stem cells located in the brains of mice and thus increase the number of neurons they generate.  Much to their surprise the newly generated neurons survived and formed new contacts in neighboring brain cells. To put these freshly minted neurons to the test the boffins then tested the navigational abilities of the test subject mice.  Mice and humans develop strategies for navigation in much the same way: when both species are young our brains build and remember cognitive maps of an environment. As we age however this ability fades significantly. Older mammalian brains must instead learn the list of detailed navigational steps to reach a target destination within an environment with little to no access to the overall cognitive map. This means that should the starting point change in the same environment it would take far longer to navigate to the end destination.  By stimulating the neural stem cells in their brains the old mice in the study successfully recovered their cognitive mapping ability and remembered the layout of a given environment for far longer effectively reversing the effects of the aging process on this particular skill.  “Age-related impairments can be rescued by hijacking the endogenous neurogenic potential of the brain thus rejuvenating its function” explained Professor Federico Calegari senior author of the study. The researchers took it one step further and carried out the same neural stem cell stimulation treatment on the brains of young mice and found that cognitive impairments were delayed and memory was preserved for longer over the course of their lives.  A part of the brain known as the hippocampus is crucial for remembering places and events but this degrades over time and as a result older brains use other structures that are more closely associated with habit-forming. The researchers now believe they can delay this switch and thus improve overall cognition throughout an animal’s lifespan though this treatment is of course some time away from human trials.  Think your friends would be interested?

354,None,The office of the Prosecutor General in Kiev has urged that everyone “refrain from speculations” concerning the plane crash. The prosecutors stopped short of mentioning anyone by name but the statement was likely a rebuke of Yuriy Lutsenko who despite lacking a law degree had served as the nation’s prosecutor-general for three years until he was dismissed last August. Lutsenko had earlier accused the prosecution of “burying its head in the sand” by treating the plane crash as an air traffic rules violation case rather than a terrorist act. Kiev-bound Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran airport on Wednesday killing all 176 people on board. The tragedy occurred on the same day as Iran fired a volley of ballistic missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house US troops. The action was a response to the US drone strike that killed top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani along with several other Iranian and Iraqi officials at Baghdad Airport. This close sequence of events immediately sparked a flurry of speculation in the media as to whether Iran’s army could have shot the airliner by mistake. US president Donald Trump Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and their British counterpart Boris Johnson have all suggested that that could have been the case. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky asked foreign partners to share their data which could help the investigation. The Prosecutor General’s office confirmed on Friday that it had requested assistance from foreign governments. Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko who is meeting his American counterpart Mike Pompeo on Friday tweeted that US diplomats have provided Ukraine with “important data that will be examined by our experts.” Iran firmly denies the airliner was downed by a missile and says that it likely crashed due to some equipment failure or other issues on board.

The US ""seeks to emulate the war crimes of Daesh menacing the cultural heritage of the millennia-old civilization of Iran"" he said. His remarks were delivered by Iran's UN Ambassador Majid Takht-Ravanchi after Washington refused to issue a visa for Zarif to attend the meeting himself — a violation of its obligations as the host of the UN headquarters. In a tweet last Saturday Trump said the US had identified 52 sites to attack if Tehran responded to the killing of Soleimani. Some of the sites on the list he said are “very important” to “Iranian culture.” The threat sparked international outrage and a statement from UNESCO which warned the US that it is party to treaties which prohibit the targeting of cultural sites during times of armed conflict. ISIS militants destroyed numerous mosques churches temples and monuments on their rampage across Iraq and Syria including parts of the ancient ruins at Palmyra. In the speech Zarif also condemned the US killing of Soleimani as a ""dastardly targeted assassination"" and said that Iran's response in targeting US military bases in Iraq was ""measured and proportionate.""

358,None,UK police say Gemma Watts may have assaulted up to 50 school girls while posing as a 16-year-old school boy named ‘Jake Watton.’ Officers said many of her victims may only realise they had been duped by the predator now that she has been jailed and her case widely publicised. The 21-year-old groomed her victims via Snapchat Instagram Whatsapp and other social media services. She tied her hair up and wore a baseball cap baggy trousers and a hoodie to fool the children.  Watts began what the judge described as her “predatory behavior” when she was 19 and targeted a number of 13 to 16 year olds. She convinced the children to swap intimate photos sometimes speaking with them over the phone before travelling by train to meet in person. She reportedly even met some of the girls’ parents while in character as ‘Jake.’ One of the victims said that her ‘heart exploded’ in an impact statement which was read aloud to Winchester Crown Court. “My world stopped I actually stopped breathing… I loved him so much” the victim wrote. Watts previously pleaded guilty to seven charges of sexual assault and grooming of four girls between the ages of 14 and 15. However she continued to groom young females whilst on police bail after her initial arrest and partial confession and was later placed under surveillance to prevent her from offending again while investigations were ongoing. “The level of manipulation and deceit used by Watts to snare her victims in this case was truly shocking” Police Constable Nicola Benson from Hampshire Constabulary said.  “Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation online with increased use of social media apps and there is a real risk that any contact with a stranger online can lead to a child meeting an offender in person” she added. On Friday Watts was sentenced to eight years in prison was placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life and was made subject to a life-long Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

Ortagus acknowledged that there does “need to be a conversation” between US and Iraqi officials “not just regarding security but about our financial economic and diplomatic partnership.” Earlier Friday Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi had asked US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to send a delegation to begin preparations for a troop pullout. The Iraqi parliament last week passed a non-binding resolution asking the government to expel foreign troops and to cancel the ongoing request for military assistance from the US-led coalition.  There are currently 5200 US troops stationed at bases across Iraq who were invited by the Iraqi government in 2014 to help combat ISIS militants in the region. The relationship between Washington and Baghdad has soured in recent months however as tensions in the region flared. The mood got even more tense after a US drone strike in Baghdad killed a commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force. Iraq’s parliamentary resolution was dismissed by US President Donald Trump who threatened the country with ""very big sanctions"" and said the US would not leave until Iraq paid Washington back for an expensive air base it had built there. Pompeo has also disregarded the will of the Iraqi parliament saying he was ""confident"" that the Iraqi people want US troops to remain. Saad Al-Muttalibi a member of the Baghdad Security Committee told RT last week that it was ""very important"" for the US to withdraw its troops from Iraq because Iraqis “don't want to be drawn into a war between Iran and America on Iraqi soil.” Think your friends would be interested?

363,None,“We have no reason to not believe the reports we have seen from different NATO allies…that the plane may have been downed by Iranian air defense systems” Stoltenberg told reporters on Friday. He called for Iran to “participate and contribute to a transparent and thorough investigation.” Iran has welcomed countries that lost citizens in the crash of Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 which killed all 176 people on board to participate in the investigation. It has suggested it will enlist the help of France or Canada in decoding the data from the black boxes retrieved from the wreckage but refuses to hand them over to the US. The US-led narrative that Iran shot down the plane by “mistake” has gradually eclipsed other explanations in the media even from outlets that had previously aired competing narratives though no evidence has emerged to support the hypothesis. US President Donald Trump hinted on Thursday that “somebody could have made a mistake” and anonymous US officials went further to claim it was “highly likely” Iran had shot it down. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau piled on with his own claims that multiple pieces of intelligence supported the narrative though he admitted it was too early to be “drawing any conclusions.” Iran has called the claims “psychological warfare” and asked the US and its allies to produce evidence to support the rapidly-congealing narrative. Ukrainian prosecutors have meanwhile called for an end to “speculations” and the “shameless self-promotion” of certain politicians that are trying to capitalize on the narrative. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed to foreign partners to share the evidence mentioned in the public claims. The plane crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini Airport en route to Kiev not long after Iran had fired missiles at two US bases in Iraq. Aside from temporal proximity however no evidence has yet emerged implicating Iran in the flight’s demise. Like this story?

Mike Pompeo in turn described the newly-sanctioned officials as members of Iran’s “inner security apparatus.” Among those sanctioned are the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council and the deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian armed forces. A leader of a paramilitary group within the Revolutionary Guard’s Corps that acts as law enforcement and social services provider in Iran was also slapped with restrictions. Washington also subjected 17 major Iranian metal manufacturers and mining companies to sanctions and imposed restrictions against several China- and Seychelles-based enterprises which it described as major ""purchasers and transporters"" of Iranian steel as well as providers of critical materials for the relevant Iranian industries. The Secretary of State also said that he has ""no doubt"" Iran had ""full intention"" to kill Americans in its latest missile strike on Iraqi bases housing the US troops. He also added that the US believes that Iran was ""likely"" to jave shot down the Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed after taking off from Tehran airport as well. Pompeo went on to call Trump's response to Tehran's actions ""appropriate"" adding that the US ""does not want war."" Instead he said Washington would ""continue its strategic effort"" to force Iran to abandon what he called a ""40-year-long"" campaign to ""terrorize the world."" The announcement comes a day after President Donald Trump promised more sanctions against Iran following the missile attack targeting the US troops in Iraq. The newly announced restrictions would come in addition to a thousand pieces of earlier constraints Washington relentlessly imposed against Tehran ever since Trump unilaterally left the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018.

'Joker' star Phoenix as well as Martin Sheen Susan Sarandon and Fonda — who has been arrested multiple times while protesting — attended and spoke at the rally.  During brief remarks in front of the crowd Phoenix preached about the meat and dairy industries being the “third leading cause of climate change.” The famous vegan encouraged people to make better choices about what they consume. He ended his remarks by admitting he had flown on an airplane to the protest.  The celebs also joined the march and held placards. Various other speakers railed against the “patriarchy” and “colonialism” and preached: “We are the woke.”  Phoenix previously earned criticism for bragging about wearing one tuxedo to every awards ceremony most of which he is attending for recognition of his performance in ‘Joker.’ The activism did not earn much praise. “My husband and his co-workers wear the same firefighter outfit when they go into burning buildings to try to save people. But yeah good for you Joaquin” one Twitter user wrote. The thought was retweeted by former Fox News host Megyn Kelly. “How out of touch are these ppl?? Oh the sacrifice! Just ONE tuxedo!

She was often mocked for what many saw as her eccentric ideas including advocating the formation of a US ‘Department of Peace.’ Williamson raised some eyebrows during a July debate when she said US President Donald Trump had harnessed the “dark psychic force of collectivized hatred.” During her campaign she also released plans on “racial reconciliation and healing” and was a strong supporter of reparations for slavery explaining that on an “emotional psychological and spiritual” level the country couldn’t afford not to pay them.  “A politics of conscience is still yet possible. And yes….love will prevail” Williamson wrote at the end of her statement on Friday. Williamson was also unsuccessful in her 2014 campaign for California's 33rd congressional district seat.

369,None,As Biden once the solid favorite in Democrat primary polls continues to tank the usual suspects are emerging to pin his fall from grace on the Kremlin and not Biden’s own mouth problematic family members or uninspiring policies. The former vice president’s once-certain status as the establishment favorite for the nomination has faded with even CNN taking shots at him recently after he lied about his early and enthusiastic support for the Iraq war. Institutional Russophobes would have voters believe their growing disillusionment with the moderate centrist was implanted by Kremlin propaganda however.  “US intelligence and law enforcement officials” are already probing whether Biden is the target of a Russian “disinformation” campaign according to two anonymous officials who spoke to Bloomberg on Friday.  Putting aside the insult implicit in telling voters who dislike Biden that their opinions are not their own the claim – unsupported by evidence in the manner of most 'Russian meddling' allegations – suggests that Democrats are already bracing for the loss of the 2020 election and rushing to get the narrative scaffolding in place to explain away a second Trump victory.  Even after the “Russia hacked the 2016 election” narrative fell apart with the ignominious “no further indictments” conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation boomeranging into an Inspector General inquiry and a criminal probe of the FBI malfeasance that kicked off the whole affair the American political elite don’t seem to be able to resist the temptation to blame Russia yet again. Bloomberg’s breathless report blames Russia for promoting Biden’s own Ukrainian scandal while Trump was being impeached over allegedly withholding military aid to pressure Kiev into restarting a probe of the natural gas firm where Biden’s son was a director. The case against Trump was shaky from the start and only Democrats’ white-hot hatred for the president pushed it to the level of an impeachable offense.  Yet the much more solid quid-pro-quo case against Biden – who publicly bragged about bullying Ukraine into firing its chief prosecutor by withholding $1 billion in IMF loan guarantees – went largely ignored in the US media except for conservative outlets. This is hardly “disinformation” unless Bloomberg is using the Newspeak definition floated in a recent academic paper that includes “truths arranged to serve a particular purpose.”  It is simply assumed Russia would want Trump to be president for four more years even though he scrapped arms treaties and piled more sanctions on the country and nearly led the US into a catastrophic war with Iran. Nevertheless former FBI agent Clint Watts – one of the minds behind the notorious Hamilton 68 “Russian bot” dashboard – nevertheless insists “a second term of Trump would be great” for Moscow. National Counterintelligence and Security Center director William Evanina warns Russian “influence campaigns” will only grow commandeering “new vectors of disinformation” to hoodwink the American public. Biden has repeatedly bragged “Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be president” accusing the Russian president of sending an “army of bots” after him. Like Hillary Clinton before him Biden has focused more on demonizing Trump than touting his own record possibly because his service in an administration that turned two wars into seven left Libya a failed state and allowed a huge amount of wealth to “trickle up” from the working class to the rich diverges wildly from even the tepidly pro-middle class pro-peace positions outlined on his campaign website. Even when he’s not making what the media has decided to politely call “gaffes” bursting blood vessels in his eye on live TV or sniffing little girls’ hair Biden offers little more than reheated Obama-era policies without Barack Obama’s smooth stage presence. Evidence shows it is the Democratic Party’s insistence on embracing middle-of-the-road candidates ideologically indistinguishable from most Republicans – not “Russian disinformation” – that is hurting them at the polls. Pinning Biden’s failure on Russia however has repercussions that reach much further than just a single candidate’s campaign or a single election. With the first primaries rapidly approaching intelligence agencies are pushing the “election meddling” story hard hoping to make lemonade out of the lemon that a second Trump victory would be.  Not only Russia but China and Iran will “seek to interfere in the voting process or influence voter perceptions” a joint statement from seven agencies in November warned. Literally anything could be construed as “influencing voter perceptions” and that’s the point: to retroactively paint perfectly innocent reporting as agitprop. This paves the way for a major crackdown on alt-media and other forms of dissent – one that has arguably alreadybegun.

370,None,The US Naval Forces Central Command on Friday accused a “Russian Navy ship” of provoking a near-collision with the US Navy destroyer USS Farragut in the North Arabian Sea. In a statement that was promptly picked up by many western outlets the US Navy said that the Russian vessel had “aggressively approached” the American destroyer during the incident on Thursday. It claimed the Russian ship ignored its warnings about a potential collision before ultimately altering its course. “While the Russian ship took action the initial delay in complying with international rules while it was making an aggressive approach increased the risk of collision.” Russia’s Ministry of Defence responded by calling the US claim “not consistent with reality.” It further explained that it was in fact the USS Farragut that crossed the path of the Russian ship in violation of international maritime regulations and called the American crew’s actions “unprofessional.” The ministry also said that the two videos shot by the Americans actually prove that the Russian vessel had the right of way. One of them shows the Russian ship sailing to the right of the US destroyer without making any dangerous maneuvers. The two ships can be seen gradually coming closer to each other however. The second video shows the Russian ship sailing closely behind the USS Farragut before it turns away to seemingly avoid a potential collision. The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea – a 1972 convention regulating the rules of navigation in the open sea – states that “the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall if the circumstances of the case admit avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.” If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/news/477976-us-russian-ships-aggressive-approach/,0.8103348531782467
371,None,“I have asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to be prepared to bring to the Floor next week a resolution to appoint managers and transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate” Pelosi (D-California) wrote in a letter to House Democrats on Friday. “Pelosi caves” declared Senator Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) who authored the motion to change the Senate rules so the charges could be dismissed if the House continued to withhold them. Having rushed to impeach Trump on December 18 arguing he posed a “clear and present danger” to US national security and the very fabric of democracy Democrats proceeded to sit on the articles for over three weeks. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) sought to use them as leverage to force the Senate Republican leadership to accept their terms for the trial. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) rebuffed all of their requests and eventually signed up to Hawley’s proposal. Pelosi and Schumer claimed there was “new evidence” that could come to light during the Senate trial pointing to a statement by former national security adviser John Bolton that he would be willing to testify if asked. McConnell countered that the rules for the impeachment trial were set in 1999 for President Bill Clinton and that he had no intention of changing them.  Republicans pointed to the delays as proof the Democrats were not serious and that the entire process was a partisan attempt to overturn the 2016 election. No Republicans voted in favor of the articles of impeachment while at least one Democrat dissented on one or both of them. They also pointed to Pelosi holding a vote to approve the trade deal with Mexico and Canada a day after the impeachment and inviting Trump to deliver the annual State of the Union address on February 4 as if nothing had happened. Pelosi did not get “a single one of her absurd demands because her own party got fed up with her games” said House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana). The speaker denied there was any dissent in her party however telling reporters on Friday that she had “absolutely total cooperation” from fellow Democrats.  “We have 1000 flowers blossoming beautifully in our caucus” she added using the phrase commonly attributed to Chinese leader Mao Zedong during a short-lived campaign to promote dissent within the Communist party in 1957.

372,None,Martin Scorsese’s ‘The Irishman’ may be an awards favorite at the moment but a spotlight was just blasted onto one of the movie’s most glaring flaws: the de-aging of its star cast. Robert De Niro Joe Pesci Al Pacino and others are de-aged throughout the film which tells a story that spans three decades. Even positive reviews of the Netflix feature which debuted in November pointed out that the de-aging CGI effects were lacking in the believability department. Now YouTube user iFake a deepfake video specialist has released their own video de-aging the actors with free technology and then comparing the results to those of Netflix which reportedly spent well over $100 million on the Martin Scorsese-directed feature.  The video reportedly took only seven days to make (it’s only a few minutes long) and the results show the characters in the actual Netflix movie to be a bit too rough around the edges and unfinished.  Though many Hollywood insiders are likely hesitant to criticize Scorsese and company in the middle of awards season this new video is already earning fans. ‘The Grey’ and ‘Narc’ director Joe Carnahan took to Twitter to praise the video and throw some shade at the effects in Scorsese’s effort. “All I can say about this is HOLY S**T” the director tweeted. After one user responded by saying iFake was at an advantage since they were de-aging the already de-aged footage from the film Carnahan doubled down on his criticisms. “Then that's what they should have been doing. Results is results guys. We can say it's 2k and wouldn't hold up yadda-yadda but the stuff on the right looks better than the stuff on the left” he wrote.  Some critics have begun turning on Scorsese’s vision as well. “It’s enough to make you wonder whether outspoken big-screen advocate Scorsese spent all that money in an effort to try to bankrupt Netflix from the inside” Joe Berkowitz wrote for Fast Company about the new video just one of many critics to praise the effects of the deepfake video of Scorsese’s film.

373,None,Cybersecurity was nonexistent in Microsoft’s audio transcription and rating program according to a former contractor who spoke to the Guardian on Friday. The company sent contractors a username and password in plaintext unencrypted email using the same password for everyone who joined in a given year. They also neglected to vet workers the ex-contractor said adding that they merely took his bank account details when he was hired.  Other than the popular VoIP and messaging service the Cortana voice assistant is also claimed to have been affected. Theoretically any contractor could access the account of any other allowing one “bad apple” to wreak immense havoc on the system while covering their tracks.Nor were there any security measures in place to protect the recordings contractors listened to the ex-employee said.  These were accessed over the open internet in China where the companies Microsoft outsourced to were located. This the report emphasizes means users’ data could be pilfered or otherwise misused not only by a rogue contractor but also by the Chinese government.  What it does not mention is that the American government has had access to Microsoft users’ data at least since the company became the first tech firm to join the NSA’s PRISM program in 2007 or that Microsoft actually helped the NSA penetrate its encryption. While it’s now common (if controversial) knowledge that AI voice assistants like Cortana Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa have human “helpers” rating their performance by listening to snippets of recordings Microsoft extended the practice to Skype calls that used its real-time AI translation feature. The company admitted in its privacy policy that it would “analyze audio” of calls but it did not spell out the possibility of un-vetted contractors halfway around the world accessing that audio over insecure internet connections - often in the comfort of their own homes according to the former contractor who claims to have heard “all kinds of unusual conversations including what could have been domestic violence.” Cortana is often triggered accidentally meaning some recordings are made without the user’s knowledge. Like Apple and Google before it Microsoft now claims it has ended its human grading program for Skype and Cortana for Xbox. The remaining audio reviewers have been relocated to “secure facilities” which Microsoft was careful to point out are not located in China. “We review short snippets of de-identified voice data from a small percentage of customers to help improve voice-enabled features” Microsoft said in a statement in defense of its practices acknowledging that “we sometimes engage partner companies in this work.” The snippets it maintained are “typically fewer than ten seconds long” and not linked to longer conversations. The massive security lapse doesn’t speak well of Microsoft’s security software particularly the Pentagon-backed “ElectionGuard” that will supposedly be guarding Americans’ votes from malicious interference in November.

374,None,The man had no known address and was detained on the Flagler Memorial Bridge on Friday morning. He had “several knives” and an undisclosed amount of cash on him according to WPTV. Other local outlets claimed the man’s arsenal included a machete two knives a pick axe and $22000 in cash and that a bomb squad was searching his vehicle found at the Palm Beach International Airport. The now-deleted photos by a WPEC-TV reporter showed a Saturn getting towed away from the parking garage with ‘I’m Germany’ [sic] written on the back window. The arrest comes just days after Iran fired missiles at two US bases in Iraq in revenge for the US drone attack that killed Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps General Qassem Soleimani at the Baghdad international airport. There were no casualties in Iran's strikes and both Trump and the Islamic Republic chose not to escalate the situation any further. There were multiple reports in Western media that Iran had offered an $80 million bounty for the killing of Trump but those reports were based on comments made by an unidentified mourner at Soleimani’s funeral rather than an actual government announcement.   The bridge where the suspect was arrested is less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) north of Mar-a-Lago the resort Trump favors on the weekends and holidays. Federal officials were involved in the investigation according to WPBF-TV. Mar-a-Lago has been a popular destination for tourists hoping to get a glimpse of the US president. In two instances so far Chinese tourists that made their way to the private club grounds have been detained by the authorities. A 56-year-old woman was arrested for trespassing on December 18 while a 33-year-old pleaded guilty to an earlier trespassing incident in April. Like this story?

375,None,Home Secretary Priti Patel filed a formal extradition request on Friday for Anne Sacoolas who struck 19-year-old Harry Dunn with her car last August while driving on the wrong side of the road near a joint US-UK military base in Northamptonshire. Dunn who was riding a motorbike did not survive. “The Home Office has sent an extradition request to the United States for Anne Sacoolas on charges of causing death by dangerous driving” the Home Office said in a statement. “This is now a decision for the US authorities.” The authorities in question wasted little time in voicing disapproval to the request with the US State Department calling it “highly inappropriate” and stating that it would “establish an extraordinarily troubling precedent.” Soon after the crash Sacoolas was granted diplomatic immunity and allowed to leave the country but some UK officials have questioned the move with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab opening a probe into the matter last Fall arguing the immunity rules in place were not “right.” While British prosecutors charged Sacoolas for reckless driving in December she has so far refused to “return voluntarily” to face the music with Sacoolas’ lawyer saying she would not risk jail time in the UK for a “terrible but unintentional accident.” The US State Department meanwhile said it was “disappointed” by the decision to bring charges insisting Sacoolas’ diplomatic status should insulate her from all legal consequences. Some netizens couldn’t help but draw comparisons between Sacoolas’ case and that of WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange who currently awaits proceedings for extradition to the US in a maximum security UK prison over his role in publishing classified material. Sacoolas’ treatment at the hands of the authorities of both countries sits in stark contrast to Assange’s however who has been deprived of a proper legal defense and health care. Like this story?

376,None,The FAA said Boeing had “failed to adequately oversee its suppliers to ensure they complied with the company's quality assurance system” in a statement on Friday adding that it had “knowingly submitted aircraft for final FAA airworthiness certification after determining that the parts could not be used due to a failed strength test.” The aviation regulator announced in June that over 300 Boeing aircraft might contain faulty components which could injure passengers or prevent planes from landing safely and said it would require the company to replace the parts. While the company has taken a serious hit in quarterly earnings over the last year after a series of fatal crashes involving the 737 MAX – which has been grounded worldwide since last March – each year Boeing counts its profits in the billions making the proposed fine a barely perceptible slap on the wrist. Boeing’s recently ousted CEO Dennis Muilenburg who was fired in December as the company struggled in the aftermath of the MAX crashes was given $62 million in benefits as he departed the firm – a sum dwarfing the FAA’s latest fine. He was slated to receive a “severance” package and stocks worth millions more but forfeited the offer. Like this story?

377,None,Located along the highly strategic Strait of Hormuz which it shares with Iran Oman under Qaboos maintained better relations with the Islamic Republic than any other Gulf nation. Throughout his tenure on the throne the sultan also played a role in mediating dialogue between American and Iranian leaders often serving as a go-between for the two sides. Just last December Omani delegations met with top diplomats in both Tehran and Washington in the space of a week encouraging Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to urge for a reduction in tensions across the Persian Gulf. Oman was the only member of the Gulf Cooperation Council to refrain in 2015 from joining the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen. In November the country brokered 'indirect' talks between Saudi Arabia and Yemen’s Houthi rebel movement looking to resolve the five-year conflict that’s produced one of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. On that front too Oman has offered a hand providing desperately needed aid to Yemenis.Qaboos has ruled the Gulf Arab state since 1970 when he led the bloodless overthrow of Sultan Said bin Taimur – his father – with backing from Britain formerly a colonial power in Oman.  Before he took the throne Oman had fewer than 10 kilometers of paved road one hospital and no secondary schools. By 1980 ten years into Qaboos’ rule the country had some 12000 kilometers of asphalt roadways 363 schools and 28 hospitals according to anthropologist Mandana Limbert. The ruler struggled with a bout of health problems and was flown to Belgium last month for treatment for colon cancer after which he was said to be in “stable condition.” Omani authorities offered few additional details about his status after he returned home. Qaboos had no children and never appointed a successor publicly leaving some question about the line of succession. A statute passed in 1996 however tasks the royal family with appointing the next sultan within three days after the throne becomes vacant. Think your friends would be interested?

Haitham bin Tariq Al-Said pledged to follow the late sultan's 'non-interference' policy based on peaceful coexistence and maintaining friendly ties with all nations.

379,None,Soleimani was killed by a US drone strike on January 3 as he was being driven with others near Baghdad international airport. In reprisal Iran launched a limited strike on US bases in Iraq with ballistic missiles on Tuesday causing no casualties but demonstrating a capability to hit US assets at will. The weekly Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS/ISIL) newspaper Al-Naba portrayed Soleimani’s death as an act of god in support of its cause and Muslims in general according to BBC Monitoring. An editorial in the jihadi paper was careful not to credit the US or even mention Soleimani by name. It couched the gloating in a historical analogy referring to “Roman-Persian wars” that enabled early Muslims to overrun both Persia – today’s Iran – and parts of the Eastern Roman Empire also known as Byzantium. The paper also reported on the US and its allies suspending operations against IS as an opportunity for the group’s resurgence according to BBC journalist Mina Al-Lami. While IS has not been entirely destroyed it has not controlled any territory for months. Soleimani’s Quds Force fighters were among those that turned the tide against the IS ‘caliphate’ alongside the Syrian Army and the Russian expeditionary force in Syria – while the US-backed Iraqi army and Kurdish militias advanced from northern Syria and Iraq. Citing the possibility IS might reappear the US is refusing to withdraw from Iraq in open disregard for its ‘partners’ in the government in Baghdad. Iraqi lawmakers passed a nonbinding resolution demanding US withdrawal shortly after Soleimani’s killing but the US State Department said on Friday that no such thing would be happening. Both the US and several of its NATO allies have suspended their training of Iraqi security forces for the moment as they braced for Iranian reprisals. Some allies even pulled their personnel out of Iraq to neighboring Kuwait. However US President Donald Trump has called for an expanded role for NATO in Iraq. Like this story?

381,None,"The Army General Staff stressed that the tragic mistake was made amid the flare-up of tensions with Washington. The nation's air defenses were placed on alert and ready to ""respond to possible threats of the highest level"" after US President Donald Trump warned that the Pentagon would strike targets on Iranian soil if US citizens or assets were attacked by Iran. On Wednesday the Iranian Army fired a volley of ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq that house American troops. It was a retaliation in response to a US drone strike which killed top Iranian military chief Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad's airport. For several hours after the missile attacks the army was detecting increased activity of US warplanes around the country and received alerts of possible airstrikes on ""strategic sites"" across Iran the General Staff said. The Kiev-bound Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 which took off from Tehran's airport the same day was approaching ""an important military site"" of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) while traveling at the altitude of a ""hostile flight"" the statement noted.

383,None,As Iran and the United States seemingly limbered up for war Russia and Germany as the continent’s two most powerful countries have a special responsibility to protect it from any fallout. Merkel’s decision to travel to the Russian capital may be conceived as a signal to Washington that: a) Berlin remains capable of mounting an independent foreign policy if pushed b) the Germans won’t be cowed by sanctions the US has placed on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline which further connects their country directly to Russia’s gas supply network and c) Merkel wants the US leadership to know she agrees with Moscow about Donald Trump’s order to murder Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Russia has labeled it “reckless” and the Germans have questioned the legality of the killing. Especially given that she was already due to visit Moscow in May for the 75th anniversary of Soviet Russia’s victory over the Nazis. Washington’s move to sanction the pipeline amounted to straight-up racketeering right out of the mafia playbook. It’s trying to force Germany a supposed ally to buy liquefied gas from US companies which is more expensive than the product it gets from long-time supplier Russia. Germany and Russia need each other. They are Europe’s most powerful economies measured by purchasing power parity. And together they are home to around a third of its population. Moscow relies on revenue from its exports to the German market and Berlin would be in serious bother without access to Russian resources. Geopolitically they also complement each other in many ways. From all points west of the Poland-Belarus border Berlin is the most influential player. But east of that and south of the Black Sea Moscow is in the driving seat. The Germans will be eager to see how Moscow’s influence in the Middle East can be leveraged – a region where they have little or no clout. On Saturday there is much to discuss with Libya Syria Iran and Ukraine top of the agenda. Just this week Iran and the US clashed in Iraq and Tehran gave up on an international nuclear deal which both Berlin and Moscow have championed although Donald Trump had already rendered it essentially useless last year. Meanwhile Turkey which both Merkel and Putin view as an important player sent soldiers to Libya.  Ukraine itself is another important issue for the two leaders given that it has driven a wedge between Germany and Russia for well over half a decade now. Put plainly Moscow believes that the EU over-reached by attempting to bring Kiev into its sphere of influence in 2013 although it accepts the heavy lifting was done by pro-US/NATO elements in Brussels and is aware Berlin was never super keen on EU membership for the Ukrainians. The Germans think Russia was overly aggressive in its response to the 2014 ‘Euromaidan.’ Berlin rejects Moscow’s re-absorption of Crimea believing it to be a dangerous ‘precedent’ in redrawing European borders (which of course ignores Germany’s own role in the collapse of Yugoslavia). And it also holds Russia responsible for fueling the Donbass conflict through its support for the self-declared republics. When it comes to Libya Putin and Merkel are basically on the same page – they both want an end to the fighting. They’ve never been especially personally friendly but Putin will miss Merkel when she finally steps down. The German chancellor is the last remaining Western leader who featured in both his stretches as Russian president. This year will be pivotal in terms of what sort of Germany-Russia relationship she leaves behind. The countdown begins on Saturday.

Korea will not make any new generous proposals like it did before – for instance dismantling of nuclear facilities in exchange for UN sanctions relief – and won't seek engaging into talks with the US altogether until the latter makes some real concessions first. ""The reopening of dialogue between the DPRK and the U.S. may be possible only under the condition of the latter's absolute agreement on the issues raised by the former but we know well that the US is neither ready nor able to do so"" the statement reads. Pyongyang also did not miss the opportunity to take a jab at its southern counterpart mocking the efforts of Seoul to convey Trump's birthday wishes to Kim and to become a mediator in US-N. Korea relations altogether. The country's leader has already received the wishes from Trump ""through a personal letter"" beforehand the Foreign Ministry stated suggesting that Seoul has apparently overlooked the ""special liaison channel"" between the top leaders of US and N. Korea. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story! ", https://www.rt.com/news/478000-trump-kim-feelings-talks/,0.8103641719570598

389,None,The short video was captured by a surveillance camera at a parking lot presumably located on the outskirts of the Iranian capital. Footage shows the launch of a projectile which goes vertically upwards and apparently explodes off-screen causing a bright flash of light. The authenticity of the video however remains under question. The date mark on the footage says it was actually shot on Friday whereas the Boeing went down near Tehran on Wednesday. A car sitting in the parking lot also appears to have had its alarm set-off well before the launch and the flash. It indicates the vehicle had possibly been startled by some loud noises beforehand and the launch seen in the video might have been not the only one. On Saturday Tehran admitted that the passenger aircraft was downed by the country's air-defenses in an “unintentional” missile launch vowing to investigate the incident thoroughly and to bring those responsible to justice.

390,None,"The INS Vikramaditya with a fleet of MiG-29K fighter jets on board has arrived to monitor large nine-day naval exercise 'Sea Guardians 2020' which was kicked off by Beijing and Islamabad in the northern part of the Arabian Sea on Monday. The Navy spokesperson praised the ""high levels of motivation &amp; #willtowin that were evident onboard the 'Queen of the Battle'"" as the flagship carrier is often called in India. Military sources told PTI that the top officials from the Navy HQ were present on board. They also said that the ship was sent on a voyage with ""a strategic objective"" but did not disclose further details. The carrier was reportedly testing out new hardware as well. A prototype of the HAL Tejas light combat aircraft (LCA) has successfully taken off from the ship's flight deck and landed on it on Saturday military sources told NDTV and Hindustan Times. By doing so the Tejas has become the first Indian-built jet to land on an aircraft carrier. China brought five big warships for its drill with Pakistan including the guided-missile destroyer Yinchuan and the guided-missile frigate Yuncheng while Islamabad sent two Zulfiquar-class frigates among other vessels. Pakistan's Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi said that the joint maneuvers highlight ""the long-term relationship and mutual trust"" between the nations. New Delhi has been tracking the increased activity of Chinese ships in the Indian Ocean. Last month the Indian Navy reported that it had chased away a Chinese surveillance vessel after it had supposedly entered the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in September.  China is also absent from the list of more than 40 nations that India invited to participate in its major Milan 2020 naval drill next year. Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh explained in December that Beijing was not invited because India was calling only the ""like-minded"" countries. India and Pakistan nearly went to an all-out war last February when cross-border shelling was accompanied with the first case of open aerial combat since 1971. After a brief period of friendly gestures the tensions between the neighbors began rising again since last summer as India revoked the longstanding autonomy of the part of the disputed Kashmir it controls and reorganized the region. Indian authorities argue that the changes in Kashmir will help fighting terrorism and that better integration into India proper will boost the region's economy. The country also recently adopted a citizenship law which simplifies naturalization for several religious groups that have arrived from Afghanistan Bangladesh and Pakistan but does not do the same for Muslims. Pakistani officials have blasted the law as discriminatory. India denies these allegations saying that the legislation is aimed at protecting the persecuted minorities coming from the Muslim-majority states and is not detrimental to Muslims in any way.

391,None,“After hearing about the crash of the Ukrainian plane I wished to die” Hajizadeh said during a press conference on Saturday. The commander explained that the incident had occurred as the country was bracing for potential US strikes and that the “likelihood of conflict” between the two nations has been “unprecedented” since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. According to an early assessment the Ukrainian plane was erroneously identified as an incoming cruise missile which resulted in the tragedy. Air-defense units received a warning that cruise missiles had been fired at the country and stayed on high alert at the time of the incident Hajizadeh stated. The commander of the anti-aircraft unit had sought confirmation for the launch from his superiors but experienced communication problems and had to make the decision –which turned out to be wrong– on his own. The officer only had 10 seconds to make the decision Hajizadeh added. Hajizadeh stated that the IRGC notified the authorities that it had likely hit the plane back right after the incident yet this information was not disclosed to the public while the crash site was being investigated. Neither IRGC nor the country’s military sought to hide the incident the due procedure was to be followed he explained. Like this story?

Tehran had originally asked Canada France and the US to send over the required equipment and software but they refused Rezaeifar said. Iran then proposed for the black box to be decoded at an ""impartial"" facility overseas where the data could be extracted without any damage to it. France was chosen because it has an agreement with Iran for extracting data from flight recorders the official explained. The lead investigator stated the decision was supported by the US as well as Ukraine Canada Britain and Sweden whose citizens were on board the doomed plane. France has formally requested a probe by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) into the plane crash Ukrainian President's Administration said in a statement on Volodymyr Zelensky's phone call with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.They have agreed that French experts will work on extracting the data from the flight recorder. Iran admitted that its air defenses mistook the plane for a ""hostile target"" and shot it down shortly after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday killing all 176 people on board. While accepting responsibility for the tragedy the Iranian Army said it was on high alert after US President Donald Trump threatened to bomb targets on Iranian territory during the most-recent flare-up of US-Iranian tensions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Iran to conduct a transparent investigation of the incident without delay and to make sure that Ukrainian experts participate in the probe.

394,None,The nationwide strike against pension reforms has entered its 38th day in France coinciding with ‘Act 61’ of demonstrations by the Yellow Vests the movement that has been protesting state austerity measures each weekend for over a year now. Tensions this Saturday appear to be particularly high as clashes between the protesters and law enforcement erupted in multiple locations across the country. In Paris the protesters were seen pelting police with stones trying to erect barricades in the streets as well as setting dumpsters on fire. Law enforcement in turn responded with volleys of tear gas that creeped through the streets as a large whitish toxic cloud.  A billboard –reportedly advertising a bank– was also set on fire with flames then engulfing the adjacent residential building.  The rallies in several other French cities appear to be as turbulent as in the country’s capital. In Nantes for instance the police was seen trying to disperse the crowds using two fire hoses as well as liberally deploying tear gas. Scuffles between the police and the protesters have also erupted in Montpellier Caen and other locations. In Rouen the rowdy protesters tried to block the streets with garbage cans and other objects which yet again prompted the police to deploy tear gas as well as to baton charge the crowds. Observers filming the clashes from their apartment ‘received’ a tear gas grenade from the police right into it. Fortunately they escaped the incident unscathed except from suffering exposure to the gas while the grenade left burn marks on their floor. The Rouen incident prompted inevitable comparisons with the fate of Zineb Redouane an 80-year-old woman from Marseille who died a year ago after getting hit by a police grenade in her face. Redouane was at her apartment during a Yellow Vests rally and merely came up to her window to close it when the projectile struck her in the face. The anti-pension-reform protests which have received massive support from French trade unions kicked off early in December. They came in the form of mass rallies strikes work walkouts and attempts to disrupt vital infrastructure. The unrest was triggered by the government plan for a reform that will see the country’s 42 pension plans merged into a single points-based one. While the authorities insist the main goal of the reform is to make the pension more transparent and simple its critics believe the government is basically trying to rip workers off stealing their hard-earned benefits.

395,None,Both leaders believe that the 2015agreement also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) still can and should be preserved despite the latest spike in tensions sparked by the US assassination of a top Iranian general. Speaking to journalists in Moscow following her meeting with Putin Merkel said that “everything must be done to keep the JCPOA going” and vowed to use “all the diplomatic tools to help this agreement.” Putin also described the deal as “tremendously important” and said that both Moscow and Berlin agree that all parties need to “come back to the deal.” Iran has rolled back all the restrictions it had committed-to under the 2015 nuclear deal following the US assassination of Quds Force commander Major General Qassem Soleimani as well as a barrage of crippling sanctions imposed by Washington after America itself left the agreement. Putin further expressed hope that a special-purpose vehicle called INSTEX Europe created to facilitate trade with Iran and circumvent US sanctions would soon “be up and running” and that European nations “would deliver on their promise to create an independent mechanism free of the dollar influence.” So far Europe’s endeavors in this area have not been particularly successful. The mechanism was originally created in early 2019 but was apparently limited to what the European nations called high-priority “humanitarian goods” such as food and medical supplies. Meanwhile European companies have been in no rush to trade with Iran out of fear of losing the American market as a result of possible sanctions.

396,None,Demonstrators gathered in the Kelvingrove Park from where they set out on a march to the Glasgow Green Park around 11:30 GMT. Crowds of people flooded the streets in the center of Scotland’s largest city. The marchers were waving Scottish national flags and were holding banners and placards in support of the referendum as well as of Scotland’s independence from the UK. A group of demonstrators were wearing kilts — a part of the Scottish national costume — and were playing bagpipes. The march was organized by a grassroots pro-independence movement ‘All Under One Banner’ (AUOB) which insists it is not aligned with any political force. It is the first such event out of at least eight that the group plans to hold across Scotland this year. The next one is scheduled for April and will be held in Arbroath on the 700th anniversary of the signing of Scotland’s declaration of independence. Initially AUOB also planned to stage a rally after the march but it was called off due to safety concerns in light of weather warnings. This fact however did not apparently discourage people from turning to the streets in support of the referendum. The exact number of demonstrators is not known yet the organizers expected up to 100000 to attend the event. Scotland already held a referendum in 2014 when the push for independence was defeated in a narrow popular vote as 55 percent of those who took part in it chose to stay in the UK. Yet after the Scottish National Party gained 45 percent of the votes during the latest UK general elections in Scotland and won 48 out of 59 Scottish seats in the House of Commons the idea of another referendum was once again put on the table by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. Speaking a week after the general elections Sturgeon said that her government has “a clear democratic mandate to offer people a choice on that future in an independence referendum and the UK Government has a democratic duty to recognize that.” She also vowed to consider “all options” should the British government turn down her bid for the second referendum. Yet that appears exactly what London plans to do. In December the UK government rejected Sturgeon’s demands arguing that it would be a “damaging distraction” for the UK after it leaves the EU.

401,None,It appears Meghan Markle has traded in the royal family for Hollywood as a new report reveals she has signed a deal to do voiceover work for Disney. The move follows Markle and her husband Prince Harry announcing they are taking a step back from the royal family and becoming financially independent.  Markle who was an actress long before she was Duchess of Sussex will perform voiceover work for Disney in exchange for a donation to Elephants Without Borders an organization that works to protect animals from poaching.  While a noble goal the donation could also be viewed as a PR spin considering Markle has been dealing with bad press following her and Prince Harry’s decision to move on from the royal family. If good PR was the goal it does not seem to have worked as many are taking news of Markle’s Disney deal as another sign of her trying to build her celebrity status at the expense of her husband. “This woman has always been absolutely desperate to be a celebrity” commenter Katie Hopkins said of Markle in a video that has been viewed more than half-a-million times. The report from The Times suggests members of the royal family were aware of the Disney deal before Christmas and were not happy about it.

However our fight against terrorist organizations that seized Tripoli and received support of some countries will continue until the end” he said through a representative. Haftar’s position seems to have changed now. The Tripoli-based government led by PM Fayez al-Sarraj backed the ceasefire immediately releasing a statement late Wednesday that showed its full support for “any serious calls for the resumption of the political process and the elimination of the specter of war.” Libya has been torn apart by warring factions seeking control of the nation since a US-led NATO intervention to overthrow the government of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

411,None,The eruption began on Sunday and was caught on video by numerous bystanders as well as surveillance cameras used to monitor the volcano. While Taal has been quiet since 1977 when the last major eruption occurred it has been exhibiting increased seismic activity over the past few years. The initial eruption is described as phreatic – meaning it occurs when heated magma evaporates ground or surface water. The plume darkened shortly afterwards indicating that the steam was joined by actual volcanic ash.  As if footage of the eruption didn’t already look menacing enough several lightning strikes have been observed in the area. The lightning bolts were seen hitting the center of the ash column which is towering over the volcano. As well as ‘enjoying’ a doomsday view nearby communities have experienced an ashfall shortly after the eruption. The eruption has prompted the evacuation of people living in the immediate vicinity of the volcano with some 8000 locals affected. Communities on the shores of the Taal lake were told to watch out for potential water disturbances and high waves that might be created by the increased seismic activity. The spike in the mountain's activities prompted the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) to upgrade its threat level twice within an hour. The alert level skyrocketed from 'abnormal' to 'magmatic unrest' suggesting that the volcano might even spew some lava.  Later in the day the alert was raised even further and now it stands at level four – ‘hazardous eruption imminent.’ The complex volcano rises from the waters of its namesake lake featuring a number of craters. Its largest crater has a small lake of its own.   The Taal belongs to the so-called 'Decade Volcanos' – 16 mountains known for violent and deadly eruptions in the past and therefore considered worthy of close study and monitoring. The greatest recorded eruption of the Taal occurred back in 1754 and lasted for nearly eight months. The deadliest eruption occurred in 1911 claiming the lives of over 1300 people and effectively wiping out all human settlements on the volcanic island. Think your friends would be interested?

412,None,"“Today Rob Macaire was summoned because of his unconventional behavior of attending an illegal rally on Saturday” the Iranian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It also demanded that the British government provide clarification on the matter. The diplomat was briefly detained late on Saturday outside of Amirkabir University in Tehran as part of a group of people attending a chaotic vigil – held for the victims of the Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crash – which turned into an anti-government rally. According to Iranian state media the official was seeking “to organize instigate and direct some radical and destructive actions.” While many people brought candles and flowers to the event seeking to mourn the dead some showed up with anti-government banners and began chanting slogans demanding “prosecutions and constitutional changes.” The event escalated into clashes between the police and protesters who were ultimately dispersed. The ambassador however maintains that he was only seeking to attend the vigil. The Ukrainian plane was accidentally downed by Iranian air defenses on Wednesday after the passenger jet was mistaken for an incoming cruise missile. “Thanks for the many goodwill messages. Can confirm I wasn’t taking part in any demonstrations! Went to an event advertised as a vigil for victims of #PS752 tragedy” the diplomat tweeted earlier on Sunday insisting that he was detained half an hour after he left the event. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the incident a “flagrant violation of international law” insisting that Macaire was detained without any ""grounds or explanation.” Commenting on the issue the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell called for “de-escalation and space for diplomacy”. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the British ambassador was arrested “because of his participation in an illegal gathering” but he was released “due to his diplomatic immunity and after confirming his identity”. The country´s Deputy FM Seyed Abbas Araghchi explained in a tweet that he was deeply surprised the arrested man turned to be the UK ambassador. Meanwhile Macaire’s participation in the rally – whatever his true motive – prompted an angry reaction from the Basij militia. The militia – which is subordinate to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – staged a rally outside the UK embassy and according to local media demanded its closure.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier hailed Qaboos as “a true friend of India” who did a lot for “a vibrant strategic partnership” between the two nations. “I will always cherish the warmth and affection I received from him” Modi tweeted. Modi also called Qaboos “a beacon of peace for our region and the world.” Qaboos who passed away at 79 on Friday after ruling Oman for five decades was known as a skilled mediator and described by experts as India’s key partner in the Persian Gulf region. He also studied in India as a young man. India is among Oman’s top trading partners and according to the Economic Times bilateral trade reached $5 billion in 2018/19.

414,None,"The volcano erupted on Sunday emitting a large column of steam and smoke and subjecting the surroundings to a heavy ashfall. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) has revised the alert level of the volcano several times through the day and currently it stands at level four – out of five possible – ‘hazardous eruption imminent’. The institute said two volcanic earthquakes have been registered while volcanic tremor persisted since 0300 am GMT. Earlier Manila international airport has suspended flights over the eruption of the Taal volcano located some 55 km to the south. ""Flight operations at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport have been temporarily suspended due to the volcanic ash from the eruption of Taal Volcano"" the Manila International Airport Authority stated. The eruption prompted the evacuation of some 8000 people living in the immediate vicinity of the restless hill which is located on an island in the waters of its namesake lake. People living in the communities on the shores of Taal Lake have been warned that the seismic activity could trigger potentially hazardous high waves. Heavy ashfall was recorded in the province of Cavite – located between the volcano and the capital city of Manila – prompting authorities to suspend classes at all levels on Monday. Affected residents are urged to stay indoors and to use dust masks and goggles if going outside is an absolute necessity.

415,None,“I believe the US sanctions will delay the project but will not end it” Mateusz Morawiecki told German newspaper Die Welt in an interview. Swiss-Dutch pipe-laying company Allseas stopped its work on the pipeline in December through fear of getting hit by the sanctions which were adopted by the US earlier that month. Morawiecki whose government argues that the project will make the EU too dependent on Russian gas called Berlin’s decision not to abandon Nord Stream 2 a “step in the wrong direction.”  “In Poland naturally we would prefer that the construction of Nord Stream 2 would have never begun” he said. The PM noted that despite Poland “regularly” voicing its concerns over the pipeline to German Chancellor Angela Merkel it “doesn’t change the fact that Warsaw and Berlin have different opinions on this issue.” Merkel has strongly opposed US attempts to derail the construction of the pipeline arguing that it will be beneficial for both Germany and the EU. During a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Saturday the chancellor stressed that Nord Stream 2 “will be implemented no matter what” and vowed to continue her support for the project. Putin said that Russia is capable of completing the project on its own and that although construction could take a few months longer it would be finished “either by the end of this year or early next year”.

416,None,Pickering power plant located on the shore of Lake Ontario sent out an alert stating that emergency staff are responding to an incident at the facility although “there has been no abnormal release of radioactivity from the station.” It also said that locals do not need to evacuate or take any other protective measures. Still scarce information about the nature of the supposed incident apparently did not reassure residents and the alert certainly got under the skin of quite a few people. They in turn soon sent Twitter into meltdown as hundreds of people turned to social media to voice their fears and skepticism about whether the situation was really safe. The panic on Twitter soon reached such proportions that #Chernobyl started trending in a matter of minutes. However it quickly turned out that the alarm was in fact false and there was no incident at the station so the alert was called off. It seems that not everyone was convinced though that there was no reason to remain alert. Others criticized Pickering power plant for issuing a false alert and sarcastically joked about the station’s staff not being particularly good at their jobs. Commissioned back in the early 1970s Pickering Nuclear Generating Station is the third-largest such facility in Canada. Located on the northern shore of Lake Ontario it currently has six operating reactors and generates about 15 percent of the province’s power. Like this story?

417,None,“We're willing to sit down and discuss without precondition a new way forward a series of steps by which Iran becomes a more normal country” Esper said on Sunday speaking on CBS’s ‘Face the Nation’.  Asked whether there was a contradiction between calling the Iranian authorities “corrupt” and openly siding with anti-government protesters yet expressing readiness to talk at the same time Esper assured the show’s host that it was a perfectly fine thing to do. Iranian authorities are “still a legitimate government” of the country he said and therefore Donald Trump’s offer to come and talk “without preconditions” still stands. His words come as the president and other US officials are busy issuing warnings to Tehran on how to deal with protests over the downing of a Ukrainian passenger jet. On Saturday the US president even went to the trouble of tweeting in both English and Farsi appealing directly to the Iranian protesters and expressing his full – and years-long – support for them. “To the brave long-suffering people of Iran: I’ve stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency and my Administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely and are inspired by your courage” Trump wrote warning Tehran against “another massacre of peaceful protesters” in a separate tweet. In fact senior US officials have repeatedly expressed willingness to talk to Tehran “with no preconditions” calling upon it to “behave like a normal nation.” While this definition appears vague it was actually summed up by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in June 2018 when yet another call for talks was accompanied by a list of demands which basically urged Iran to give up its independent policies and surrender to Washington to become a “normal country” again. Needless to say these ‘no-precondition’ proposals for talks tend to fall flat and only spark anger in Tehran. Think your friends would be interested?

418,None,Though his opening monologue and razor sharp jokes from this year’s Golden Globes telecast went viral and were heavily celebrated online Ricky Gervais no doubt made producers a little too uncomfortable with his takedown of Hollywood’s empty political activism as well as shining a light on the industry turning a blind eye to the deeds of people like disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein and the late Jeffrey Epstein. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler have been announced as the hosts of the 2021 ceremony. The pair last performed the task in 2015. NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association released statements about their excitement to have the two return but the decision isn’t going over too well with fans of Gervais’ Globes performance. “And with that move and the exit of Ricky Gervais with the inclusion of these two self-styled comedic wits with all of that the Golden Globes never again enjoyed a moment of their theretofore enjoyed popularity ever again” wrote one Twitter user in response.  “What @goldenglobes⁩ ?? No ⁦@rickygervais⁩ ?? Too bad. That’s the only way you would get big viewer numbers!! I’ll select ‘opt out’ to your lame self-indulging elitist awards” tweeted another user.  Fey and Poehler are about as far away from Gervais as you can get comedically. The two SNL alums cut their teeth as hosts making soft celebrity-friendly jokes and playing it safe. Fey made a name for herself by impersonating one of the easiest targets on the planet former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and Poehler has said Trump being president makes it “hard not to have a full-on panic attack every day.” Nothing says playing it safe in Hollywood like planting your flag as far to the political left as possible.  And zingers from past shows hosted by the two include Fey dropping dimes like “Meryl Streep is so brilliant in ‘August: Osage County’ proving that there are still great parts in Hollywood for Meryl Streeps over 60.” Wow. Cutting edge. Brutal. Gervais on the other hand has a comedy style that protects no one. Even the celebrities in the room are on the table. His opening monologue at the last ceremony was so brilliant because it was a takedown of the award show itself and the political elitist mess it had devolved into. With Fey and Poehler there won’t be discomfort in the room. There won’t be Weinstein jokes. There won’t be Epstein jokes. That may disappoint fans but it’s exactly what producers want after Gervais put their feet to the fire and laughed. Hollywood may love to lecture us but it definitely does not like being lectured.  Like this story?

419,None,At least eight ‘Katyusha’ rockets hit the base located some 80 kilometers north of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad the prime minister’s office has confirmed. The rockets allegedly struck a runaway located inside the facility military sources earlier told Reuters. There have been no casualties among the US military personnel. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the strikes somewhat surprisingly without immediately pinning the blame on ‘Iranian proxies’. US bases in Iraq were also hit by a ballistic missile attack from Iran on January 8. The move almost put the two nations on the brink of war but a large-scale conflict was eventually avoided. It is still unclear who might be behind the repeated attacks on the Iraqi base hosting American troops but such actions do not fit the strategy of Iran or the Popular Mobilization Forces – a group of Iran-backed Shia militias – Ammar Waqqaf a Middle East analyst told RT.  “These attacks use non-precise weapons. The margins of error are huge. Even if there were American forces at this base it is still not a solely American base there are Iraqi soldiers there. So whoever targets this base does not necessarily care about the Iraqi army or personnel” he said adding that Tehran eventually decided to focus on pushing American forces out of Iraq and out of the Middle East in general through diplomacy and influence on its neighbors rather than through military means. In fact anti-Iranian sentiment which has been on the rise in Iraq for quite some time went down in the wake of the assassination of Soleimani by the US Waqqaf noted adding that “there was some sympathy and unification among key factions” in Iraq. Tehran or pro-Iranian forces in Iraq would gain little if they shattered this unity by hitting some Iraqi personnel in an attack supposedly aimed against the US. Following the US's assassination of Soleimani the Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding resolution last week asking the government to expel foreign troops and to cancel the ongoing request for military assistance from the US-led coalition. Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi also asked US State Secretary Mike Pompeo to send a delegation to begin preparations for a troop pullout. Washington however made it clear that it would not discuss any withdrawal plans calling the US presence on Iraqi soil “appropriate.” Think your friends would be interested?

420,None,Secretary of Defense Mark Esper revealed in a Sunday interview with ‘Face the Nation’ on CBS that he “didn’t see” specific evidence that supported the president’s claim that Soleimani was planning attacks on four US embassies which Trump touted in a Friday interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham. “The president said that he believed that there probably could have been attacks against additional embassies” Esper said to host Margaret Brennan. “I shared that view. I know other members of the national security team shared that view.” “‘Probably and could have been’ that is — that sounds more like an assessment than a specific tangible threat with a decisive piece of intelligence” Brennan replied. “Well the president didn’t say there was a tangible — he didn’t cite a specific piece of evidence” Esper said. Asked if there was any specific evidence Esper then replied “I didn’t see one with regard to four embassies. What I’m saying is I shared the president’s view that probably my expectation is they were going to go after our embassies.” Esper later told CNN’s Jake Tapper that the president never claimed to have “specific evidence” of the imminent attacks he has warned Americans about.  The administration’s shaky reasoning for Soleimani’s assassination has earned them plenty of heat with some saying they can’t “keep their story straight.” “The public justification for this action has been all over the place from the beginning. They cannot keep their story straight. They’re just throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. Admitting it was an ideological revenge killing would be much more honest” journalist Mike Tracey tweeted in response to Esper’s ‘Face the Nation’ interview. Utah Senator Mike Lee similarly criticized the administration in a CNN interview where he said it’s “frustrating” to have the president warn of “imminent” attacks but to get “no details” about said attacks or the evidence behind the claims. Others saw it as the latest example of Trump lying. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also recently failed to provide any concrete evidence about the potential danger of Soleimani when he spoke to the press. Pompeo insisted Trump was given “multiple pieces of information” in regard to “imminent” dangers against the US but he failed to detail what that information was.  Despite struggling to explain the “imminence” of the situation Pompeo insisted “we got it right” with the assassination. He also insisted that “If you’re looking for imminence you needn’t look no further than the days that lead up to the strike.” If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/478078-trump-soleimani-esper-evidence/,0.8103968314427589
421,None,"US officials and establishment figures certainly spared no effort as they went out of their way to show how much they supposedly admire the ‘courage’ of Iranians who took to the streets to vent their anger at the fact that a Ukrainian passenger jet with many Iranians on board was mistakenly shot down by Iran's military – something Tehran admitted of its own volition before the results of the crash investigation were made public. However Washington apparently decided that this tragedy which took the lives of 176 people is a good enough reason to remind Iranians – who are already consumed by grief – just how much they are ‘suffering’ at the hands of a supposedly ‘oppressive’ regime that by sheer coincidence turns out to be America's arch-rival in the region. President Donald Trump spent the last couple of days tweeting compliments to the protesters and warnings to Tehran both in English and in Farsi. On Sunday he demanded that Tehran ""stop the killing of your great Iranian people."" There are no reports of deaths during the protests over the plane downing even though law enforcement had to deploy tear gas and water cannons against an agitated crowd on several occasions. Earlier the president went so far as to remind Iranians that he – who vowed just days ago to annihilate 52 targets on Iranian soil in the event of a conflict with Iran including prominent cultural sites – has allegedly stood with them since the beginning of his presidency. Other US officials also wasted little time before they joined the cheering chorus of the Iranian protesters' supporters. American Ambassador to the UK Woody Johnson took to social media on Sunday to express his admiration for the protesters and ""call out the cruel Khamenei regime."" Pentagon Chief Mark Esper meanwhile hinted at how Washington really views the protests sparked by the downing of the Ukrainian jet. ""You can see the Iranian people are standing up and asserting their rights their aspirations for a better government — a different regime"" he told CBS's 'Face the Nation'. Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton – a notorious American arch-hawk and a big fan of the idea of launching a war against Iran – was much blunter in his words openly stating that ""regime change is in the air"" and ""the people of Iran can see it."" State Secretary - and former CIA Chief - Mike Pompeo was the first though to try his hand at interpreting the ""voice of the Iranian people"" and stopped just short of openly calling for a regime change on Saturday. It is true that Iran is still reeling from the tragic Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crash. Aggrieved Iranians are hitting the streets of Tehran for the second day amid growing public outcry over the government's actions. When it comes to America's adversaries though any sign of protest sparks a keen interest in Washington. The reasons for this interest however do not appear to be humanitarian. During previous protests in Iran sparked by the rise in fuel costs Pompeo urged Iranians to send him videos of the police crackdown – but only so that “champions of democracy” in Washington could impose even more sanctions against the rival nation.

422,None,Netanyahu requested immunity after he was indicted in November on charges of bribery fraud and breach of public trust saying he needs “to continue to lead Israel to great achievements.” On Sunday Eyal Yinon the Knesset’s legal adviser issued a ruling that Speaker Yuli Edelstein should allow the formation of a Knesset House Committee that will look into the matter and is expected to reject the request. Edelstein who is part of Netanyahu’s Likud Party warned at a press conference in Jerusalem that “convening the Knesset committee” is a “grave mistake” as it will turn the legal process into a “jungle that will debase the honor of the legislative body.” Yinon delivered his opinion shortly before Edelstein’s press conference and said the speaker does not have the authority to block the formation of a committee to debate Netanyahu’s request for immunity.  When requesting immunity Netanyahu said it was only “temporary” and that “there is no possibility for anyone to avoid standing trial.” The prime minister has denied any wrongdoing and said that immunity laws exist to protect “elected officials from political lawsuits.” Israel has been facing political turmoil for quite some time with close election results in April and September last year preventing the formation of a government. A committee can usually only be formed afterthe government has been sworn in but with Yinon’s ruling this means one will need to be formed anyway. When Netanyahu’s request is rejected as many expect to happen then a corruption trial can officially begin.  And with Israel’s general election set for March 2 Netanyahu may become the first sitting prime minister to enter an election while on trial.

423,None,While speaking on ABC’s ‘This Week’ Pelosi told host George Stephanopoulos that “this president is impeached for life regardless of any gamesmanship on the part of Mitch McConnell.” While Congress passed articles of impeachment against the president he still technically needs to go through a trial in the Senate to determine his guilt. One is not “impeached” until a decision is made through a trial. Congress merely conducted an inquiry into accusations that Trump tried pressuring Ukraine into investigating political rival Joe Biden in exchange for foreign aid. His guilt or innocence would not be officially determined until the Senate votes and with Republicans holding a majority there and the case against the president flimsy at best it’s highly unlikely he will actually get impeached. A Senate trial is expected to begin within the next few weeks.  Claiming victory on impeachment was not the only odd statement from Pelosi in her Sunday interview. She also at one point claimed Democrats are “in court” fighting to get Ukraine-specific witnesses to comply with subpoenas put out by Congress. The administration had previously told officials not to comply with the investigation. “We are in court on the witnesses. It could take a very long time” Pelosi said after Stephanopoulos played a clip of Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins questioning Democrats not legally pursuing compliance with their subpoenas.  People to defy congressional subpoenas from the House include Rudy Giuliani one of Trump’s personal lawyers and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. Such a crime can land a person in jail for a year and slapped with a $100000 fine but no one has been sweating the consequences too much. When asked about the House potentially taking him to court over defying a subpoena Giuliani simply said “we will see what happens.” It’s unclear what Pelosi means by being “in court” anyway since no Ukraine-specific witnesses have been pursued in court.  The only cases being pursued by Democrats in court are related to grand jury material from Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian collusion in the 2016 presidential election and a motion to force Don McGahn to testify about accusations of obstruction of justice related to that same investigation. Again neither of these two cases have anything to do with the Ukraine investigation. Despite Pelosi’s dubious comments Trump critics still took to Twitter to celebrate her “impeached for life” claim and even got the phrase trending. Think your friends would be interested?

424,None,The proposal to legalize sex work is sponsored by four female lawmakers and is currently pending in the House Judiciary Committee. Rep. Selene Colburn a cosponsor of the bill and a member of the Progressive Party said decriminalizing sex work would improve the health and safety of prostitutes.  She added that prostitutes should feel they have the “protection of the police if they need it.” Other sponsors of the bill are Diana Wolnooski Maxine Grad and Emilie Kornheiser.  Nevada is currently the only jurisdiction in the United States to allow some prostitution. There are active brothels in seven counties in the state. There is a growing push from left-wing liberals and more Libertarian-minded conservatives to legalize sex work in more jurisdictions. Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders who is a senator from Vermont said last summer that he would be open to decriminalizing prostitution. The Libertarian Party has also endorsed decriminalizing sex work but their 2016 candidate Gary Johnson received less than four percent of the popular vote in the election so one could argue that the ideas of the party are not exactly mainstream. There was even a bill introduced to decriminalize prostitution in Washington DC last year. In a fierce debate more than 100 people testified for and against it. The DC Council Committee ultimately did not vote on the bill. Some argue that decriminalizing prostitution will increase the demand for sex workers which will increase the demand for human trafficking a point made in a Harvard Law and International Development report. Colburn and others believe though that by decriminalizing the act the government is not driving sex workers “underground” and they would essentially be ending black markets and giving protections to those who take part in the exchange. Social conservatives however remain staunchly against the idea of legalizing sex work accusing the ‘pimp lobby’ of seeking to increase their profits from the sex trade rather than caring for anyone’s safety or wellbeing.

430,None,In a lawsuit filed to the Bombay High Court and cited by local media make-up artist Srikant Sabnis 40 alleges that his biological mother willfully abandoned him when he was just two years old. Sabnis claims that in September 1981 his mother Aarti Mhaskar left his hometown of Pune for Mumbai to seek a job in the film industry. According to the plaintiff the woman left her infant son on the train once they arrived in the city. The boy was found by a railway officer and was sent to an orphanage the lawsuit says after which he was forced “to live like a beggar” until his grandmother obtained custody over him. The plaintiff allegedly did not learn the identity of his mother until 2017 and met her a year later. According to the lawsuit the woman admitted to leaving Sabnis nearly four decades ago due to “unavoidable circumstances” but she and her current husband asked him not to reveal who he really is in front of their other children. Having already suffered a “dreadful” life because of his abandonment at an early age Sabnis was “totally devastated by this unacceptable condition” the lawsuit says. He now wants Mhaskar to officially recognize him as her son and seeks 15 million rupees (US$212000) in compensation for moral damages. “The plaintiff has undergone a life full of agony mental trauma inconvenience mystery about his own parents and his existence” the lawsuit says.

431,None,Authorities say it could occur “within hours or days.” The volcano located some 70km (44 miles) south of the capital Manila spewed lava early on Monday. There was a brief respite from activity immediately after the lava release but Taal continued erupting later in the day. Sporadic “lava fountaining” and releases of steam continued throughout Monday the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) said. The volcano has also opened a handful of new lateral vents in the northern part of its main crater. The Taal’s first eruption in decades began on Sunday when the volcano produced a large column of steam followed by massive ash emissions. The eruption created a menacing-looking cloud of ash which has been repeatedly hit by volcanic lightning.  The eruption caused a massive ash fall which affected the areas lying primarily to the north of the volcano. The ash cloud caused a temporary shutdown of Manila’s international airport and cancellation of at least 240 domestic and international flights. The ashfall also prompted the closure of schools and businesses on Monday while citizens were urged to stay at home and wear masks and dust goggles if going outside was a must. In some areas the ash fall was followed by rain which turned the ash into thick mud hampering relief and evacuation efforts. So far about 8000 people have been evacuated from the communities in the immediate vicinity. While most of the initial ash has largely settled the ongoing eruptions continue to produce new emissions. The ash however appeared to be heading in a new direction on Monday and heavy ash fall has been reported to the southwest of the volcano. The alert level raised by the PHIVOLCS several times throughout Sunday remains at level four – out of a possible five. The eruption also prompted a tsunami alert which also remains in place. The volcano is located in the middle of its namesake lake and shore communities have been warned about the potential emergence of hazardous waves due to volcanic tremors. The Taal might not look very imposing – it’s one of the world’s smallest volcanoes – but it is one of the so-called Decade Volcanoes. There are only 16 such volcanoes around the globe boasting such a designation meaning they are known for violent and deadly eruptions and are therefore worthy of close monitoring and study. The last major eruption of the Taal Volcano occurred in 1977 while the deadliest one recorded happened in 1911 killing over 1300 people and destroying all the settlements on the island.

432,None,"“Hands and tongues smeared with threatening sanctioning and terrorizing the #Iranian nation are not entitled to dishonor the ancient #Persian language” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Abbas Mousavi tweeted on Monday. Mousavi was responding to Trump´s tweet in Persian Iran's official language which is also known as Farsi. The US leader backed the anti-government protests in the Islamic Republic and promised to ""continue to stand"" with the Iranian people. On January 3 a US drone strike in Iraq killed high-ranking Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani who Washington accused of plotting terrorist attacks. Soleimani's funeral procession drew massive crowds in several cities across Iran and was attended by over a million mourners in Tehran alone.  Trump also Farsi to call on the Iranian government “not to kill protesters” and express that it’s “totally up to” Iran to start negotiations as he “couldn’t care less.”  Iranian government spokesperson Ali Rabiei said that Iranians “saw how Trump was shedding crocodile tears” as he claimed to stand by them. Rabiei recalled that Trump had threatened to bomb sites which are important to “Iranian culture” after the “assassination of the country’s most popular commander.” The official also noted that Trump slapped Tehran with sweeping sanctions which are the “root cause” of the economic problems that Iranians are facing today including food and drug shortages. The protesters meanwhile are denouncing the Iranian authorities after they admitted to having mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian passenger airliner amid the dramatic flare-up of tensions with the US.

433,None,An explosive charge was reportedly placed on the gate outside a property in the area at roughly 1am local time in the Östermalm area. The blast which completely destroyed one vehicle damaged several others and blew the windows out of apartments along the entire street could be heard several kilometers away. No one was injured in the incident but 30 residents were evacuated immediately as a precaution and spent the night at emergency accommodation in a local school.  “We believe that the explosion happened in or at the building but exactly where is still unclear. There are damaged cars nearby but the explosion probably didn’t happen in them” Stockholm police spokesperson Mats Eriksson said Monday. A staircase was reportedly severely damaged which may have prompted the ongoing evacuation. In addition a door was blown to the opposite side of the street by the sheer force of the explosion which also took out a large section of an apartment balcony.  The Swedish bomb squad was also deployed to the scene to begin their investigations into the circumstances of the explosion. However just two hours after the Stockholm blast there was another suspicious explosion reported in the university town of Uppsala roughly an hour away. Again one building and several vehicles were damaged in the explosion but there were no reports of any injuries. Police have not indicated whether the explosions were connected.  Sweden’s authorities are struggling to curb a spate of bombings which has swept the country in recent months despite the establishment of a specialized task force.

434,None,The revelation was made by the king during an exclusive interview with France 24 which aired on Monday. The monarch said that his “major concern is that we have seen over the past year the re-establishment and rise of ISIS not only in southern eastern Syria but also in western Iraq.” Ironically the timeframe given by King Abdullah corresponds with the announcement of a decisive victory over IS by US President Donald Trump who repeatedly praised himself for the achievement in early 2019. After said ‘victory’ however the terrorist group is apparently on the rise again. Moreover thousands of fighters have moved from Syria into another of the region’s terrorist hotspots the king stated implying they were able to travel there through Turkey. Such a flow of extremists brings the whole Middle Eastern mess significantly closer to the EU – and the bloc must deal with it as soon as possible. The interview comes ahead of King Abdullah’s EU tour with the monarch scheduled to engage in talks in Brussels Strasbourg and Paris later this week. The situation in Libya – and the inflow of terrorists the war-torn country endures – will be among the main topics of discussion with the European leaders. “From a European perspective with Libya being much closer to Europe this is going to be an important discussion in the next couple of days” Abdullah said.

435,None,Writing in his local newspaper Sir Desmond Swayne the Conservative MP for New Forest West suggested that food banks were an “important contribution” to the welfare system but checks on how families spend their benefits were required. Swayne 63 then claimed that one in five children in Britain is “obese” by the time they leave primary school with those from the “lowest household incomes” being disproportionately affected.  The remarks have provoked anger online with many on Twitter suggesting that Swayne maybe should have taken a look around his own Tory benches before commenting. One person remarked: “Wow ... has he seen our PM? Not exactly the poster-boy for lean healthy living!” While another tweeted: “This is absolutely disgraceful.” Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner who is running to become the party’s next deputy leader hit out at the UK lawmaker. She insisted that the last thing poor people need is “finger wagging” and “derogatory insults” from a Tory MP. Another person seemingly frustrated by Swayne’s claims said: “Why do the rich always think they can tell the poor how to behave.”  Swayne caused controversy in October after a photo emerged of him ‘blacked up’ at a party when dressed as the legendary soul singer James Brown. He insisted that it was “fun” to do and refused to apologize maintaining that the only reason he wouldn’t do it again was because it was hard to wash off. Think your friends would be interested?

The slogan has been frequently used by anti-government demonstrators in Hong Kong in protests which started in March 2019. Copenhagen Police have cordoned off the sculpture and an investigation into the graffiti is underway with officers checking CCTV footage for any suspects and bringing in trained dogs to help search for materials that might have been used by the arsonists. The 107-year-old bronze statue is an enormous tourist draw but is clearly not universally popular suffering several arson attacks over the years. The mermaid has lost its head twice and an arm once.

440,None,In the ongoing diplomatic spat London summoned Ambassador Hamid Baeidinejad in an apparent tit-for-tat move. UK envoy Rob Macaire was summoned to the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday over his “unconventional behavior.” “This was an unacceptable breach of the Vienna Convention and it needs to be investigated” the Foreign Office said on Monday. “We are seeking full assurances from the Iranian government that this will never happen again.” The scandal broke out after the brief detention of Macaire on Saturday during a vigil for victims of the Ukrainian plane downing which turned into a large protest. Iran’s deputy FM Seyed Abbas Araghchi said the detention came as a “big surprise” for him and that the envoy was released immediately after his identity was confirmed. The UK envoy however received objections from the Iranian authorities over his participation in the rally while local media reports indicate he was believed to have actually been directing the protesters. Macaire denied the allegations insisting that he was only seeking to attend the vigil to pay his respects to the victims of the Ukrainian jet tragedy and only spent a few minutes there. The plane was shot down by Iranian anti-aircraft defenses last Wednesday after it was erroneously identified as an incoming cruise missile. Think your friends would be interested?

441,None,In an interview with LBC radio on Monday Patel accepted that the environmental group was not a terrorist organization but the decision to put XR on the UK terror list was made “in terms of risk to the public security risks security threats.” XR came to prominence in 2019 after staging protests which caused chaos in a number of cities as members of the group blocked streets calling for action to tackle climate change. The group was included in a guide titled: ‘Safeguarding Young People and Adults from Ideological Extremism.’ The document marked “official” was produced by counter-terrorism police. Patel’s comments drew an angry response from Labour leadership hopeful Rebecca Long-Bailey on Twitter who said the home secretary’s “defence of listing XR alongside neo-nazi terrorists is a disgrace.” XR staged mass demonstrations and a number of controversial stunts in London during April and October this year. In total around 3000 protesters were arrested. The group’s protests throughout autumn caused major travel disruptions in the UK capital. Public opinion towards the group soured when members staged a demonstration at a London Tube station climbing on top of train carriages until angry commuters pulled them back to the ground allowing services to resume.

444,None,Following the LHC ruling the ex-president is now a “free man” Ishtiaq A. Khan Additional Attorney General of Pakistan who represented the government in the case told AFP. The whole process against Musharraf – including the creation of a special court – was deemed to be void. LHC “has declared everything from the initiation of the complaint and its conclusion unconstitutional” Khan said as cited by Reuters. Earlier in the day Musharraf’s lawyer Azhar Siddique told the media outside the court that the judges have “nullified everything” against his client. Musharraf was sentenced to death in absentia on charges of high treason and undermining the constitution by the now-void special court in December last year. The verdict received a mixed reaction with Pakistan’s top military and government figures harshly criticizing the decision. A provision to hang Musharraf’s body in front of parliament for three days should he perish before the death sentence could be carried out was included in the verdict by one of the judges and sparked a backlash. It was branded “unprecedented and despicable” by Law Minister Farogh Naseem who called for the “mentally unfit” judge to be ousted. A controversial figure in Pakistan Musharraf was a general and army chief when he seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999. The accusations of treason against him date back to 2007 when he imposed a state of emergency as he sought reelection as president. Critics say Musharraf’s leadership was a setback for Pakistan. They accuse him of opening the country up to the CIA and its anti-terrorism program of targeted drone killings. They also believe he was linked to the assassination of his political opponent Benazir Bhutto in 2007. He has always firmly denied the allegation. His supporters however believe he is a true patriot who stood up to Islamist militants and staunchly defended Islamabad’s interests both at home and internationally.

445,None,The years-long chaos in Libya “didn’t give much room for optimism” so “a month or two ago no one had thought that the leaders of the two main warring factions would arrive in Moscow and sit down to negotiate” President of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vitaly Naumkin told RT. Fayez al-Sarraj the head of Libya’s Tripoli-based UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) and his rival the Libyan National Army (LNA) commander Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar arrived for peace talks in Moscow on Monday. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov are intermediaries in the discussions. Grigory Lukyanov a senior lecturer at the Moscow-based Higher School of Economics stressed that Russia’s unique role as “an independent neutral mediator” provides a chance to actually bring the conflicting parties together after all previous formats failed to do so. Haftar for one thing agreed to fly to Moscow because he does not consider Turkey an impartial side in the conflict Lukyanov told RT. The researcher noted that Russia’s primary goals are to end the bloodshed in Libya and lay the groundwork for further dialogue.   “The main task right now is to convince the parties that dialogue is better than war” he said adding that Turkey prefers a peace process to be created for Libya that would be similar to the existing Astana talks for Syria.    Naumkin agreed that a “lasting ceasefire” would be the most tangible result coming out of the talks. Libya has been devastated by war since 2011 when its longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed during a NATO-led bombing campaign. “NATO had never intended to bring democracy to Libya” Naumkin said. Remembering that the military bloc’s mission focused on getting rid of Gaddafi which ultimately led to the collapse of state institutions he added: “Democracy can never be introduced at the point of bayonets.” Lukyanov noted that it was “difficult to expect” that well-functioning democratic institutions could emerge after intervention from abroad. Russia warned about this back in 2011 and continues to do so today he said adding that the current “crisis was triggered by the ill-conceived destructive actions of the US and its allies such as France.” Think your friends would be interested?

448,None,The draft document suggests that all parties would stop military actions and observe the ceasefire conditions. Meanwhile a commission is to be established to determine a contact line between the warring sides. Russia and Turkey promised to support all sides in the conflict to help them implement the agreement. The talks in Moscow which involved the leaders of the major Libyan warring parties as well as foreign and defense ministers from both Russia and Turkey lasted for more than six hours and were mostly focused on detailing the terms of the ceasefire regime. Libya has been plunged into chaos for years after its longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed during a NATO-led bombing campaign. Following the years of devastation and chaos the country became engulfed in a civil war. Previous lengthy UN-backed talks on reconciliation which led to the establishment of the GNA eventually failed to bring peace to the war-ravaged land.   Haftar began an offensive against Tripoli last year and over the last few months the two sides were engaged in intense fighting.

450,None,The Libyan National Army (LNA) and the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) have agreed upon some ceasefire details but they are still working on a document to elaborate upon some aspects of the ceasefire deal. Some warring parties signed the agreement immediately but General Khalifa Haftar the LNA commander wanted to wait until Tuesday morning to have more time to study the document. The talks in Moscow which involved the leaders of the major Libyan warring parties as well as foreign and defense ministers of both Russia and Turkey lasted for more than six hours and were mostly focused on detailing the terms of the ceasefire regime. The draft document suggests that the hostilities would stop and all parties would observe the ceasefire without any preconditions. A commission is also to be established to determine the contact line between the GNA and the LNA. Lavrov also made it clear that Russia and Turkey would further lend their support to all Libyan parties to help them implement the agreement reached in Moscow. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also expressed hope that both sides would eventually commit to complying with the newly-reached agreement paving the way for the start of political process in Libya. According to Lavrov the agreement was signed by Fayez al-Sarraj the head of the UN-backed Tripoli-based Government of National Accord and Khalid al-Mishri the head of the High Council of State an advisory body formed after the UN-backed 2015 talks which is technically able to advise both the GNA and the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR) aligned with Haftar’s LNA. Aguila Saleh the head of HoR did not sign the document. However Lavrov hopes the group will sign it on Tuesday. Both leaders “view this document positively and just want some extra time until tomorrow morning to make a final decision about signing it” the Russian minister told journalists. “I hope this decision will be positive” he added. Libya was devastated after its long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed during a NATO-led bombing campaign. The country was plunged into chaos in the years that followed and eventually centers of power emerged in Tripoli and Tobruk – engulfing the nation in another civil war. Previous UN-backed attempts to bring reconciliation to Libya eventually failed. Last year Haftar – whose forces controlled most of the war-ravaged country – began his offensive against the internationally recognized GNA. Turkey got involved in the conflict in December promising to send troops to aid GNA. Moscow and Ankara called for all parties in the Libyan civil war to end hostilities and join a ceasefire following a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul. The ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia and Turkey is seen as a huge breakthrough in the peace process for the war-torn country. A Libya summit is expected to take place in Berlin on Sunday.

Independent Vermont Senator Sanders is running for president as a Democrat and has promised to back the Democratic nominee should he fail to secure the top prize. But that’s cold comfort to the party elite who are beginning to worry after a poll published on Monday showed the unabashed leftist in first place in Iowa with less than a month to go before that state holds its influential caucus. Nor is that the only state Sanders appears poised to win. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren – who has tried to position her campaign as a more moderate pragmatic version of Sanders’ progressive platform – has charged to the party’s rescue latching onto a fundraising script allegedly used by the Sanders campaign that described her supporters as “highly educated more affluent people.” Portraying her constituents thus equates to “trashing her” she told reporters when confronted with the script on Sunday. Warren then went on to use it as the basis of a fundraising email pleading for “unity.” While Warren condemned Sanders for injecting “factionalism” into the contest statistics don’t lie – she is more popular among the “educated and rich” while Sanders enjoys more support among poorer voters and those without a college education. Only in the rarefied climate of the Democratic primary would “educated and rich” even be considered an insult - the fundraising email sent by a campaign staffer for Harvard professor Warren even insisted that the phrase “doesn’t describe me or many of the passionate volunteers and organizers I know.” But 2020 is not a normal election and after the ‘catastrophe’ of 2016 the Democrats are not a normal party. The centrist faction that triumphed over Sanders to run (and lose) with Hillary Clinton is locked in a battle with the leftist faction he represents – a mostly younger and scrappier group determined not to let ‘electability’ trump principles this time around. Sanders responded to Warren’s “disappointment” by claiming he’d never personally said anything negative against her explaining that with “hundreds of employees… people sometimes say things they shouldn’t.” A Sanders volunteer even hinted at a conspiracy to smear the campaign suggesting “anyone” could dump a negative script into the chat volunteers used. #ITrustBernie was trending on Monday as Sanders fans pledged their support after Warren's attack. Sanders’ ‘small-s’ socialism has won him enormous popular support. He broke Democratic fourth-quarter fundraising records earlier this month and has so far raised over $96 million in small donations eschewing the large corporate donors he has said he wants out of electoral politics altogether. His (in)famous claim that “billionaires should not exist” and plans to redistribute their wealth have ruffled some influential feathers in a party kept afloat by billionaires however and the establishment media has redoubled its own attacks as Sanders surges in the polls. The New York Times published a lengthy interview with the candidate on Monday framing the piece by reminding the reader of his recent heart attack and his support for leftist political movements “plagued” with “corruption and even violence.” Peppered throughout Sanders’ responses are links contradicting his claims even “fact-checking” his reference to having been interviewed by the Times before (“All but three members of the current editorial board joined after Mr. Sanders’s endorsement interview in 2015” it sniffs). The outlet hints that he is on the payroll of Big Vape (“campaign finance reports reveal that the Sanders campaign has accepted donations from Juul Labs employees”) attempts to frame his observation that exploitation of migrant workers drives wages down as anti-immigrant rhetoric and makes much of his unfamiliarity with social media and smartphone apps (because he’s old get it?!). But current polling puts Sanders ahead of Trump in an electoral face-off - only Biden can say the same and his numbers have been sliding so fast the political establishment has preemptively started blaming Russia. For once the Democratic Party may have to choose between the lesser of two evils.

453,None,"US President Donald Trump was impeached in the House of Representatives based on the narrative that he interfered in Ukrainian domestic affairs for personal political gain – but it was Biden himself who interfered while he was Barack Obama’s deputy according to ‘UkraineGate: Inconvenient Facts.’ The documentary was produced by French investigative journalist Olivier Berruyer founder of popular anti-corruption and economics blog Les Crises.  Biden publicly boasted about using US and international aid as leverage in 2015 to get prosecutor Viktor Shokin fired and replaced by Yuriy Lutsenko who was an interior minister in 2005-2006 but was later convicted by a Ukrainian court for corruption. After the 2014 Euromaidan coup the sentence was quashed. Those interviewed in Berruyer’s film describe Lutsenko as a “crook” who was “abusing his office” a man who “does not have any moral values and principles” and who had done “nothing” to fight corruption while in his post. ""Our investigation and its many powerful testimonies prove that Joe Biden lied brazenly and misled many people"" when he claimed Shokin's replacement was “someone solid” says Berruyer.

454,None,The Libyan National Army (LNA) and the UN-backed Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) have joined a ceasefire suggested by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as the leaders of the two warring factions arrived in Moscow for talks aimed at brokering a lasting truce. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov acted as intermediaries in negotiations between the LNA commander Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and the GNA head Fayez al-Sarraj. The negotiations ended with al-Sarraj and his allies signing the deal and Haftar asking for some time. The draft document suggests that the hostilities would stop and all parties would observe the ceasefire without any preconditions. A commission is also to be established to determine the contact line between the GNA force and the LNA. Even before the outcome of the talks was known the process received praise from some officials around the world. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the initiative of Russia and Turkey and praised the temporary truce as an important step but said that said that Libya needs a complex process of “consolidation” which according to her should be supervised by the UN. “A ceasefire yes it is a first step in the right direction but what you need is a process for consolidation for reconstruction and a government of unity. There is a long way to go. This has to be a UN-led process” she told reporters after a meeting with Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel. Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas also called the ceasefire “a positive signal” adding that his nation also plans to contribute to the political process in Libya by hosting a Libya summit later in January. “We currently have a good chance of making progress here” he said. African Union Commissioner for Peace and Security Smail Chergui emphasized Putin’s role in encouraging both warring parties to come to the negotiating table. “I welcome this step as well as the efforts taken by President Putin” he said adding that “signing a ceasefire agreement should be the first step to complying with the UN Security Council’s arms embargo and putting an end to any outside interference into Libya.” Libya was plunged into chaos for years after its longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed during a NATO-led bombing campaign. Following years of devastation and chaos the country got engulfed in a civil war. Previous lengthy UN-backed talks on reconciliation which led to the establishment of the GNA failed to bring peace to the war-ravaged land. Like this story?

455,None,Indian film actor director and producer Ajay Devgn’s ‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior’ and Indian superstar actress and producer Deepika Padukone’s ‘Splash’ are very different movies in ways that extend far beyond storyline or budget. They appear to have divided audiences along ideological lines ever since they hit cinemas together on January 10. The intense rivalry over the two films can be gauged by the fact that workers for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party are distributing free tickets for ‘Tanhaji’ – based on the legend of a Hindu warrior from the medieval era – in many places while Congressmen members of the main opposition party in India are doing so for ‘Splash’ a biopic about acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal. Several BJP leaders have called for a boycott of ‘Splash’ but in the Congress-ruled states of Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan the movie has been declared tax-free in a bid to boost its prospects. Box-office figures for the two movies have only served to further intensify their fight. ‘Tanhaji’ has been met with a tremendous response bringing in Rs 61.75 crore (US$8.7 million) at ticket windows over its opening weekend; in contrast takings for ‘Splash’ were much lower totaling Rs 19.02 crore ($US2.6 million) in the same period. It may not be a battle of equals. ‘Tanhaji’ is an extravagant period drama depicting the exploits of Tanaji Malusare a 17th-century Maratha military leader from Maharashtra who took on the mighty Mughals during the reign of Muslim emperor Aurangzeb. ‘Splash’ on the other hand is a low-budget film tackling the rampant issue of acid attacks on girls across India which seeks to deliver a strong social message. Despite their vast differences the two movies are locked in an epic clash – primarily because of Padukone’s visit to Jawaharlal Nehru University two days before the release of her movie apparently to express solidarity with agitating students who had earlier been beaten by the police. The university campus has long been a hotbed of left-wing politics with students having protested for quite some time against the policies of the Modi government including the recent amendment to the citizenship laws and the hikes in various university fees. Padukone’s visit therefore raised the hackles of Modi supporters who not only accused the 34-year-old actress of resorting to a cheap publicity stunt to boost her film’s prospects but also called for its boycott due to her support for the allegedly divisive elements on the JNU campus. Unsurprisingly the actress was on the receiving end of their barbs once it became clear on Monday that her film had fared poorly compared to ‘Tanhaji’. Padukone’s baiters claim that audiences have summarily rejected her film while extending wholehearted support to ‘Tanhaji’ because the Devgn-starrer containing themes of nationalism reflects the overall national mood against divisive forces in the country. They also construe its success as a validation of the Modi government’s policies underpinned by a sense of national pride and patriotism. “It is no longer #Tanhaji vs #Chhapaak (‘Splash’ - RT.) at the BO it’s about those For India vs Against India. I hope the message is loud and clear” tweeted Gunjan Mehta apparently a supporter of the government. Others dubbed ‘Splash’ a commercial disaster claiming only three people had gone to watch it in a theatre in the eastern city of Patna on the day of release. Film analysts believe that the success of ‘Tanhaji’ which is set to be the first movie of the year to net Rs 100 crore ($US14 million) – a benchmark for any blockbuster in India – points to a growing preference among audiences for nationalistic films. They cite the massive success of 2018’s ‘Uri’ starring Vicky Kaushal which was based on India’s surgical strikes on the terror camps of Balakot in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in 2016. ‘Tanhaji’ director Om Raut also feels that the general atmosphere in the country today is one of pride and patriotism. ”The environment is of a very strong feeling of being an Indian of patriotism” he says. “The entire environment is such. Cinema and filmmakers are only a reflection and part of society.” Nonetheless ‘Splash’ has not turned out to be a damp squib after all. Trade experts say that although it may have done less business than ‘Tanhaji’ it is a smaller movie by comparison. ‘Splash’ has been made on a tight budget they note with both Padukone and director Meghna Gulzar also adopting the role of co-producers. Since it does not contain any big stars other than Padukone herself it is likely not only to recover its costs but also to make a profit towards the end of its first week in cinemas. It is altogether a different matter that ‘Tanhaji’ a veritable ode to Hindu valor and pride will have become a blockbuster by then – and that will be a cause for celebration for Modi supporters in and outside of the Indian film industry.

456,None,The shooting was an “act of terror” that was “motivated by jihadist ideology” Barr told reporters on Monday at a press conference adding that Alshamrani is believed to have acted alone. Alshamrani visited the 9/11 memorial during the Thanksgiving holiday after posting a cryptic message on September 11 stating that the “countdown” had begun Barr revealed. Following an exhaustive investigation the US will return 21 Saudi military students to their home country later on Monday. After the probe turned up “derogatory material” on the 21 cadets’ computers in addition to “jihadi or anti-American content” on 17 of them and “some kind of contact with child pornography” on 15 the Saudi government “determined that this material demonstrated conduct unbecoming an officer in the Royal Saudi Air Force and in the Royal Navy.” However none of the material would result in criminal prosecution on its own under US law Barr clarified. Barr praised the actions of two US Marines who attempted to stop Alshamrani as well as a navy airman shot five times by the gunman who helped others escape the hail of bullets and the Saudi government which gave “complete and total support” to the investigation. While Alshamrani was not inspired by or working with any particular group his social media posts showed he harbored “anti-US military and anti-Israel sentiment” and believed “violence was necessary to defend Muslim countries” deputy FBI director David Bowdich told reporters. Some of his statements echoed those of Anwar al-Awlaki an American cleric killed in a drone strike in Yemen he added. Barr took time to excoriate Apple for refusing to unlock the shooter’s phones despite a court order returning to an anti-encryption theme that has frequently surfaced in the AG’s public statements. Alshamrani a second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force killed three people and wounded eight at the naval base before he was himself killed in a shootout with Escambia County Sheriff’s deputies on December 6. Barr dispelled early reports that Alshamrani had arrived at the base with colleagues who filmed the violence. The US trains Saudi military students on American soil with some 850 personnel reported to be in the country when the Pensacola shooting resulted in a temporary suspension of their military training. The tragedy has elicited a call for stricter vetting of all foreign military personnel who receive permission to train in the US from Pentagon chief Mark Esper. Like this story?

457,None,"      Little Women: This drama follows the story of four women dealing with life during the Civil War.  Nominations: Six including including Best Actress (Saoirse Ronan) and Best Supporting Actress (Florence Pugh). Good or woke: The film has earned some backlash for containing uncharacteristically modern liberal speeches. The moments include characters being ashamed of America and explaining why marriage is bad for women. The speeches are sprinkled throughout the movie and make the proceedings feel odd and disjointed. It’s yet another Hollywood feature that suffers from too much focus on modern agendas and not enough focus on story. Though the film was nominated for Best Picture and several other awards producer Amy Pascal has said men’s “unconscious bias” has led to awards snubs at several ceremonies.  Rating: Woke The Irishman: Martin Scorsese’s film joined the talents of Robert De Niro Al Pacino and Joe Pesci – all staples of gangster cinema classics – for the first time. It follows the story of Jimmy Hoffa’s (Pacino) – an uncharacteristically popular labor union leader with mob connections who mysteriously disappeared in 1975 – rise and fall through the eyes of a gangster and pal (De Niro). Nominations: Nine including Best Picture Director and Supporting Actor (both Pacino and Pesci).  Good or woke: The de-aging of the actors was atrocious and an actual story doesn’t really kick in until the film’s last hour or so. Producers behind the movie tried to win over politically correct social media mobs before the flick’s release by talking up the story’s supposed takedown of “toxic masculinity."" It’s easy to see how the makers filtered this move through a “toxic masculinity” lens. They seem so afraid to give any energy to their characters. While Scorsese’s ‘Goodfellas’ and ‘Casino’ were fun and vibrant ‘The Irishman’ ended up being a tepid and lifeless look at gangster life and all it has to offer. Rating: Woke Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: An aging actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stuntman (Brad Pitt) attempt a comeback in the movie business in 1969 Los Angeles.  Nominations: Nine including Best Picture Director Actor (DiCaprio) and Supporting Actor (Pitt) Good or woke: ‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’ got away with quite a lot for being released in 2019. The film included extreme violence Brad Pitt beating up hippies and plenty of right-leaning talking points from its main characters. It got away with so much because the new strategy for being politically incorrect without angering anyone is simply setting your story in the past. That way you can hide behind excuses like “it was a different time” or “of course these characters are mean but they didn’t know any better.” Past or no past we should still be grateful a movie as unforgivably free-wheeling in its dialogue and action like this was released in a year where wokeness in movies was dialed up to 11. Rating: Good especially when Pitt beats up those hippies Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The concluding chapter to the rebooted saga based on George Lucas’ original films. Nominations: Three including Best Visual Effects and Original Score. Good or woke: From the Mary Sue main character in Rey to the lame “hate the rich” speeches in ‘Last Jedi’ to the overall muddy storytelling that makes Lucas’s prequel trilogy look like a masterpiece we should all be grateful this trilogy has come to a conclusion.  Yes it’s more diverse than the other ‘Star Wars’ chapters but that does not suddenly make this good storytelling.  Rating: The wokest of the woke Parasite: An unemployed family takes various jobs working for a wealthy family who may have a few twisted secrets.  Nominations: Eight including Best Picture and Director.  Good or woke: ‘Parasite’ is an incredibly well-made film. It’s beautifully shot and expertly builds tension until its final moments – but it’s also woke woke woke.  The film’s intention in contrasting the families is clear from the beginning. One scene even shows how the two families deal with the same rain storm. The rich family look out their window and simply enjoys a rainy night in their cozy abode while the poor family who quite literally live miles below fight for their lives as they battle incoming water.  Rating: Super woke but super good 1917: Two British soldiers in World War I are tasked with moving through enemy lines to warn 1600 soldiers that they are walking into a trap. Nominations: Eight including Best Picture and Director Good or woke: ‘1917’ was this year’s gimmick movie but luckily the gimmick worked. The World War I feature was filmed to look as though everything happens in one take and it really adds to the rising tension of the film. The Sam Mendes-directed movie spends so much time wrapped up in telling its story that it doesn’t have a whole lot of time to push an agenda. Just pure filmmaking here. Rating: Good Bombshell: Three blonde “bombshells” (Charlize Theron Margot Robbie Naomie Watts) work at Fox News and face sexual harassment at the hands of the late Roger Ailes (John Lithgow). Nominations: Three including Best Actress (Theron) and Supporting Actress (Robbie). Good or woke: It’s a story worth telling considering Ailes had some very real and harsh accusations lodged against him toward the end of his life but told through the filter of liberal Hollywood ‘Bombshell’ is an insufferably one-sided affair. According to this flick Fox News is the only place where these sorts of things were happening which anyone with an internet connection knows is far far from the truth. It also goes out of its way to make its main characters including former Fox News host Megyn Kelly (Theron) look bad. It’s afraid to humanize conservative women. Rating: Woke Ford v Ferrari: Matt Damon and Christian Bale star as Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles two racing legends tasked with helping Ford take the Le Mans racing title from Ferrari. Nominations: Four including Best Picture and Editing. Good or woke: It was a bit of a shock to see ‘Ford v Ferrari’ earn a Best Picture nomination considering how little the film caters to modern cultural standards. The James Mangold-directed feature looks lovingly at men and ambition two things almost never shown in a good light in modern Hollywood. It’s an old school tale of hard work passion and competition bringing out the very best in men who dedicate their lives to doing what they love.  Rating: Good Marriage Story: This film quite simply tells the tale of a married couple (Scarlet Johansson and Adam Driver) going through the painful process of a divorce.  Nominations: Six including Best Actress (Johansson) and Actor (Driver). Good or woke: One could say Noah Baumbach’s ‘Marriage Story’ is a socially liberal anti-marriage film since it’s such a cynical and uncomfortable look at every step of a marriage falling apart but there’s really no agenda here besides giving an honest and uncomfortably real look at a relationship devolving. Rating: Good Jojo Rabbit: The satirical film follows the story of a young Nazi boy who worships Hitler but finds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl. Nominations: Six including Best Picture and Supporting Actress (Johansson) Good or woke: ‘Jojo Rabbit’ remains one of the most surprising movies of the year. At a time when people especially conservatives are accused of being “Nazis” on a daily basis it seemed unlikely that Hollywood would turn its attention to a Nazi comedy but that’s exactly what they did. What commences may make some uncomfortable but it is also surprisingly charming. Rating: Good Joker: This was the movie the mainstream media warned us would cause violence and panic in the streets. Todd Phillips’ slowburn look inside the mind of a man losing a grip with sanity ended up causing nothing but people to actually go to cinemas. The Popeye’s chicken sandwich inspired more violence than this flick. Nominations: 11 including Best Picture Director and Actor (Joaquin Phoenix). Good or woke: Despite tackling serious subjects like mental health and class division the film managed to not be a preachy diatribe. It was an actual story with a nuanced lead character and a layered message that doesn’t fully align with any political party.  ‘Joker’ may have been the hit the media and woke crowds didn’t want but people came out in droves for this flick. The $60 million film made a colossal billion dollars at the box office and is sure to change the landscape of comic book movies for years to come.  Any movie that can get praises from both Glenn Beck and Michael Moore can’t be all bad right? Rating: Not just good but great Zachary Leeman author of the novel Nigh and journalist who covers art and culture. ", https://www.rt.com/usa/478164-oscar-nominations-woke-good/,
458,None,Fayez al-Sarraj who heads the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli and Khalifa Haftar who commands the rival Libyan National Army (LNA) forces spent six hours in closed-door discussions mediated by Russia and Turkey. The meeting came as a bit of a surprise as Haftar previously snubbed the ceasefire suggested by Moscow and Ankara. By Monday evening Moscow time a draft agreement between Haftar and al-Sarraj said that both sides supported an “unconditional open-ended” ceasefire but only GNA representatives signed the deal while Haftar asked to have till Tuesday morning to consider the agreement which also called for a “military commission to determine a contact line” between the warring parties. Russian media reported that while the two men were in the same building al-Sarraj refused to engage in direct talks with Haftar.  While unsurprisingly no major breakthrough was made Monday the Moscow talks were an important step and were intended to pave the way for another summit to be held in Berlin later this month. A spokesperson for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday that the planned Berlin talks would be the start of a “longer process.” The Libya sit-down came as something of a surprise to many. “Few – particularly in Europe – saw this coming” tweeted Libya researcher and journalist Mary Fitzgerald. With Haftar's LNA looking poised to close in on Tripoli the situation in Libya had been left to fester and looked to be at a point of major escalation before the Russian and Turkish intervention. Russia was in the optimal position to host the talks Grigory Lukyanov a senior lecturer at the Moscow-based Higher School of Economics told RT. That is because Russia is “the only player today that has the trust” of both major factions in Libya as well as of Turkey and Egypt which back opposing sides in the conflict. Of course the big question now is whether any ceasefire can remain in place after the Moscow and Berlin talks Mark Almonddirector of the Crisis Research Institute Oxford (CRIOx) UK told RT. But even if the current fighting lines are frozen that “at least gives time and possibilities for further discussions.” It is unlikely that Haftar would travel to Moscow if he was unwilling to sign an agreement but he will have to ensure that all sub-groups and militias within the LNA are on board with the ceasefire Almond said. Libya has been in a state of chaos since NATO’s military operation nine years ago plunged the country into civil war and opened up a power vacuum which various warring factions have attempted to fill. Having created the crisis in the first place the West then stepped away from efforts to solve it and quarrelled with each other over the best approach. The European Union itself does not have one unified position on Libya. Italy was once seen as a major influence in Libya and now increasingly seen as less relevant to talks. French President Emmanuel Macron told Putin in a call on Monday that he would support any ceasefire that was “credible durable and verifiable.” “Now [Russia and Turkey] not only have their seat at the table they provide the table. And Europe is nowhere to be seen” tweeted Der Spiegel journalist Mathieu von Rohr. European and Arab powers “scrambled to catch up” as Putin used “the levers of diplomacy” to take the lead on Libya the Independent wrote.  The decision by Russia and Turkey to take the lead on Libya can be compared with how the pair also stepped up to take control of political negotiations in the Syrian conflict. Russia’s proactive role in Syria sparked a frenzy in the West with the media raising the alarm about Russian influence in the region and even portraying Russia’s efforts as sinister. Yet the results can sometimes speak for themselves. Al-Sarraj and Haftar’s willingness to travel to Moscow to begin fresh talks – something that a month ago seemed unimaginable – indicates that even the most complicated and multi-layered conflicts could be solved through diplomatic means rather than through threats and arm-twisting.

459,None,Grisham says Democrats are “taking the side of terrorists” and that was the point Trump was trying to make when he retweeted an image of Pelosi and Schumer photshopped with Muslim garb on in front of an Iranian flag. Fox News host Harris Faulker confronted Grisham about the tweet on Monday and even read a response that called the photoshopped image a “slur.” “Why the actual hell is the president of the United States using the way I and millions of other Americans dress and the religious beliefs that We hold as a slur. This absolutely must be condemned by congressional lawmakers on both sides of the aisle” read the tweet brought up by Faulkner which was originally posted by Libyan-American writer and commentator Hend Amry. “Why would the president take even the time to retweet something like this?” Faulker asked Grisham.  The press secretary went into a long-winded defense about the “point” the president was trying to make with the rather silly retweet. “I think the president is making clear that the Democrats have been parroting Iranian talking points and almost taking the side of terrorists and those who are out to kill the Americans” she said. “I think the president was making a point that the Democrats seem to hate him so much that they are willing to be on the side of countries and leadership of countries who want to kill Americans.” Grisham’s defense sparked almost as much outrage as the actual tweet from Trump with some going so far as to bring up Grisham’s criminal history and the fact that she has not held press briefings while she has been with the administration.  Like this story?

460,None,Bar associations in cities all over France have staged theatrical demonstrations to draw the public’s attention to the longest general strike in decades which has been underway since December 5. Videos posted on social media show the lawyers tossing off their robes carrying a “coffin of justice” spelling out “SOS” with law books and singing protest songs as they demand a retraction of the new pension system Macron’s government recently unveiled. The strike has disrupted some major trials including that of former priest Bernard Preynat - the worst clergy abuse case to reach French courts so far. Preynat is accused of sexually abusing 75 Boy Scouts; while he admitted to the abuse in the 1990s he was only defrocked in July after his superiors covered up for him. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted but the case is on hold due to the strike. The lawyers are just one of many professional groups that have stopped work to protest the proposed “one-size-fits-all” pension scheme. Under the current system different professions retire at different ages and receive different benefits complications Macron has complained is unfair and too expensive. As the strike edged into its sixth week the government offered to withdraw the most controversial proposal - raising the retirement age two years from 62 to 64 - but not all unions took the offer.  The general strike is the longest one for transit workers since the creation of France’s national rail service.Nurses teachers refinery workers and port workers have joined also in their opposition to the government. The Yellow Vests still protesting after more than a year have joined the strikers in solidarity at marches in the cities with the past weekend’s march reportedly drawing over 1.3 million across the country. The Yellow Vest protests were initially sparked by another of Macron’s austerity reforms a gas tax that was ultimately rescinded in the face of massive public opposition.  Like this story?

461,None,Actress Issa Rae who was helping to announce the Oscar nominations took a dig at the recognition of the nominees by saying after their names were announced: “congratulations to those men.”  There's little doubt that Quentin Tarantino Todd Phillips Martin Scorsese Bong Joon-ho and Sam Mendes created good films. But it was an especially odd year for no females to be nominated for the Best Director Award since there were so many critically acclaimed films directed by female artists including ‘Little Women’ from Greta Gerwig. Gerwig was arguably the biggest snub since her film earned nominations for Best Picture Best Adapted Screenplay Best Actress (Soairse Ronan) Best Supporting Actress (Florence Pugh) Best Original Score and Best Costume Design. With that many nominations it was a bit of a surprise to see Gerwig’s name not pop up as a nominee. Other women directors seen as snubbed include Lorene Scafaria for ‘Hustlers’ and Merielle Heller for ‘A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood’ a film which earned a Best Actor nomination for Tom Hanks. Kathryn Bigelow remains the only woman to win a Best Director Oscar in the 92 year history of the Academy Awards something some critics were quick to point out in light of the new nominees.  Bigelow won the award for 2009’s ‘The Hurt Locker.’ To make matters worse only five women total have been nominated in the Best Director category. Whether the male nominees were actually more worthy of their nominations than the acclaimed female directors of the year is also up for debate. Martin Scorsese was nominated for a movie — ‘The Irishman’ — that has special effects outshined by a YouTuber using free software and ‘Joker’ director Todd Phillips is earning plenty of criticism for being nominated for a film that is essentially one long homage to the work of Scorsese.  But still the choices seemed puzzling in the light of Hollywood's self-promoted woke image making the Academy Awards a prime example of why diverse industry is nothing but a mirage.  If you like this story share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/usa/478170-oscar-nominations-female-snubs/,
462,None,"The Treasury said in a statement that China agreed to publish relevant data on exchange rates and made an effort to refrain from ""competitive devaluation"" ahead of the agreement signing. In its semi-annual report released on Monday the Treasury said that while China “took concrete steps to devalue its currency” Beijing still needs “to take the necessary steps to avoid a persistently weak currency.”  The report explicitly credits the tentative phase one trade agreement between the US and China struck in December for helping to bring about the reforms. The report also notes an “extremely large and persistent trade surplus” Beijing enjoys with the US which it said is “dwarfing all other trade imbalances” between the US and other countries. The Treasury urged China to boost domestic demand and lessen its economy's reliance on export and investment apparently to reduce the trade gap. The US goods trade deficit with China stood at $401 billion as of June 2019 which accounts for about 45 percent of the total US trade deficit from January to June of last year the report states. While the Trump administration struck China off the roll of currency manipulators it has placed Beijing along with nine other countries on the Treasury’s ‘Monitoring List’ of major trading partners that “merit close attention to their currency practices.” The list includes staunch US allies such as Germany Korea and Japan. The move to yank China off the blacklist comes more than five months after it was formally designated a currency manipulator in August a decision that added more fuel to the smoldering tensions between Beijing and Washington which are locked in a bitter trade dispute. It comes just two days ahead of the much-anticipated signing of the phase one deal on Wednesday January 15 which is expected to mark a shaky truce after almost two years of a trade war in which China and the US have slapped tariffs on billions’ worth of each other’s goods.  Think your friends would be interested?

463,None,The case was filed with the US District Court in Massachusetts on Monday by Lawrence Lessig – a policy activist and founder of the Creative Commons project – who says the Times used a “clickbait” headline to misinform readers in an article published in September which led him to be unfairly “associated with the notoriety surrounding the Epstein scandal.” The paper’s actions “are part of a growing journalistic culture of clickbaiting: the use of a shocking headline... to entice readers to click on a particular article irrespective of the truth of the headline” Lessig’s lawsuit reads. The story in question is centered on an essay Lessig wrote in defense of Joi Ito the former director of MIT’s Media Lab who resigned in disgrace after it was discovered he had accepted and then covered up donations to MIT from Jeffrey Epstein. Lessig’s essay made the case that MIT had the right to keep its donors private and argued that while Ito made many mistakes he nonetheless tried to “to determine whether Epstein remained an abuser.” In covering the essay however the Times headlined its story: “A Harvard Professor Doubles Down: If You Take Epstein’s Money Do It in Secret” adding in its first paragraph that Lessig was defending “soliciting donations from the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.” The story alleges “the exact opposite of what Lessig had written” and was printed even after he brought his concerns to the newspaper pre-publication the lawsuit says. “My essay said – repeatedly – that such soliciting was a 'mistake'” Lessig wrote in a blog post on Monday discussing the suit adding “I did not defend taking money from Epstein. I didn’t say it was ok to take money from Epstein ‘if in secret.’” A spokesperson for the Times said the newspaper will “defend against the claim vigorously” in a statement to the Hill adding senior editors reviewed Lessig’s complaints and were “satisfied that the story accurately reflected his statements.” Like this story?

464,None,“Our principled position is clear-cut. We are against unilateral sanctions and the so-called ‘long-arm jurisdiction’” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said in a press briefing on Monday responding to a round of sanctions recently imposed on Iran’s metal exports sector three Chinese companies and a number of senior Iranian officials. Geng also urged the US to resolve differences “through dialogue” and in compliance with the UN Charter instead of through threats and ultimatums and said Washington must take “concrete steps” to ratchet down tensions with Iran. The new round of sanctions came days after Iran carried out missile strikes on US bases in Iraq launched in reprisal for the killing of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani who was assassinated by an American drone near Baghdad International Airport on January 3. Appearing on Fox News on Monday US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said American sanctions had so far cut off “over 95 percent of [Iran’s] oil revenues” adding that Beijing could face sanctions if it doesn’t halt its own petrol purchases from the Islamic Republic. While Beijing steadily decreased its oil purchases from Iran over 2019 it continues to be the top importer of Iranian crude and recently stepped up efforts to develop Iran’s energy resources as part of a “strategic partnership” deal signed last year namely by helping to boost output at the massive Azadegan oil field near the Iraqi border.

465,None,The US has upped the rhetorical ante on its largely unfounded claims that Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei will severely compromise a country’s cyber security if it is allowed to work on any of the world’s burgeoning national 5G networks. A team of high-ranking US officials including those from the National Security Agency (NSA) were set to present supposedly damning evidence to the UK government on Monday arguing the equipment supplied by the Chinese company may come with hidden ‘backdoors’ granting Beijing access to critical British infrastructure. In the wake of the meeting with the British ministers the Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh quoted US officials as saying that using Huawei technology for 5G in the UK would be “an act of madness.” It’s unclear exactly what proof the US officials presented to their British colleagues as several major US allies such as Germany and India have so far found no compelling reason to ban Huawei from their own 5G networks. Washington has long tried to persuade London into shunning the Chinese tech giant. In December US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien argued that once Huawei is given a green light in the UK Beijing would “steal wholesale state secrets whether they are the UK’s nuclear secrets or secrets from MI6 or MI5.”  Such an ominous prediction apparently did not strike a chord with the British intelligence community itself however with head of MI5 Andrew Parker telling the Financial Times in a recent interview that he had “no reason to think” the intelligence sharing agreement between the UK and the US would be in any danger if the British government refused to shut the door on Huawei.  Huawei has denied that it is in bed with the Chinese government and that its products can be used for spying in turn warning the UK that by caving in to American pressure it may see its own technological development fall behind on a “fabricated pretext.”  The UK is expected to make a formal decision on whether to allow Huawei to be a part of its next-generation networks later this month.

466,None,Barr told reporters on Monday that Apple had not “given any substantive assistance” to law enforcement agencies looking to crack into a pair of smartphones owned by the shooter – who left four people dead on a Florida naval base in December – but the company directly countered the AG in a statement. “We reject the characterization that Apple has not provided substantive assistance in the Pensacola investigation” the tech giant said adding that it had responded to the FBI’s requests for help “promptly often within hours.” Apple previously went head-to-head with the FBI in a lengthy legal battle over a similar phone-cracking case related to the 2016 terrorist attack in San Bernardino in which the company refused to provide the bureau a backdoor into one of the attacker’s phones. Though Apple still maintains “there is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys” the company has become more willing to engage with law enforcement in recent years announcing in 2018 that it would create a special police “portal” allowing officers to request data. Despite its attitude on encryption the company’s devices have also been found to contain inadvertent backdoors of a sort with fears of spying triggered last year after a curious microphone glitch popped up allowing callers to hear recipients speak before they answered the phone. Last August it was also revealed that company contractors were granted access to customers’ private conversations through Siri the AI assistant program a practice Apple says it has since ended. The company turned heads more recently when it confirmed that it scans all images stored in its cloud service for evidence of “child abuse” prompting some critics to slam the company for violating user privacy.

467,None,The world’s second richest person Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos should not count on a red carpet welcome in India when he arrives in New Delhi later this week with mass rallies and sit-ins being planned by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) protesting what it calls “predatory” trade practices. The CAIT which represents 70 million small traders and businesses has called on its supporters to go on strike on Wednesday when Bezos is set to touch down. The group argues that retail giants such as Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart have been engaging in predatory dumping pushing local merchants out of business. The CAIT accused Amazon of trying to spin its vulture capitalism as something that can empower small traders while peddling “a wrong and false narrative.” Branding both US-based companies “economic terrorists” that prey on India’s small businesses the CAIT asked for a meeting with PM Narendra Modi amid reports that Bezos has sought one himself. The association said its biggest rally would be held in front of Amazon India’s offices in Delhi where Bezos is set to attend an event for small and medium-sized businesses. Since late November supporters of CAIT and other trade organizations have hit the streets to voice their outrage over the two e-commerce giants’ alleged violation of competition laws. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) announced on Monday that it had opened an investigation into the alleged violations by both Amazon and Flipkart noting that “there exists a prima facie case which requires an investigation.” The complaint which spurred the probe alleges that the two companies promoted several “preferred sellers” that were in effect controlled by Amazon and Flipkart themselves. The CCI order also noted that the retailers have offered huge discounts and have played favorites with listings by particular sellers among other things. “Exclusive launch (of mobile phones) coupled with preferential treatment to a few sellers and the discounting practices create an ecosystem that may lead to an appreciable adverse effect on competition” said the 11-page order cited by Reuters. The CAIT hailed the decision to launch a probe calling it “historic.” Flipkart has brushed off the allegations while Amazon said it would “welcome” the opportunity to respond to the claims maintaining that it is “confident” it is not in the wrong.

468,None,Remarkable footage of the incident surfaced on social media showing the moment the ground gave way beneath the bus as it stopped to pick up passengers in the city of Xining sending it head-first into a large hole. At least one explosion can be seen inside the hole moments later. Rescue teams are now searching for the 10 passengers still missing and the cause of the accident is still under investigation according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. While uncommon sinkholes occur from time to time in China with one 60-meter hole opening up in Guyuan last September devouring a taxi cab whole. Fortunately unlike the recent case in Xining there were no casualties. Like this story? Share it with a friend!  , https://www.rt.com/news/478183-china-sinkhole-kills-six/,
