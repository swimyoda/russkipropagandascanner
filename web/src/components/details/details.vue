        name: "Why Twitter and Facebook squelching the Hunter Biden story backfired",
        text: "It quickly became clear that in their attempts to strangle the Hunter Biden story two social media giants left themselves gasping for air. Twitter and Facebook took major steps to squelch the New York Post piece but wound up giving it far more attention than if they had done nothing and let their millions of users share it freely. For Twitter in particular if you had to come up with a plan to reinforce conservative complaints about its liberal bias you could hardly do better than for the tech giant to lock the Trump campaign's account. Not to mention that of press secretary Kayleigh McEnany as well. Hashtag: #Fail In fact Twitter chief Jack Dorsey admitted in a tweet that the company's conduct--censoring stories and locking accounts with little public explanation--was unacceptable. You got that right Jack. But then he didn't do anything to fix it apparently viewing the self-inflicted wound as just a PR problem. Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans plan to subpoena Dorsey next week. TWITTER LOCKS OFFICIAL TRUMP CAMPAIGN ACCOUNT OVER SHARING HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook was only slightly more restrained limiting the Post story's distribution through its secret algorithm while referring it to an outside fact-checker--the results of which are still not in. Uh how many negative stories about Trump have both companies tried to silence no matter what the sourcing? No wonder President Trump was telling a North Carolina rally yesterday that the Bidens got rich while America got robbed...Big Tech is censoring these stories to try to get Biden out of this impossible jam. It was a gift from the social media gods. And you know who else is blacking out the story? CNN and MSNBC except for a couple of parenthetical mentions and Joe Scarborough briefly scolding the two tech companies for blocking the story. As for the Post story itself well it's a strange one. First let me say that the business that Hunter Biden did or attempted to do in Ukraine and elsewhere while his father was vice president was an embarrassment. He was profiteering on a family connection which may be common in Washington but is no less seedy. He admitted to a mistake months ago in a GMA interview while insisting he had done nothing unethical. But this was pretty fully aired during the Trump impeachment saga and I think much of the public concluded that Joe Biden didn't take explicit steps to help his son (yes he got that prosecutor fired in what he says was an anti-corruption drive) but probably looked the other way. Now less than three weeks before the election Rudy Giuliani obtains and gives the Rupert Murdoch tabloid email exchanges with Hunter in which an executive from the Ukrainian company Burisma (Hunter served on the board) thanked him for the opportunity to meet his father then the VP.   The Biden campaign said no such meeting took place then backtracked slightly to say it's possible but unlikely there was a brief hello at some point. How the president's personal lawyer got those emails is a tangled tale involving John MacIsaac who runs a computer repair shop in Wilmington. He told reporters he is legally blind and thinks but is not certain that Hunter Biden brought in three laptops with hard drive problems and never returned to pick them up. MacIsaac a Republican says he discovered some of these emails and eventually told the FBI keeping a copy when the bureau subpoenaed it.   Giuliani told Sirius XM yesterday that Hunter was drunk when he brought in the laptops. The Post was tipped off by Steve Bannon who is under indictment in an unrelated case. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Separately the New York Times which had reported that Burisma was hacked by Russian intelligence said yesterday that U.S. intelligence analysts picked up chatter that stolen Burisma emails would be leaked in the form of an October surprise. Just in case there wasn't enough intrigue. The Post separately reported Hunter's correspondence with Chinese executives in which Hunter Biden stood to make millions from a deal--but these emails were from 2017 after his father left office. In an interesting twist two reporters who questioned the initial Post story on Twitter--the New York Times' Maggie Haberman and Politico's Jake Sherman--took heat from the left for daring to mention its existence.   Liberal Times columnist Michelle Goldberg for instance wrote: You're really going to help Giuliani and Bannon launder this bull-- into the news cycle? A senior producer for MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell urged people not to share or link to the story. The better journalistic response to a story that is viewed with suspicion is to do more reporting.   The attempts at erasing it from the digital square as Twitter and Facebook are finding out can backfire big time.",

        name: "Haskins & Talgo: Facebook and Twitter trying to help Biden become president by suppressing NY Post story",
        text: "The New York Post delivered bombshell reports Wednesday and Thursday revealing emails that appear to show Joe Biden's son Hunter pursued and in some cases secured lucrative deals with businesses in Ukraine and China by offering access to then-Vice President Biden and potentially by offering other favors. This could end up being the biggest story of this year's presidential race. Among other discoveries in the emails is an important message indicating that Hunter Biden set up a meeting between Joe Biden and a top executive at an energy company in Ukraine Burisma Holdings. BEN SHAPIRO SHREDS 'DUMBASS' TWITTER CEO JACK DORSEY OVER BLOCKED HUNTER BIDEN REPORT: 'IT'S A CLOWN SHOW' The meeting allegedly occurred less than a year prior to Joe Biden using his position as vice president to pressure the Ukrainian government into dismissing its top prosecutor Viktor Shokin who had been conducting an investigation into the very same energy company. Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma despite having no expertise in the energy industry in 2014 not long after President Barack Obama put Joe Biden in charge of U.S. relations with Ukraine. The emails obtained by The New York Post also show a top executive at Burisma asking Hunter Biden for advice on how you could use your influence to help the company as well as separate messages showing Hunter Biden actively pursuing deals involving a top energy firm in China that would be interesting for me and my family. If accurate The New York Post's reports could have a monumental impact on the presidential election now underway. It appears that at the very least Joe Biden lied to the American people he repeatedly insisted he had nothing to do with Hunter's business dealings and it seems Joe Biden was engaged in highly unethical behavior using his office to enrich his son. At worst Joe Biden may have broken federal law. But as important as this incredible story is there is a much bigger story looming in the background: the way social media giants Facebook and Twitter responded to The New York Post reporting. Following the  Post article's publication Facebook and Twitter deliberately limited the news story's distribution and blocked key figures from discussing it over their social media platforms. While I will intentionally not link to the New York Post I want be clear that this story is eligible to be fact checked by Facebook's third-party fact checking partners wrote Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone in a tweet posted Wednesday. In the meantime we are reducing its distribution on our platform. Following its decision to block the spread of The New York Post article on Twitter a spokesperson for the company said: In line with our Hacked Materials Policy as well as our approach to blocking URLs we are taking action to block any links to or images of the material in question on Twitter. Censorship by Facebook and Twitter of The New York Post's report on Hunter and Joe Biden is an outrageous example of social media companies' proclivity to silence conservative content and bury negative stories about the left. This is perhaps the most important attempt ever made by a social media company to alter the outcome of an American election. If Facebook and Twitter had applied similar protocols to stories meant to hurt President Trump they would have never allowed users to share the countless articles published by mainstream outlets about unverified accounts of the Trump campaign allegedly colluding with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election. They also would have blocked the recent New York Times report about President Trump's tax records. Yet social media giants allowed those articles to be shared widely. Why? Because social media companies are now working tirelessly to protect Democrats and destroy the Republican Party. They are partisan institutions masquerading as open platforms and operate daily as extensions of America's left. The blatant censorship displayed by Facebook and Twitter regarding The New York Post story should send a chill down the spine of every American. What these companies are doing in this crucial period when voting has already begun in the Nov. 3 election is reprehensible and dangerous for the preservation of our constitutional republic. Facebook and Twitter are two of the largest distributors of news in the world. Twelve percent of all U.S. adults say they access news sites on Twitter. And 43 percent of adults say they get news from Facebook. If Facebook Twitter and other tech giants are permitted to ban the sharing of news stories published by reputable outlets they can ban virtually any form of political speech. This is dangerous because free speech is the foundation upon which all free societies exist. Many on the left and even some on the right argue that because Facebook and Twitter are private companies they should be allowed to ban anything they want on their platforms. As libertarians we are sympathetic to that argument. We believe that in an open marketplace companies should have the freedom to set their own rules and consumers should vote for the services they like with their dollars time and product use. But social media companies do not operate in a truly free market. They benefit from special legal protections granted to them by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which allows them to escape legal liability for erroneous information posted by third parties on their site. In a perfectly free-market system platforms would be held liable when users publish illicit content on their website. The only reason that isn't the case is because the federal government has created special rules that permit Facebook and Twitter to operate in their current forms. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER These companies have made billions of dollars because of these unique legal protections. And how have they repaid the American people? By refusing to operate in good faith and silencing speech that's inconvenient for their political allies. Now the tech titans are wielding more power than ever. With a single keystroke they have the power to conceal information that the public has a right to know. It's long past time for Congress to repeal Section 230 and replace it with a new federal law that would grant special liability protections to only those social media companies that sincerely work toward providing open platforms that protect not punish or silence all forms of political speech as well as many other forms of speech. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Reasonable restrictions on pornography extreme violence and other content not suited for mass distribution should be allowed of course. But social media companies should never be permitted to ban Americans' political speech whether that speech come from liberals conservatives libertarians or socialists while also earning a fortune from legal carve-outs granted to them by the same people who are being unjustly silenced. A failure to act now would only embolden the social media giants to continue expanding their speech bans and further limit the ability for people of all political social and religious persuasions from engaging in open dialogue.

        name: "Wisconsin governor may activate National Guard to fill poll worker shortages",
        text: "Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said he plans to activate the Wisconsin National Guard to make up for poll worker shortages in dozens of municipalities across the state. 'The Guard will play a role as much as they are needed' Evers said. TRUMP STUMPING IN FLORIDA GEORGIA AS BIDEN HEADS TO MICHIGAN AFTER COMPETING TOWN HALLS Wisconsin -- a battleground state that President Trump won by less than a percentage point in 2016 -- is relatively well prepared less than two weeks away from Election Day. Despite surging cases of coronavirus that have shattered records in recent weeks only about 180 poll workers more are needed out of 30000 that staff polling sites in 51 municipalities  the Wisconsin Elections Commission said on Thursday. The shortage is far less than during  the state's primaries in August when polling sites were lacking 700  workers forcing some centers to close. The coronavirus crisis coupled with fewer polling sites at that time saw long wait times for voters causing concerns of lower turnout.   FIRST PRESIDENTIAL VOTE CAST USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY The largest shortfalls are in Green Bay where 30 workers were needed and in Menomonie in the western part of the state near Minnesota where there was  a shortage of 15. Watertown City Clerk Elissa Friedl said Thursday that she had just asked the elections commission to remove her city from the list because she was confident all 100 people needed to work the polls on Election Day would be available.   Even if people back out close to the election Friedl said she has city employees at the ready to fill vacancies. Watertown has about 24000 residents and is located midway between Madison and Milwaukee. Clerks are doing a good job of recruiting and Wisconsin citizens are stepping up in response to either calls to action or problems that occurred in April Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesman Reid Magney said according to the Associated Press. MAN WHO FIRED SHOTS BEFORE KYLE RITTENHOUSE IN KENOSHA CHARGED Election officials advocacy groups and others in Wisconsin and across the country have been recruiting poll workers more aggressively this year because older volunteers have been backing out due to concerns over the coronavirus. A record-high number of Wisconsin voters are also casting absentee ballots which election officials say should cut down on lines on Election Day as well. As of Thursday more than 785000 voters had returned absentee ballots. That is more than 26% of the total number who voted in the 2016 presidential election.

Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...Critics slam  NBC town hall that looked   more like a 'debate'  ABC for pitching 'softballs' to BidenCritics piled on NBC News for devoting its town hall to what appeared to be a 'debate' between President Trump and moderator Savannah Guthrie while Democratic nominee Joe Biden was lobbed 'softballs' at his ABC News town hall. Viewers who tuned into the Peacock Network expected to hear questions from voters. However Guthrie spent most of the first 20 minutes grilling Trump on masks and White supremacy.

        name: "Hunter Biden emails texts reveal wild life pained soul",
        text: "Hunter Biden's emails and texts show not just a politician's troubled son angling for lucrative overseas business deals they also reveal a concerned father a fun-loving friend and a man tortured by the deaths that have devastated his family. In a text-message exchange from 2018 eldest daughter Naomi named after Biden's late sister who was killed with their mother Neilia in a 1972 car crash pleaded with her dad for emergency cash. Can you put 150 in my account it was just declined for lyft to airport sorry sorry sorry the now-26-year-old Columbia Law student asked. Yes I can but Naomi you ­really have to start to realize that once you are out of school the chances of you living like your father is a billionaire when he's really given all his money away- is going to be a bit of a shock Hunter answered. I know I promise ill be much better this year!!!!!!!!!!! Promise Naomi wrote back. Naomi didn't return a request for comment but neither Hunter Biden's lawyer nor Joe Biden's campaign have  disputed the validity of the trove of data  that The Post obtained after being extracted from a MacBook Pro laptop. The owner of a Delaware computer-repair shop said the machine was dropped off in April 2019 but never retrieved. A computer camera roll of nearly 25000 images is loaded with sexually explicit selfies and porn (which The Post is not publishing) but also has snapshots from Biden's childhood and vacations. CLICK HERE TO SEE  PHOTOS IN THE NEW YORK POST And while some of the more than 11550 emails involve Biden's former job on the board of the  Ukrainian energy company Burisma  and  his dealings with the now-bankrupt CEFC China Energy Co. most of his messages are innocuous and personal in nature. A 2019 text exchange shows Biden corresponding with a pal Mehall Ledwith who was celebrating St. Patrick's Day at The Chelsea Bell bar in Manhattan. That sounds like fun. Where dat Biden wrote. Another exchange from 2018 shows Biden inviting a friend to The Hollywood Roosevelt hotel in LA saying he has a cabana suite and is partying like an idiot ass rock star. Haha sounds ridiculously fun then. I can maybe try to come later Andrew Boshop wrote. I'll make your night dude Biden replied. Ledwith said he didn't recall the St. Patrick's Day exchange but said he and Biden were friends who have communicated by text. Boshop didn't return a request for comment. TWITTER ANNOUNCES NEW POLICIES AFTER CONTROVERSIAL HANDLING OF HUNTER BIDEN REPORT Biden  who has acknowledged struggling with drug and alcohol problems   also poured his heart out in a lengthy email that he sent to himself in 2015 about three weeks after his brother former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden died of brain cancer. In the nearly-800-word missive which is filled with misspellings Biden recounts going to church as a child with his father and brother on every Sunday growing up as well as the Mass he attended the day following Beau's death. I missed his touch   I could feel him there in our [midst] I could smell him-but he wasn't there he was gone Biden wrote.
